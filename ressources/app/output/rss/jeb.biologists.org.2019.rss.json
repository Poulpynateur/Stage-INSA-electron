Glycogen abundance in NKA-rich cells was lower in starved sharks compared with 24 h post-fed sharks, reflecting higher energy demand for acid secretion during normal activity and glycogen replenishment during the post-feeding period. Conversely, glycogen abundance in VHA-rich cells was high in starved sharks and it became depleted post-feeding. Furthermore, inactive cells with cytoplasmic VHA had large glycogen stores and active cells with basolateral VHA had depleted glycogen stores. These results indicate that glycogen is a main energy source in both NKA- and VHA-rich cells, and point to differential energy use associated with net acid and net base secretion, respectively.","keywords":"pH regulation, Alkaline tide, Alkalosis, Metabolism, ATPase, Acidosis, Triakis semifasciata, Triakis semifasciata, Energy","title":"Differential glycogen utilization in shark acid- and base-regulatory gill cells","authors":"Jinae N.

This study investigated how goats adjust the stiffness of their hindlimbs to accommodate surfaces of different stiffness. Goats provide a compelling animal model for studying leg stiffness modulation, because they skillfully ambulate over a range of substrates that vary in compliance. To investigate the adjustments that goats make when walking over such substrates, ground reaction forces and three-dimensional trajectories of hindlimb markers were recorded as goats walked on rigid, rubber and foam surfaces. Net joint moments, power and work at the hip, knee, ankle and metatarsophalangeal joints were estimated throughout stance via inverse dynamics. Hindlimb stiffness was estimated from plots of total leg force versus total leg length, and individual joint stiffness was estimated from plots of joint moment versus joint angle. Our results support the hypothesis that goats modulate hindlimb stiffness in response to surface stiffness; specifically, hindlimb stiffness decreased on the more compliant surfaces (P<0.002). Estimates of joint stiffness identified hip and ankle muscles as the primary drivers of these adjustments. When humans run on compliant surfaces, they generally increase leg stiffness to preserve their center-of-mass mechanics. We did not estimate center-of-mass mechanics in this study; nevertheless, our estimates of hindlimb stiffness suggest that goats exhibit a different behavior. This study offers new insight into mechanisms that allow quadrupeds to modulate their gait mechanics when walking on surfaces of variable compliance.","keywords":"Locomotion, Quadruped, Biomechanics, Inverse dynamics, Gait, Quasi-stiffness, Joint stiffness","title":"Goats decrease hindlimb stiffness when walking over compliant surfaces","authors":"Tyler R.

These include Na+/H+-exchanger, V-H+-ATPase, cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase, HCO3−-transporters, and Rhesus proteins. Consequently, renal acid output in the form of protons and NH4+ increases. Little, however, is known about mechanistic details of renal acid-base regulation in C. auratus and teleost fishes in general. The present study applied the Scanning Ion-selective Electrode Technique (SIET) to measure proton flux in proximal, distal and connecting tubules of goldfish. We detected increased H+ efflux into the extracellular fluid from the tubule in fed animals, resulting from paracellular back-flux of H+ through the tight junction. By applying inhibitors for selected acid-base regulatory epithelial transporters, we found that cytosolic carbonic anhydrase and HCO3− transporters were important in mediating H+ flux in all three tubule segments of fed goldfish. Contrastingly, V-H+-ATPase seemed to play a role for H+ flux only in proximal and distal tubule, and Na+/H+-exchanger in proximal and connecting tubule. We develop working models for transport of acid-base relevant equivalents (H+, HCO3−, NH3/NH4+) for each tubule segment in C. auratus kidney. While the proximal tubule appears to play a major role in both H+ secretion and HCO3− reabsorption, the distal and connecting tubules seem to mainly serve for HCO3− reabsorption and NH3/NH4+ secretion.","keywords":"Freshwater teleost, Renal epithelium, Acidosis, SIET","title":"Section-specific H+ fluxes in renal tubules of fasted and fed goldfish","authors":"Sandra Fehsenfeld, Dennis Kolosov, Chris M.

Studies of free-ranging, descending alcids have found that alcids accelerate in the direction of travel during both their upstroke and downstroke, but only at depths<20m, whereas studies of alcids swimming horizontally report upstroke-based acceleration to be rare (≤ 16% of upstrokes). We hypothesized that swimming trajectory, via its interaction with buoyancy, determines the magnitude of acceleration produced during the upstroke. Thus, we studied the stroke-acceleration relationships of five species of alcids swimming freely at the Alaska SeaLife Center using videography and kinematic analysis. Contrary to our prediction, we found that upstroke-based acceleration is very common (87% of upstrokes) during both descending and horizontal swimming.

Photo credit: Barbara Tomotani., When Barbara Tomotani, at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO), noticed that climate change was having an effect on pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) nesting, she was concerned: it was occurring earlier in the season. However, she was even more shocked when she realised that the timing of the moulting season, when the males shed their feathers, was also shifting. ‘But it was advancing faster’, says Tomotani, which might impact the birds’ flight and could impair their ability to raise their chicks. Yet it was unclear how much of a toll moulting takes on flycatcher fathers. The loss didn't appear to impair their flight once airborne, yet the fathers that had begun early moults seemed to take a back-seat feeding their young, leaving most of the work to mum. So when a new researcher at Wageningen University, Florian Muijres, gave a guest talk at NIOO about his work comparing the flight of bats and birds, Tomotani realised that she had found the ideal collaborator to investigate the challenges faced by moulting pied flycatcher fathers as they struggle to feed their chicks., ‘We were studying flycatchers breeding in nest boxes’, says Tomotani, who collected returning males when their chicks were 7 days old to remove two primary feathers from each wing (the second and third from the wing tip) to simulate the disruption caused by moulting. Tomotani then returned when the chicks were ready to fledge (5 days later), only this time she took the males to NIOO to test how well they took off after losing the feathers. ‘The most difficult part was the logistics of running this experiment. The indoor flight tests were done at the same time as the fieldwork, so it required a lot of planning and coordination to make sure things ran smoothly’, Tomotani recalls. Fortunately, the birds were extremely cooperative when in captivity. ‘Almost all of the birds flew immediately upwards as soon as we opened the release box’, says Tomotani, who filmed the departures in 3D before painstakingly tracking the positions of 14 points on each bird's wings and body to reconstruct the manoeuvre in fine detail., However, when Muijres measured the take-off speeds, he was astonished that the birds that had lost wing feathers were taking to the air as fast as the fathers with intact plumage (∼2.5 m s−1). Also, they were somehow generating similar lift forces. ‘We expected that the birds with moult gaps would fly upwards less quickly’, the pair says. So how had the birds made up for their lost feathers?, Muijres calculated the size of the gap in the wing's feathers and realised that it was 31% smaller than the distance between the same feathers when the plumage was intact; the flycatchers had reduced the gap, although it wasn't closed entirely. But what other mechanisms were the birds using to compensate for their feather loss?, Analysing the angle of the wing surface relative to the oncoming air throughout the wing beats, Muijres realised that the birds with gaps in their wing feathers were tipping the wings more (increasing the angle of attack) to compensate for the reduced wing surface area, which, in turn, increased the force generated by the wing. He suspects that the additional effort required for the birds to become airborne while moulting could account for the fathers’ dereliction of duty. ‘These wingbeat adjustments might be energetically costly’, says Muijres, and Tomotani is keen to learn more about the impact of moulting on the ecology of songbirds and how climate change is altering their behaviour.","keywords":"","title":"Pied flycatcher fathers compensate for moult at take-off","authors":"Kathryn Knight","origin":"INSIDE JEB","pub_date":"28 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/10/jeb206193?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Given that hematophagous insects ingest large quantities of blood in a single meal, they must undergo a rapid post-prandial diuresis in order to maintain homeostasis.

Three to four hours after the meal, the diuretic process finishes, and the animal enters an antidiuretic state to ensure water conservation until the next blood intake. The diuretic and antidiuretic processes are tightly regulated by serotonin and neuropeptides in this insect. In the present work, we report that the neuropeptide precursor CCHamide2 is involved in the regulation of the post-prandial diuresis in R. prolixus.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a hormone presenting opposite effects in the two osmoregulatory organs (i.e. midgut and Malpighian tubules) in insects, probably reflecting the importance of a well-tuned diuretic process in hematophagous insects during different moments after the blood meal.","keywords":"Insect, Anterior midgut, Malpighian tubules, Kissing bug, Hematophagy","title":"The neuropeptide CCHamide2 regulates diuresis in the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius prolixus","authors":"Natalia Capriotti, Juan P.

Muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm), a recessive titin mutation in mice, was used as a tool to study the role of titin in activation-dependence of optimal length and length-dependence of Ca2+ sensitivity. We measured the shift in optimal length between tetanic and twitch stimulation in mdm and wild type muscles, and the length-dependence of Ca2+ sensitivity at short and long sarcomere lengths in mdm and wild type fiber bundles. The results indicate that the mdm mutation leads to a loss of activation-dependence of optimal length without the expected change in length-dependence of Ca2+ sensitivity, demonstrating that these properties are not linked, as previously suggested. Furthermore, mdm muscles produced maximum tetanic stress during sub-optimal filament overlap at lengths similar to twitch contractions in both genotypes, but the difference explains less than half of the observed reduction in active force of mdm muscles. Mdm muscles also exhibited increased electromechanical delay, contraction and relaxation times, and decreased rate of force development in twitch contractions. We conclude that the small deletion in titin associated with mdm in skeletal muscles alters force production, suggesting an important regulatory role for titin in active force production. The molecular mechanisms for titin's role in regulating muscle force production remain to be elucidated.","keywords":"Activation-dependent properties, Isometric force production, Force transmission, Length-dependent properties, Submaximal force production, Titin/connectin","title":"Optimal length, calcium sensitivity, and twitch characteristics of skeletal muscles from mdm mice with a deletion in N2A titin","authors":"Anthony L.

Thirty-two male rats (8 weeks old, 200±17 g body mass) were randomly allocated to control, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate free acid supplementation (HMB), eccentric resistance training (ERT), and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate free acid supplementation plus eccentric resistance training (HMB+ERT) groups.

It also turns out that – like humans – some are partial to a shot of caffeine. ‘Caffeine is a secondary plant metabolite found in some nectars’, says Tianfei Peng, of Johannes-Gutenberg University of Mainz, Germany, explaining that the stimulant definitely affects European honey bees (Apis mellifera); they forage more, drink more nectar, have better memories and are naturally attracted to poor-quality flowers, potentially at the colony's expense. But how does the caffeine-laced nectar produced by the trees that grow our daily brew affect the tropical species of stingless bee that pollinate them?, Teaming up with colleagues from his own institute, the Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil, and from Goethe University of Frankfurt, Germany, Peng trained wild Brazilian Plebia droryana to dine at feeders dosed with either a weak or a strong sugar solution and compared how the bees responded to the fake nectar when they added a small or large shot of caffeine. Remarkably, the bees weren't bothered; they were equally keen to forage at the feeders regardless of whether they were getting a caffeine hit. However, they were definitely more enthusiastic when Peng increased the sugar concentration in the fake nectar, buzzing more around the feeder with the stronger of the two simulated nectar solutions. So, it seems that P. droryana are not susceptible to the highly charged effects of caffeine, but they are motivated by the quality of the nectar that they sip, and the team suspects that the busy South American insects may have become immune to the stimulant or simply lack the wiring that makes other bees sensitive to one of our favourite refreshments.","keywords":"","title":"Tropical stingless bees don't react to caffeine","authors":"Kathryn Knight","origin":"INSIDE JEB","pub_date":"17 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/10/jeb206441?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Honey bees can communicate navigational information which makes them unique amongst all prominent insect navigators. Returning foragers recruit nest mates to a food source by communicating flight distance and direction using a small scale walking pattern: the waggle dance. It is still unclear how bees transpose flight information to generate corresponding dance information. In single feeder shift experiments, we monitored for the first time how individual bees update dance duration after a shift of feeder distance. Interestingly, the majority of bees (86%) needed two or more foraging trips to update dance duration. This finding demonstrates that transposing flight navigation information to dance information is not a reflexive behavior. Furthermore, many bees showed intermediate dance durations during the update process, indicating that honey bees highly likely use two memories: (i) a recently acquired navigation experience and (ii) a previously stored flight experience. Double shift experiments, in which the feeder was moved forward-backward, created an experimental condition in which honey bee foragers did not update dance duration; suggesting the involvement of more complex memory processes. Our behavioral paradigm allows the dissociation of foraging and dance activity and opens a possibility to study the molecular and neural processes underlying the waggle dance behavior.","keywords":"Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera, waggle dance communication, Spatial memories, Private and social information, Retroactive interference","title":"Honey bees flexibly use two navigational memories when updating dance distance information","authors":"Arumoy Chatterjee, Ebi A.

Mechanical advantage showed some predictive power at the interspecific level, but generally not within species, except for the deep masseter in Rattus.

We tested this hypothesis using honey bee (Apis mellifera) division of labor as a model system by performing bioinformatic analyses of previously published brain transcriptomic profiles together with new RNAi and behavioral experiments. The bioinformatic analyses identified five TFs that exhibited strong signatures of regulatory plasticity as a function of division of labor.

Results showed that changes in regulatory relationships of these TFs were associated with behavioral state, social context and endocrine state. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that TF-target relationships in the brain are altered in conjunction with behavior and social context. They also suggest that one mechanism for this plasticity involves pleiotropic TFs high in regulatory hierarchies producing behavior-specific transcriptional responses by activating different downstream TFs, to induce discrete context-dependent transcriptional cascades.

How these abilities are shared among the different castes and the long-term persistence of memory are now being elucidated in diverse systems, work that should shed light on general principles underlying cognitive evolution. Here we provide the first evidence of olfactory learning and long-term olfactory memory in all three castes of an Asian hornet, Vespa velutina. Using the first proboscis extension reflex assay developed for hornets or wasps, we found that all hornet castes could learn and remember odours associated with a food reward. Moreover, long-lasting memory was retained without significant decay in gynes (virgin queens) and drones even up to 30 d. Workers did not survive for 30 d. Drones learned and remembered simple odorant molecules and gyne sex pheromone with equal facility. These results increase our understanding of the outstanding cognitive abilities of social insects and suggest the likely importance of long-lasting memory in different castes of the same species.","keywords":"Wasp, Vespa velutina, Vespa velutina, Caste, Cognition, Olfactory learning, Memory","title":"Hornets possess long-lasting olfactory memories","authors":"Zhiwen Gong, Ken Tan, James C.

These values overall aligned with the tissue H2S-generating enzymatic activity.

The current conceptual framework for division of labour in social insects is provided by the response-threshold model. This model posits that the differences between individuals (i.e. between-individual variability) in responsiveness to task-associated stimuli is a key feature for task specialisation. The consistency of individual behaviours (i.e. within-individual variability) in task performance represents an additional but little-considered component driving robust patterns of division of labour. On the one hand, the presence of workers with a high level of within-individual variability presumably allows colonies to rapidly adapt to external fluctuations. On the other hand, a reduced degree of within-individual variability promotes a stricter specialisation in task performance, thereby limiting the costs of task switching. The ideal balance between flexibility and canalisation probably varies depending on the developmental stage of the colony to satisfy its changing needs. Here, I introduce the main sources of within-individual variability in behaviours in social insects and I review neural correlates accompanying the changes in behavioural flexibility. I propose the hypothesis that the positive scaling between group size and the intensity of task specialisation, a relationship consistently reported both within and between taxa, may rely on reduced within-individual variability via self-organised processes linked to the quality of brood care. Overall, I emphasise the need for a more comprehensive characterisation of the response dynamics of individuals to better understand the mechanisms shaping division of labour in social insects.","keywords":"Ant, Group size, Task specialisation, Ontogeny, Plasticity","title":"Within-individual behavioural variability and division of labour in social insects","authors":"Raphaël Jeanson","origin":"COMMENTARY","pub_date":"24 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/10/jeb190868?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Honeybees use visual and olfactory cues to detect flowers during foraging trips.

The present study used stimulation with UV, blue and green light to evoke distinct photoreceptor activities in the compound eye and two odour components (geraniol, citronellol). To test if a compound of both modalities is perceived as the sum of its elements (elemental processing) or as a unique cue (configural processing), we combined monochromatic light with single odour components in positive (PP) and negative patterning (NP) experiments. During PP, the compound of two modalities was rewarded, whereas the single elements were not. For NP, stimuli comprising a single modality were rewarded, whereas the olfactory-visual compound was not. Furthermore, we compared the differentiation abilities between two light stimuli that were or were not part of an olfactory–visual compound. Interestingly, the behavioural performances revealed a prominent case of configural processing, but only in those cases when UV light was an element of an olfactory–visual compound.

These behavioural and GM modifications over time could be the consequence of the resilience of the GM to recover the equilibrium present in the E+ host, which is in part driven by the host genotype.

Some plants, however, add compounds to nectar to manipulate pollinators. Caffeine is a secondary plant metabolite found in some nectars that affects foraging in pollinators. In honeybees, caffeine increases foraging and recruitment to mediocre food sources, which might benefit the plant, but potentially harms the colonies. For the largest group of social bees, the stingless bees, the effect of caffeine on foraging behaviour has not been tested yet, despite their importance for tropical ecosystems. More generally, recruitment and foraging dynamics are not well understood in most species. We examined whether caffeine affects the foraging behaviour of the stingless bee Plebeia droryana, which frequently visits plants that produce caffeinated nectar and pollen. We trained bees to food sources containing field-realistic concentrations of sugar and caffeine. Caffeine did not cause P. droryana to increase foraging frequency and persistence. We observed P. droryana recruiting to food sources; however, this behaviour was also not affected by caffeine. Instead we found that higher sugar concentrations caused bees to increase foraging effort. Thus, unlike in other pollinators, foraging behaviour in this stingless bee is not affected by caffeine. As the Brazilian P. droryana population that we tested has been exposed to coffee over evolutionary time periods, our results raise the possibility that it may have evolved a tolerance towards this central nervous system stimulant. Alternatively, stingless bees may show physiological responses to caffeine that differ from those of other bee groups.","keywords":"Pollination, Recruitment, Behaviour","title":"Resource profitability, but not caffeine, affects individual and collective foraging in the stingless bee Plebeia droryana","authors":"Tianfei Peng, Francisca H.

Consequently, mainly natural selection is considered to have shaped the attachment system in relation to weight load and substrate. However, sexual selection may also be important because many animals attach to the partner during mating. Both hypotheses generate opposing predictions in species where males are smaller than females. Natural selection predicts the attachment ability to scale positively with load, and hence body size, and so be larger in females than males. Sexual selection predicts attachment forces in males to be larger than females, despite the males’ smaller size because males benefit from uninterrupted copulation by stronger attachment to the female. We tested these predictions in the common bedbug Cimex lectularius, a species in which both sexes, as well as nymphs, regularly carry large loads, blood meals of up to three times the body weight. By measuring attachment forces to smooth surfaces and analysing in-situ fixed copulating pairs and the morphology of attachment devices, we show i) that males generate twice the attachment force of females, although weighing 15 % less, ii) that males adhere to females during copulation using hairy tibial adhesive pads, iii) more setae, and more setae per unit area, in the pads of males than females but no difference in shape of tarsal setae, and iv) the absence of hairy tibial attachment pads and low attachment force in nymphs. These results are consistent with a sexually selected function of attachment in bedbugs. Controlling sperm transfer and mate guarding by attaching to females during copulation may also shape the evolution of male attachment structures in other species. More generally, we hypothesise the existence of arms races of male attachment structures and female counterparts to impede attachment which may result in a similar evolutionary diversification as male genitalia.","keywords":"Adhesive setae, Centrifugal force test, Fossulae spongiosa, Resilin, Safety factor, Sexual conflict, Tibial setae","title":"Evidence for a sexually selected function of the attachment system in bedbugs Cimex lectularius (Heteroptera, Cimicidae)","authors":"Klaus Reinhardt, Dagmar Voigt, Stanislav N.

Seasonal life history polyphenisms are common and include faster growth and development under direct development than diapause. However, the physiological underpinnings of this difference remain poorly known despite its significance for understanding the evolution of polyphenisms. We measured respiration and metabolic rates through the penultimate and final larval instars in the butterfly Pieris napi and show that directly developing larvae grew and developed faster and had a higher metabolic rate than larvae entering pupal diapause. The metabolic divergence appeared only in the final instar, that is, after the induction of developmental pathway that takes place in the penultimate instar in P. napi. The accumulation of fat reserves during the final larval instar was similar under diapause and direct development, which was unexpected as diapause is predicted to select for exaggerated reserve accumulation. This suggests that overwinter survival in diapause does not require larger energy reserves than direct development, likely because of metabolic suppression in diapause pupae. The results, nevertheless, demonstrate that physiological changes coincide with the divergence of life histories between the alternative developmental pathways, thus elucidating the proximate basis of seasonal life history polyphenisms.","keywords":"Allometry, Diapause, Direct development, Fat reserve, Life history, Metabolic rate, Polyphenism","title":"Developmental plasticity in metabolism but not in energy reserve accumulation in a seasonally polyphenic butterfly","authors":"Sami M.

Thus, we hypothesized that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development induces morphological changes that remain after hatching. To test this hypothesis, chicken embryos were incubated entirely (21 days) under normoxia or partially under hypoxia (15% O2 during days 12 to 18). Lung structures, including air capillaries, blood capillaries, infundibula, atria, parabronchial lumen, bronchi, blood vessels larger than capillaries and interparabronchial tissue, in 1- and 10-day-old chicks were analyzed using light microscopy-assisted stereology. Tissue barrier and surface area of air capillaries were measured using electron microscopy-assisted stereology, allowing for calculation of the anatomical diffusion factor. Hypoxia increased the relative volumes of air and blood capillaries, structures directly involved in gas exchange, but decreased the relative volumes of atria in both groups of chicks, and the parabronchial lumen in older chicks. Accordingly, the surface area of the air capillaries and the anatomical diffusion factor were increased under hypoxic incubation. Treatment did not alter total lung volume, relative volumes of infundibula, bronchi, blood vessels larger than capillaries, interparabronchial tissue or the tissue barrier of any group. We conclude that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development leads to a morphological remodeling, characterized by increased volume density and respiratory surface area of structures involved in gas exchange at the expense of structures responsible for air conduction in chicks up to 10 days old.","keywords":"Incubation, Blood capillary, Air capillary, Lung, Blood–gas tissue barrier, Chicken","title":"Parabronchial remodeling in chicks in response to embryonic hypoxia","authors":"Lara do Amaral-Silva, Markus Lambertz, Fernando José Zara, Wilfried Klein, Luciane Helena Gargaglioni, Kênia Cardoso Bícego","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"16 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/10/jeb197970?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Elaterid beetles have evolved to “click” their bodies in a unique maneuver. When this maneuver is initiated from a stationary position on a solid substrate, it results in a jump not carried out by the traditional means of jointed appendages (i.e. legs). Elaterid beetles belong to a group of organisms that amplify muscle power through morphology to produce extremely fast movements. Elaterids achieve power amplifications through a hinge situated in the thoracic region. The actuating components of the hinge are a peg and mesosternal lip, two conformal parts that latch to keep the body in a brace position until their release, the “click,” that is the fast launch maneuver. While prior studies have identified this mechanism, they were focused on the ballistics of the launched body or limited to a single species. In this work, we identify specific morphological details of the hinges of four click beetle species, namely Alaus oculatus (L.), Paralellosthetus attenuatus (Say), Lacon discoideus (Weber) and Melanotus spp. (Eschscholtz), which vary in overall length from 11.3 to 38.8 mm. The measurements from Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) and Computerized Tomography (CT) were combined to provide comparative structural information on both exterior and interior features of the peg and mesosternal lip. Specifically, ESEM and CT reveal the morphology of the peg, which is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam. In the model, the externally applied force is estimated using a micromechanical experiment. The equivalent stiffness, defined as the ratio between the applied force and the peg tip deflection is estimated for all 4 species. The estimated peg tip deformation indicates that, under the applied forces, the peg is able to maintain the braced position of the hinge. This work comprehensively describes the critical function of the hinge anatomy through an integration of specific anatomical architecture and engineering mechanics for the first time.","keywords":"Click Beetle, Hinge morphology, Latching mechanism, Power-amplified maneuvers, Conformal surfaces","title":"Latching of the click beetle (Coleoptera: Elateridae) thoracic hinge enabled by the morphology and mechanics of conformal structures","authors":"O.

Therefore, we compared the liver and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and the redox status of young rats whose mothers underwent moderate endurance training (treadmill running) before and during gestation (T) with those of young rats from untrained mothers (C). Our results show a significant reduction in the spontaneous H2O2 release by liver and muscle mitochondria in the T versus C offspring (P<0.05). These changes were accompanied by alterations in oxygen consumption. Moreover, the percentage of short-chain fatty acids increased significantly in liver mitochondria from T offspring. This may lead to improvements in the fluidity and the flexibility of the membrane. In plasma, glutathione peroxidase activity and protein oxidation were significantly higher in T offspring than in C offspring (P<0.05). Such changes in plasma could represent an adaptive signal transmitted from mothers to their offspring.

Photo credit: Jan Sula., Fighting off an infection is never easy, but insects are prepared. By releasing antimicrobial peptides (mini-proteins) from the fat body – the insect equivalent of the liver – and mobilising specialised cells that target invading infections in the haemolymph (insect blood), insects are able to defend themselves when wounded or at risk of infection. However, Dalibor Kodrík and colleagues from the Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences, wondered whether a group of proteins known as vitellogenins – which are usually produced by female animals and go on to create egg yolk proteins – might also contribute to insect immunity. Kodrík says, ‘Studies in the silkworm and honeybee reported strong antibacterial activity of vitellogenins’. Could the proteins contribute to the immunity of his favourite insects, firebugs (Pyrrhocoris apterus)? Knowing that the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae, which infects insects with toxic Xenorhabdus bacteria, and the lethal Isaria fumosorosea fungus are used to control insect numbers, Kodrík decided to investigate whether either biological control agent triggers vitellogenin production in firebugs and whether the proteins offered any protection from these infections., After injecting one group of firebugs with the toxic nematodes and a second group with the fungus, Emad Ibrahim and Umesh Guatam collected the infected insects’ haemolymph and fat bodies several days later to find out whether the insects were producing vitellogenins to combat the infections. When they measured the levels of vitellogenin mRNA and protein, Radmila Čapková Frydrychová, Andrea Bednářová and Pavel Jedlička discovered that the nematode infection significantly boosted the males’ vitellogenin mRNA production 7.7-fold and protein 1.5-fold. However, the infection caused the females’ vitellogenin mRNA levels in the fat body to crash, dramatically dropping 150-fold, while their haemolymph vitellogenin protein levels also plummeted., In contrast, the male firebugs’ response to the slower developing fungal infection was only modest, while the females experienced the same haemolymph and fat body reductions in vitellogenin that the scientists had discovered in the nematode-infected insects. In addition, when the team tested the mortality rates from both infections, it seemed that the female firebugs were better protected than their male counterparts. And when Václav Krištu˚fek treated the nematode's toxic Xenorhabdus lodgers with vitellogenin, the bacteria succumbed, although the protein made little impact on the fungal infection., So, it appears that vitellogenin does contribute to the insect's immunity, offering some protection from nematode and fungal infections. Kodrík also suspects that the reduction in vitellogenin levels experienced by infected females may not be as unexpected as it first appears. ‘One can speculate that the vitellogenin level sufficient for effective defence against pathogens might be much lower than that required for nutritional supply of developing eggs’, says Čapková Frydrychová, who suggests that infected females may shut down non-essential processes, such as egg development, at times of crisis to invest energy in fighting the infection. And Kodrík is keen to discover whether the essential egg protein is also a key player in the immune response of other insects, including Drosophila, which could allow him to begin unravelling vitellogenin's antibiotic mechanism.","keywords":"","title":"Firebugs fight infection with egg yolk protein","authors":"Kathryn Knight","origin":"INSIDE JEB","pub_date":"24 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/10/jeb206185?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Prolonged stress can have long-lasting effects on an individual's physiology and growth.

We tested competing hypotheses on the character of developmental thermal plasticity using a full-factorial design with three developmental and adulthood temperatures within the natural thermal range of this species. To account for potential intraspecific differences, we examined flies from tropical (India) and temperate (Slovakia) climate zones. Our results show that flies from both populations raised at an intermediate developmental temperature (25°C) have comparable or higher early fecundity and fertility at all tested adulthood temperatures, while lower (17°C) or higher developmental temperatures (29°C) did not entail any advantage under the tested thermal regimes. Importantly, the superior thermal performance of flies raised at 25°C is apparent even after taking two traits positively associated with reproductive output into account: body size and ovariole number. Thus, in D. melanogaster, development at a given temperature does not necessarily provide any advantage in this thermal environment in terms of reproductive fitness.

We tested this theory by comparing the organ-specific mitochondrial response in female wild-derived house mice.

We measured liver and skeletal muscle mitochondrial density, respiratory performance, enzyme activity, and oxidant production, as well as markers of oxidative damage to tissues. In the liver, prior reproduction prevented a radiation-induced reduction in mitochondrial density and increased mitochondrial respiratory performance. In skeletal muscle, prior reproduction resulted in a radiation-induced decline in mitochondrial density which could reduce the bioenergetic capacity of skeletal muscle mitochondria. Yet, electron transport chain complex I activity in skeletal muscle, which dropped with reproduction, returned to control levels following oxidant exposure. The results of this investigation indicate that prior reproduction alters the response of mitochondria to an oxidative challenge in an organ-specific manner.

Egg maternal substances can have interacting effects, but experimental studies of the consequences of the combined variation in the egg concentration of such molecules are extremely rare, particularly as far as prenatal stages are concerned. We manipulated the yolk concentration of vitamin E and corticosterone, which are, respectively, the main antioxidant and the main glucocorticoid hormone in bird eggs, both independently and simultaneously, and we tested their separate and combined effects on growth and oxidative status in the liver and in the brain of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) embryos. Egg supplementation of relatively large physiological doses of corticosterone depressed embryo growth (total body mass, tarsus length and liver mass), whereas administration of vitamin E in association with corticosterone restored normal growth. Vitamin E did not affect embryo growth when administered alone. We further analysed the independent and combined effects of vitamin E and corticosterone on liver and brain total antioxidant capacity, the concentration of reactive oxygen molecules and lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E significantly reduced liver total antioxidant capacity, while corticosterone depressed brain lipid peroxidation. Prenatal exposure to vitamin E and corticosterone appears to have antagonistic effects on body growth, although vitamin E is not limiting in yellow-legged gull eggs. In combination with the results of previous experiments on the same species applying smaller experimental doses or focusing on the postnatal rather than prenatal life stages, our findings indicate that the effects of a physiological increase in the egg concentration of these substances can be life stage and dose specific, implying that generalizing prenatal effects of egg compounds may not be feasible.","keywords":"Antioxidant, Glucocorticoid hormone, Larus michahellis, Larus michahellis, Egg maternal substance, Embryo development","title":"Prenatal independent and combined effects of yolk vitamin E and corticosterone on embryo growth and oxidative status in the yellow-legged gull","authors":"Marco Parolini, Cristina Daniela Possenti, Simona Secomandi, Silvia Carboni, Manuela Caprioli, Diego Rubolini, Andrea Romano, Nicola Saino","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"16 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/10/jeb199265?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Unlike that of vertebrates, the penaeid shrimp stomach is of ectodermic origin and is thus covered by a cuticle that is sloughed upon molting. It is composed of two chambers, here called the anterior and posterior stomach chambers, ASC and PSC, respectively. The PSC contains a filtration structure variously called a pyloric filter, filter press, gastric filter or gastric sieve (GS), and the last of these will be used here. The GS resembles an elongated, inverted-V, dome-like, chitinous structure with a midline ridge that is integral to the ventral base of the PSC. The dome surface is covered with a carpet-like layer of minute, comb-like setae bearing laterally branching setulae. This carpet serves as a selective filter that excludes large partially digested food particles but allows smaller particles and soluble materials to enter hepatopancreatic ducts that conduct them into the shrimp hepatopancreas (HP), where further digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place. Although the GS function is well known, its exclusion limit for particulate material has not been clearly defined. Using histological and ultra-structure analysis, we show that the GS sieve pore diameter is approximately 0.2–0.7 µm in size, indicating a size exclusion limit of substantially less than 1 µm. Using fluorescent microbeads, we show that particles of 1 µm diameter could not pass through the GS but that particles of 0.1 µm diameter did pass through to accumulate in longitudinal grooves and move on to the HP, where some were internalized by tubule epithelial cells. We found no significant difference in these sizes between the species Penaeus monodon and Penaeus vannamei or between juveniles and adults in P. vannamei. This information will be of value for the design of particulate feed ingredients such as nutrients, therapeutic drugs and toxin-absorbing materials that may selectively target the stomach, intestine or HP of cultivated shrimp.","keywords":"Alimentary tract, Stomach, Penaeus monodon, Penaeus monodon, Penaeus vannamei, Penaeus vannamei, Fluorescent microbead, Sieve exclusion","title":"The gastric sieve of penaeid shrimp species is a sub-micrometer nutrient filter","authors":"Werawich Pattarayingsakul, Arnon Pudgerd, Natthinee Munkongwongsiri, Rapeepun Vanichviriyakit, Thawatchai Chaijarasphong, Siripong Thitamadee, Thanapong Kruangkum","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"17 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/10/jeb199638?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Temperature is an important environmental factor influencing fish physiology that varies both spatially and temporally in ecosystems. In small north-temperate lakes, cold water piscivores rely on nearshore prey; however, this region exceeds the optimal temperature of the foraging species during summer. To cope, piscivores make short excursions into the nearshore to feed and return to cold water to digest, but the physiological impacts of these repeated acute exposures to warm water are not well understood. We exposed juvenile lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to treatments where they were held at ≈10°C and exposed to either 17 or 22°C for 5 - 10 min daily for 53 days mimicking warm-water forays. Control fish, held at an average temperature of ≈10°C but not exposed to thermal variation, consumed more food and grew slightly faster than heat challenged fish, with no clear differences in body condition, hepatosomatic index, ventricle mass, or muscle concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase. Aerobic metabolic rates measured at 10°C indicated that standard metabolic rates (SMR) were similar among treatments; however, fish that were repeatedly exposed to 17°C had higher maximum metabolic rates (MMR) and aerobic scopes (AS) than control fish and those repeatedly exposed to 22°C. There were no differences in MMR or AS between fish exposed to 22°C and control fish. These results suggest that although SMR of fish are robust to repeated forays into warmer environments, MMR displays plasticity, allowing fish to be less constrained aerobically in cold water after briefly occupying warmer waters.","keywords":"Metabolic rate, Aerobic scope, Behavioural thermoregulation, Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), Salvelinus namaycush, Physiology, Temperature, Climate Change","title":"Effects of repeated daily acute heat challenge on the growth and metabolism of a cold-water stenothermal fish","authors":"Matthew M.

Here we studied flea (Oropsylla idahoensis and Oropsylla opisocroistis tuberculata) parasitism on a natural population of Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus; CGS) in Sheep River Provincial Park, Alberta. Fleas were experimentally added to adult female CGS at physiologically demanding times, including birth, lactation, and weaning of their young. The body mass of adult females, as well as their oxidative stress and immunity were recorded multiple times over the CGS active season under flea-augmented and control conditions. We also measured the prevalence of an internal parasite (Trypanosoma otospermophili). Doubly labelled water (DLW) was interperitoneally injected at peak lactation to examine energy expenditure. Effects of parasites on oxidative stress were only observed after offspring were weaned. There was no direct effect of experimentally heightened flea prevalence on energy use. A short-term 24 h mass loss (-17 g) was detected briefly after parasite addition, likely due to CGS preferentially allocating time for grooming. Our parasite augmentation did not strongly affect hosts and suggested that short-term physiological effects were unlikely to culminate in long term fitness consequences. Columbian ground squirrels appear to rapidly manage parasite costs, probably through grooming.","keywords":"Parasitism, Immune cost, Columbian ground squirrel, Flea, Energy expenditure, Oxidative stress","title":"Subtle short-term physiological costs of an experimental augmentation of fleas in wild Columbian ground squirrels","authors":"Jeffrey D.

The eversible vesicles are their unique paired transporting organs, which consist of an epithelium located inside a tube-like structure called the collophore on the first abdominal segment. The vesicles can be protruded out of the collophore and several lines of evidence indicate that they have a vital function in water uptake and ion balance. However, the amount of water absorbed by the vesicles and which other ions apart from Na+ are transported remain unknown. Using Orchesella cincta as a model, we developed protocols for two assays that enabled us to study water and ion movement across the eversible vesicles in whole living springtails. Using an inverse Ramsay assay we demonstrate that the eversible vesicles absorb water from a droplet applied onto their surface. Using the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET), we show that the vesicles absorb Na+ and Cl− from the bathing medium, secrete NH4+, and both absorb and secrete K+. H+ is secreted at a low level in the anterior part and absorbed at the posterior part. We did not detect transport of Ca2+ at significant levels. The highest flux was the absorption of Cl−, and the magnitude of ion fluxes was significantly lower in fully hydrated springtails.

However, larger ants were captured carrying leaf fragments that represented a lower proportion of their body mass compared to their smaller counterparts. Therefore, when selecting leaves, larger ants retained a higher proportion of their load carrying capacity in reserve.

However, ITD are in the sub-millisecond range for most animals. Because the neural processing of such small ITDs pushes the limit of temporal resolution, the precise ITD-range for a given species and its usefulness - relative to other localization cues - was a powerful selective force in the evolution of the neural circuits involved. Birds and other non-mammals have internally coupled middle ears working as pressure-difference receivers that may significantly enhance ITD, depending on the precise properties of the interaural connection. Here, the extent of this internal coupling was investigated in chickens, specifically under the same experimental conditions as typically used in neurophysiology of ITD-coding circuits, i.e. with headphone stimulation and skull openings. Cochlear microphonics (CM) were recorded simultaneously from both ears of anesthetized chickens under monaural and binaural stimulation, using pure tones from 0.1 to 3 kHz. Interaural transmission peaked at 1.5 kHz at a loss of only −5.5 dB; the mean interaural delay was 264 µs. CM amplitude strongly modulated as a function of ITD, confirming significant interaural coupling. The “ITD heard” derived from the CM phases in both ears showed enhancement, compared to the acoustic stimuli, by a factor of up to 1.8. However, the experimental conditions impaired interaural transmission at low frequencies (< 1 kHz). We identify factors that need to be considered when interpreting neurophysiological data obtained under these conditions, and relating them to the natural free-field condition.","keywords":"Auditory, Hearing, Sound localization, Bird, Avian, ITD","title":"Internally coupled middle ears enhance the range of interaural time differences heard by the chicken","authors":"Christine Köppl","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"28 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.199232v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Insect pheromones are often derived from fatty acid metabolism. Fatty acid desaturases, enzymes introducing double bonds into fatty acids, are crucial for the biosynthesis of these chemical signals. Δ12-desaturases catalyse the biosynthesis of linoleic acid by introducing a second double bond into oleic acid, but have been identified in only a few animal species. Here, we report the functional characterisation of two Δ12-desaturases, Nvit_D12a and Nvit_D12b, from the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis. We demonstrate that Nvit_D12a is expressed in the rectal vesicle of males where they produce a linoleic acid-derived sex pheromone to attract virgin females. 13C-labelling experiments with Urolepis rufipes, a closely related species belonging to the ‘Nasonia group’, revealed that females, but not males, are able to synthesise linoleic acid. U. rufipes males produce an isoprenoid sex pheromone in the same gland and do not depend on linoleic acid for pheromone production. This suggests that Δ12-desaturases are common in the ‘Nasonia group’, but acquired a specialised function in chemical communication of those species that use linoleic acid as a pheromone precursor. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that insect Δ12-desaturases have evolved repeatedly from Δ9-desaturases in different insect taxa. Hence, insects have developed a way to produce linoleic acid independent of the omega desaturase subfamily which harbours all of the eukaryotic Δ12-desaturases known so far.","keywords":"Parasitic wasp, Δ12-desaturase, Sex pheromone, Biosynthesis, Nasonia vitripennis, Nasonia vitripennis, Urolepis rufipes, Urolepis rufipes","title":"Functional characterisation of two Δ12-desaturases demonstrates targeted production of linoleic acid as pheromone precursor in Nasonia","authors":"Florian Semmelmann, Naoki Kabeya, Miriama Malcicka, Astrid Bruckmann, Bastian Broschwitz, Kristina Straub, Rainer Merkl, Oscar Monroig, Reinhard Sterner, Joachim Ruther, Jacintha Ellers","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"16 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/10/jeb201038?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Absorption of excessive light by photosymbiotic organisms leads to the production of reactive oxygen species that can damage both symbiont and host.

Therefore, the metabolic demands of visual systems make them highly sensitive to fluctuations in available oxygen. In the marine environment, oxygen changes over daily, seasonal and inter-annual time scales, and there are large gradients of oxygen with depth. Vision is linked to survival in many marine animals, particularly among the crustaceans, cephalopods and fish, and early life stages of these groups rely on vision for prey capture, predator detection and their distribution in the water column. Using in vivo electroretinogram recordings, we show that there is a decrease in retinal sensitivity to light in marine invertebrates when exposed to reduced oxygen availability. We found a 60–100% reduction in retinal responses in the larvae of cephalopods and crustaceans: the market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), the two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculatus), the tuna crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) and the graceful rock crab (Metacarcinus gracilis). A decline in oxygen also decreases the temporal resolution of vision in D. opalescens. These results are the first demonstration that vision in marine invertebrates is highly sensitive to oxygen availability and that the thresholds for visual impairment from reduced oxygen are species-specific. Oxygen-impaired retinal function may change the visual behaviors crucial to survival in these marine larvae. These findings may impact our understanding of species’ vulnerability to ocean oxygen loss and suggest that researchers conducting electrophysiology experiments should monitor oxygen levels, as even small changes in oxygen may affect the results.","keywords":"Zooplankton, Phototransduction, Physiology, Electroretinogram, Hypoxia","title":"Vision is highly sensitive to oxygen availability in marine invertebrate larvae","authors":"Lillian R.

Photo credit: Lillian McCormick., Human brains don't do well without oxygen. When mountaineer Thomas Hornbein ascended Everest in 1963, he described his vision dimming when his oxygen regulator jarred loose. Fortunately, few of us experience hypoxia in such dramatic situations, but Lillian McCormick, from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, explains that many aquatic creatures routinely encounter potentially threatening oxygen levels. ‘In nearshore areas of the Pacific Ocean off southern California, organisms can be exposed to reduced oxygen even in 0–50 m depth,’ she says. And when she reviewed the literature, it was clear that species with complex eyes would be most at risk of visual impairment. However, she and her colleagues Lisa Levin and Nicholas Oesch noticed that little was known about the ill effects of hypoxia on the larvae of many of these species., To rectify the situation, McCormick went trawling for plankton. ‘I hand-sorted each tow to set aside the larvae that we were interested in’, says McCormick, who decided to test the vision of larvae of the two spot octopus (Octopus bimaculatus), the tuna crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) and the graceful rock crab (Metacarcinus gracilis). However, she had to wait for the first and new moons of each month, when the market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens) spawn, to collect freshly laid egg sacs, which she took back to the lab to wait for the youngsters to hatch. Then, she painstakingly inserted a minute electrode into the retina of each tiny larva to record the eye's responses to light. Gradually decreasing and then increasing the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the water, McCormick recorded the response of each larva's retina to 1 s flashes of light. And when the oxygen was at ∼21, ∼10 and ∼3%, she shone a series of increasingly dimmer 1 s flashes into their eyes. In addition, McCormick shone a flickering light that gradually speeded up until the flashes blurred into one into the eyes of the squid and tuna crab larvae to find out how well the tiny animals could see fast-moving objects as the oxygen dwindled., Shockingly, all of the larvae lost some or all of their vision as the oxygen declined, with the market squid and graceful rock crab larvae unexpectedly beginning to suffer vision loss as soon as the oxygen began dropping. In contrast, the light response of the two spot octopus and tuna crab larval retinas held out reasonably well until the oxygen fell to ∼13%. By the time the oxygen had dipped to ∼3%, most of the squid, octopus and graceful rock crab larvae had completely lost their vision, although the retinal response of the tuna crab larvae only dipped to 60%. And while the speed of the tuna crab larvae's vision barely faltered at the lower oxygen levels, the response time of the squid larvae's retina reduced significantly, suggesting that they may really struggle to see the fast-moving copepods, upon which they dine, when oxygen is scarce., ‘We calculate that the decline in retinal function due to decreased oxygen availability in larvae that move from 0 to 30 m depth in spring in southern California would be 15–59%’, says McCormick; which means that these minute creatures may already be experiencing visual loss in their natural environment. And she is concerned that additional declines in oxygen availability could place the larvae at further risk. ‘If larvae are unable to detect small changes in light intensity, or the swimming movements of their prey, they may not survive’, she warns.","keywords":"","title":"Marine larval vision suffers in low oxygen","authors":"Kathryn Knight","origin":"INSIDE JEB","pub_date":"13 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/10/jeb205534?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Insects use multiple sensory modalities when searching for and accepting a food source, in particular odor and taste cues.

Taste cues, in contrast, act directly by contact with the food source, promoting the ingestion of nutritious food and the avoidance of toxic substances. It is possible, however, that insects integrate information from these sensory modalities during the process of feeding itself. Here, using a simple feeding assay, we investigated whether odors modulate food consumption in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We found that the presence of both single food-derived odorants and complex odor mixtures enhanced consumption of an appetitive food. Feeding enhancement depended on the concentration and the chemical identity of the odorant. Volatile cues alone were sufficient to mediate this effect, as feeding was also increased when animals were prevented from contacting the odor source. Both males and females, including virgin females, increased ingestion in the presence of food-derived volatiles. Moreover, the presence of food-derived odorants significantly increased the consumption of food mixtures containing aversive bitter compounds, suggesting that flies integrate diverse olfactory and gustatory cues to guide feeding decisions, including situations in which animals are confronted with stimuli of opposite valence.

Over the past 20 years, individual growth rates of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) have declined, which may be a response to climate change; however, scarcity of physiological data makes it difficult to gauge the adaptive capacity and resilience of the species. We explored relationships between body condition and physiological parameters pertaining to oxygen (O2) storage capacity in 77 beluga whales in the eastern Beaufort Sea. Muscle myoglobin concentrations averaged 77.9 mg g−1, one of the highest values reported among mammals. Importantly, blood hematocrit, hemoglobin, and muscle myoglobin concentrations correlated positively to indices of body condition, including maximum half-girth to length ratios. Thus, a whale with the lowest body condition index would have ∼27% lower blood (26.0 vs. 35.7 mL kg−1) and 12% lower muscle (15.6 vs. 17.7 mL kg−1) O2 stores than a whale of equivalent mass with the highest body condition index; with the conservative assumption that underwater O2 consumption rates are unaffected by body condition, this equates to a >3 minute difference in maximal aerobic dive time between the two extremes (14.3 vs. 17.4 minutes). Consequently, environmental changes that negatively impact body condition may hinder the ability of whales to reach preferred prey sources, evade predators, and escape ice entrapments. The relationship between body condition and O2 storage capacity may represent a vicious cycle, in which environmental changes resulting in decreased body condition impair foraging, leading to further reductions in condition through diminished prey acquisition and/or increased foraging efforts.","keywords":"Arctic climate change, Body condition, Hemoglobin, Marine mammals, Myoglobin, Oxygen storage capacity","title":"Body condition impacts blood and muscle oxygen storage capacity of free-living beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas)","authors":"Emily S.

Amphibian and fish embryos have shown to acquire this information while at the embryonic stage of development, in relation to the developing nervous system and sensory development. Except for Daphnia, so far there is no information on chemically-mediated responses to alarm cues in embryos of other crustacean groups.

Embryonic exposure to chemical alarm cues from conspecifics shortened the embryonic developmental time and elicited larger larvae with longer rostrum. Rostrum length of the first larval instar changed independently of their size, thus elongated rostra can be considered a defensive feature. Embryonic developmental time was not altered by chemical alarm cues from either heterospecifics or the mixed cues treatments; however, embryonic exposure to those cues caused larger larvae compared to distilled water control. Chemically-induced morphological plasticity in larvae in response to con- and heterospecifics suggests that alarm cues are conserved in palaemonids shrimps, providing embryos with an innate recognition of heterospecific alarm cues as predicted by the phylogenetic relatedness hypothesis.","keywords":"Chemoreception, Embryo, Hatching, Induced defences, Macro-crustacean, Predation risk","title":"Chemically-induced plasticity in early life history of Palaemon argentinus: are chemical alarm cues conserved within palaemonid shrimps?","authors":"Romina B.

Here, mucosally-added guanylin (GN) increased HCO3− secretion, measured by pH-stat, across isolated seawater-acclimated eel intestine bathed in saline at pH 7.4 (5% CO2). The effect of GN on HCO3− secretion was slower than that on the short-circuit current, and the time-course of the GN effect was similar to that of bumetanide. Mucosal bumetanide and serosal 4,4’-dinitrostilbene-2,2’-disulfonic acid (DNDS) inhibited the GN effect, suggesting an involvement of apical Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC2) and basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (AE)/Na+-HCO3− cotransporter (NBC) in the GN effect. As mucosal DNDS failed to inhibit the GN effect, apical DNDS-sensitive AE may not be involved.

Our findings imply that these two temperate birds employ different muscular growth strategies that may be metabolically beneficial to each.","keywords":"Muscle ultrastructure, Fiber diameter, Capillary density, Myonuclear domain, Temperate resident birds","title":"Seasonal muscle ultrastructure plasticity and resistance of muscle structural changes during temperature increases in resident black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) and rock pigeons (Columba livia)","authors":"Ana Gabriela Jimenez, Erin S.

The first goal of this study was to evaluate the impacts of ocean acidification on calcified tube growth for two Serpulidae polychaete worms. Spirorbis sp. and Spirobranchus triqueter were collected at 11 m depth from the Northwest Mediterranean Sea and maintained for 30 and 90 d, at three mean pHT levels (total scale) of 8.1 (ambient), 7.7, and 7.4. Moderately decreased tube elongation rates were observed in both species at a pHT of 7.7 while severe reductions occurred at pHT 7.4. There was visual evidence of dissolution and tubes were more fragile at lower pH but, fragility was not attributed to changes in fracture toughness. Instead, it appeared to be due to the presence of larger alveoli covered in a thinner calcareous layer. The second objective of the study was to test for effects in offspring development of the species S. triqueter. Spawning was induced, and offspring were reared in the same pH conditions the parents experienced. Trochophore size was reduced at the lowest pH level but settlement success was similar across pH conditions. Post-settlement tube growth was most affected. At 38 d post-settlement, juvenile tubes at pHT of 7.7 and 7.4 were half the size of those at pHT 8.1. Results suggest future carbonate chemistry will negatively affect initiation and persistence of both biofouling and epiphytic polychaete tube worms.","keywords":"PH, Spirorbis sp., Spirorbis, Spirobranchus triqueter, Spirobranchus triqueter, Trans-generational effects, Tube worms","title":"Ocean acidification affects calcareous tube growth in adult stage and reared offspring of serpulid polychaetes","authors":"V.

However, conventional ṀO2 sampling intervals (5-20 min) tend to smooth any dynamic fluctuations in active ṀO2 (ṀO2active) and thus likely underestimate the peak ṀO2active. Here, we used rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to explore the dynamic nature of ṀO2active near Ucrit by using various sampling windows and an iterative algorithm. Compared with a conventional interval regression analysis of ṀO2active over a 10-min period, our new analytical approach generated a 23% higher peak ṀO2active. Therefore, we suggest that accounting for such dynamics in ṀO2active with this new analytical approach may lead to more accurate estimates of maximum ṀO2 in fishes.","keywords":"Dynamic oxygen uptake, Iterative algorithm, Swimming, Respirometry, Maximal exercise, Maximum rate of oxygen uptake","title":"Finding the peak of dynamic oxygen uptake during fatiguing exercise in fish","authors":"Yangfan Zhang, Matthew J.

Euryhaline elasmobranchs maintain high internal urea and ion levels even in FW environments, but little is known about the osmoregulatory mechanisms that enable them to maintain internal homeostasis in hypoosmotic environments. In the present study, we focused on the kidney because this is the only organ that can excrete excess water from the body in a hypoosmotic environment. We conducted a transfer experiment of bull sharks from SW to FW and performed differential gene expression analysis between the two conditions using RNA-seq. A search for genes up-regulated in the FW-acclimated bull shark kidney indicated that the expression of the Na+-Cl− cotransporter (NCC; Slc12a3) was ten times higher in the FW-acclimated fish compared to that in SW fish. In the kidney, apically-located NCC was observed in the late distal tubule and in the anterior half of collecting tubule where basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase was also expressed, implying that these segments contribute to NaCl reabsorption from the filtrate for diluting the urine. This expression pattern was not observed in the houndshark, Triakis scyllium, that had been transferred to 30% SW; this species cannot survive in FW environment. The salinity transfer experiment combined with a comprehensive gene screening approach demonstrates that NCC is a key renal protein that contributes to the remarkable euryhaline ability of the bull shark.","keywords":"Kidney, Ion transporters, Euryhalinity, Osmoregulation, Freshwater adaptation, Cartilaginous fish","title":"Comprehensive analysis of genes contributing to euryhalinity in the bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas; Na+-Cl− co-transporter is one of the key renal factors up-regulated in acclimation to low-salinity environment in bull sharks, but not in houndsharks, Triakis scyllium","authors":"Itaru Imaseki, Midori Wakabayashi, Yuichiro Hara, Taro Watanabe, Souichirou Takabe, Keigo Kakumura, Yuki Honda, Keiichi Ueda, Kiyomi Murakumo, Rui Matsumoto, Yosuke Matsumoto, Masaru Nakamura, Wataru Takagi, Shigehiro Kuraku, Susumu Hyodo","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"28 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.201780v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Poison frogs sequester small molecule lipophilic alkaloids from their diet of leaf litter arthropods for use as chemical defenses against predation. Although the dietary acquisition of chemical defenses in poison frogs is well-documented, the physiological mechanisms of alkaloid sequestration has not been investigated. Here, we used RNA sequencing and proteomics to determine how alkaloids impact mRNA or protein abundance in the Little Devil Frog (Oophaga sylvatica) and compared wild caught chemically defended frogs to laboratory frogs raised on an alkaloid-free diet. To understand how poison frogs move alkaloids from their diet to their skin granular glands, we focused on measuring gene expression in the intestines, skin, and liver. Across these tissues, we found many differentially expressed transcripts involved in small molecule transport and metabolism, as well as sodium channels and other ion pumps. We then used proteomic approaches to quantify plasma proteins, where we found several protein abundance differences between wild and laboratory frogs, including the amphibian neurotoxin binding protein saxiphilin. Finally, because many blood proteins are synthesized in the liver, we used thermal proteome profiling as an untargeted screen for soluble proteins that bind the alkaloid decahydroquinoline. Using this approach, we identified several candidate proteins that interact with this alkaloid, including saxiphilin. These transcript and protein abundance patterns suggest the presence of alkaloids influences frog physiology and that small molecule transport proteins may be involved in toxin bioaccumulation in dendrobatid poison frogs.","keywords":"Alkaloids, Sequestration, Chemical defense, Poison frogs, Dendrobatidae, RNA sequencing, Proteomics, Plasma","title":"Molecular physiology of chemical defenses in a poison frog","authors":"Stephanie N.

Infection by S. carpocapsae significantly upregulated Vg mRNA expression in the male body. The corresponding increase in Vg protein expression was also confirmed by electrophoretic and immunoblotting analyses. Remarkably, in females, the opposite tendency was noted. Nematodal infection significantly reduced both Vg mRNA and Vg protein expression levels in fat body and hemolymph, respectively. We speculate that infection of reproductive females reduces Vg expression to a level that is still sufficient for defense, but is insufficient for reproduction. This circumstance reduces energy expenditure and helps the individual to cope with the infection. Importantly, purified Vg significantly inhibited growth of Xenorhabdus spp., an entomotoxic bacteria isolated from S. carpocapsae. However, the effect of Vg against I. fumosorosea was not so obvious. The fungus significantly stimulated Vg gene expression in males; however, a similar increase was not recapitulated at the protein level. Nevertheless, in females, both mRNA and protein Vg levels were significantly reduced after the fungal infection. The obtained data demonstrate that Vg is probably an important defense protein, possibly with a specific activity. This considerably expands the known spectrum of Vg functions, as its primary role was thought to be limited to regulating egg development in the female body.","keywords":"Yolk protein, Immunity, Antibacterial activity, Antifungal activity, Entomopathogenic nematode, Entomopathogenic fungus","title":"Changes in vitellogenin expression caused by nematodal and fungal infections in insects","authors":"Dalibor Kodrík, Emad Ibrahim, Umesh K.

However, wing gaps inherent of this process can also reduce flight capacities, which could be detrimental when foraging or escaping predators. Still, many bird species will not cease their normal activities when molting. In this study, we investigated whether and how birds adjust their escape flight behavior to compensate for the reduction in performance when flying with wing gaps. Using stereoscopic high-speed videography, we filmed 146 upward-directed escape flights of 19 and 22 pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) with and without simulated molt gaps, respectively. We then reconstructed the three-dimensional body and wing movements throughout each maneuver. By comparing flights with and without gaps, we determined how wing molt gaps affected wing morphology and escape flight performance, and how the birds adjusted their flight kinematics in order to negate possible negative aerodynamic effects. Our manipulations resulted in a lower second moment of area of the wings, but flight speed and net aerodynamic force production did not differ between the two groups. We found that in manipulated birds, the size of the gap was reduced as the flight feathers adjacent to the gap had moved towards each other. Moreover, the experimental decrease in second moment of area was associated with an increase in angle of attack, whereas changes in wingbeat-induced speeds were associated with variations in aerodynamic force production. This suggests that the control of escape flight in molting birds might be modular, allowing relatively simple flight control, thus reducing the burden on the neuro-muscular flight control system.","keywords":"European pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, Ficedula hypoleuca, Avian flight, Wingbeat kinematics","title":"A songbird compensates for wing molt during escape flights by reducing the molt gap and increasing angle of attack","authors":"Barbara M.
