[{"origin":"Special Issue Editorial","abstract":"At a time of unprecedented human population growth, climate change, and losses in biodiversity, plant reproduction is a particularly strategic research topic. From the very moment that a sporophytic cell switches its developmental pathway to become the megasporocyte or microsporocyte until a seed is finally formed, an intricate network of tightly regulated signalling pathways is in action. In recent years our understanding of the plant reproductive system has evolved enormously, and at a great pace.

During this elegant process, subtle communication occurs between neighboring cells, based on chemical signals, that induces cellular mechanisms of patterning and growth. Having faced an immediate issue of self-incompatibility responses, the pathway to fertilization starts once the stigmatic cells recognize a compatible pollen grain, and it continues with numerous players interacting to affect pollen tube growth and the puzzling process of navigation along the transmitting tract. The pollen tube goes through a guidance process that begins with a preovular stage (i.e. prior to the influence of the target ovule), with interactions with factors from the transmitting tissue. In the subsequent ovular-guidance stage a specific relationship develops between the pollen tube and its target ovule. This stage is divided into the funicular and micropylar guidance steps, with numerous receptors working in signalling cascades. Finally, just after the pollen tube has passed beyond the synergids, fusion of the gametes occurs and the developing seed—the ultimate aim of the process—will start to mature. In this paper, we review the existing knowledge of the crucial biological processes involved in pollen–pistil interactions that give rise to the new seed.","authors":"Ana Lúcia Lopes, Diana Moreira, Maria João Ferreira, Ana Marta Pereira, Sílvia Coimbra","keywords":"Double fertilization, pollen–pistil interaction, pollen tube guidance, receptors, sexual plant reproduction, signalling molecules","pub_date":"01 March 2019","title":"Insights into secrets along the pollen tube pathway in need to be discovered","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/11/2979/5367579?rss=1"},{"origin":"Review Papers","abstract":"Plant domestication is the process of adapting plants to human use by selecting specific traits. The selection process often involves the modification of some components of the plant reproductive mechanisms. Allelic variants of genes associated with flowering time, vernalization, and the circadian clock are responsible for the adaptation of crops, such as rice, maize, barley, wheat, and tomato, to non-native latitudes. Modifications in the plant architecture and branching have been selected for higher yields and easier harvests. These phenotypes are often produced by alterations in the regulation of the transition of shoot apical meristems to inflorescences, and then to floral meristems. Floral homeotic mutants are responsible for popular double-flower phenotypes in Japanese cherries, roses, camellias, and lilies. The rise of peloric flowers in ornamentals such as snapdragon and florists’ gloxinia is associated with non-functional alleles that control the relative expansion of lateral and ventral petals. Mechanisms to force outcrossing such as self-incompatibility have been removed in some tree crops cultivars such as almonds and peaches. In this review, we revisit some of these important concepts from the plant domestication perspective, focusing on four topics related to the pre-fertilization mechanisms: flowering time, inflorescence architecture, flower development, and pre-fertilization self-incompatibility mechanisms.","authors":"Silvia Manrique, James Friel, Pietro Gramazio, Tomas Hasing, Ignacio Ezquer, Aureliano Bombarely","keywords":"Clonal propagation, domestication, flower development, flowering time, inflorescence architecture, self-incompatibility, sexual reproduction","pub_date":"01 June 2019","title":"Genetic insights into the modification of the pre-fertilization mechanisms during plant domestication","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/11/3007/5509875?rss=1"},{"origin":"Review Papers","abstract":"Fruits result from complex biological processes that begin soon after fertilization. Among these processes are cell division and expansion, accumulation of secondary metabolites, and an increase in carbohydrate biosynthesis. Later fruit ripening is accomplished by chlorophyll degradation and cell wall lysis. Fruit maturation is an essential step to optimize seed dispersal, and is controlled by a complex network of transcription factors and genetic regulators that are strongly influenced by phytohormones. Abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene are the major regulators of ripening and senescence in both dry and fleshy fruits, as demonstrated by numerous ripening-defective mutants, effects of exogenous hormone application, and transcriptome analyses. While ethylene is the best characterized player in the final step of a fruit’s life, ABA also has a key regulatory role, promoting ethylene production and acting as a stress-related hormone in response to drought and pathogen attack. In this review, we focus on the role of ABA and ethylene in relation to the interconnected biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect ripening and senescence. We integrate and discuss the most recent data available regarding these biological processes, which are crucial for post-harvest fruit conservation and for food safety.","authors":"Sara Forlani, Simona Masiero, Chiara Mizzotti","keywords":"Cell wall, climacteric fruit, dry fruit, fleshy fruit, hormones, non-climacteric fruit, pathogens, ripening, senescence","pub_date":"11 March 2019","title":"Fruit ripening: the role of hormones, cell wall modifications, and their relationship with pathogens","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/11/2993/5373027?rss=1"},{"origin":"Review Papers","abstract":"In angiosperms, there are two pathways of reproduction through seeds: sexual, or amphimictic, and asexual, or apomictic. The essential feature of apomixis is that an embryo in an ovule is formed autonomously. It may form from a cell of the nucellus or integuments in an otherwise sexual ovule, a process referred to as adventitious embryony. Alternatively, the embryo may form by parthenogenesis from an unreduced egg that forms in an unreduced embryo sac. The latter may form from an ameiotic megasporocyte, in which case it is referred to as diplospory, or from a cell of the nucellus or integument, in which case it is referred to as apospory. Progeny of apomictic plants are generally identical to the mother plant. Apomixis has been seen over the years as either a gain- or loss-of-function over sexuality, implying that the latter is the default condition. Here, we consider an additional point of view, that apomixis may be anciently polyphenic with sex and that both reproductive phenisms involve anciently canalized components of complex molecular processes. This polyphenism viewpoint suggests that apomixis fails to occur in obligately sexual eukaryotes because genetic or epigenetic modifications have silenced the primitive sex apomixis switch and/or disrupted molecular capacities for apomixis. In eukaryotes where sex and apomixis are clearly polyphenic, apomixis exponentially drives clonal fecundity during reproductively favorable conditions, while stress induces sex for stress-tolerant spore or egg formation. The latter often guarantees species survival during environmentally harsh seasons.","authors":"Emidio Albertini, Gianni Barcaccia, John G Carman, Fulvio Pupilli","keywords":"Apomeiosis, apomixis, eukaryogenesis, meiosis, origins of sex, parthenogenesis, plant reproduction","pub_date":"11 March 2019","title":"Did apomixis evolve from sex or was it the other way around?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/11/2951/5373086?rss=1"},{"origin":"Review Papers","abstract":"Female gametogenesis in flowering plants initiates in the ovule, where a single germline progenitor differentiates from a pool of somatic cells. Germline initiation is a fundamental prerequisite for seed development but is poorly understood at the molecular level due to the location of the cells deep within the flower. Studies in Arabidopsis have shown that regulators of germline development include transcription factors such as NOZZLE/SPOROCYTELESS and WUSCHEL, components of the RNA-dependent DNA methylation pathway such as ARGONAUTE9 and RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6, and phytohormones such as auxin and cytokinin. These factors accumulate in a range of cell types from where they establish an environment to support germline differentiation. Recent studies provide fresh insight into the transition from somatic to germline identity, linking chromatin regulators, cell cycle genes, and novel mobile signals, capitalizing on cell type-specific methodologies in both dicot and monocot models. These findings are providing unique molecular and compositional insight into the mechanistic basis and evolutionary conservation of female germline development in plants.","authors":"Jorge Lora, Xiujuan Yang, Mathew R Tucker","keywords":"Arabidopsis, differentiation, epigenetics, expansion, germline, megasporogenesis, ovule","pub_date":"07 May 2019","title":"Establishing a framework for female germline initiation in the plant ovule","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/11/2937/5486516?rss=1"},{"origin":"Review Papers","abstract":"Under stress, isolated microspores are reprogrammed in vitro towards embryogenesis, producing doubled haploid plants that are useful biotechnological tools in plant breeding as a source of new genetic variability, fixed in homozygous plants in only one generation. Stress-induced cell death and low rates of cell reprogramming are major factors that reduce yield. Knowledge gained in recent years has revealed that initiation and progression of microspore embryogenesis involve a complex network of factors, whose roles are not yet well understood. Here, I review recent findings on the determinant factors underlying stress-induced microspore embryogenesis, focusing on the role of autophagy, cell death, auxin, chromatin modifications, and the cell wall. Autophagy and cell death proteases are crucial players in the response to stress, while cell reprogramming and acquisition of totipotency are regulated by hormonal and epigenetic mechanisms. Auxin biosynthesis, transport, and action are required for microspore embryogenesis. Initial stages involve DNA hypomethylation, H3K9 demethylation, and H3/H4 acetylation. Cell wall remodelling, with pectin de-methylesterification and arabinogalactan protein expression, is necessary for embryo development. Recent reports show that treatments with small modulators of autophagy, proteases, and epigenetic marks reduce cell death and enhance embryogenesis initiation in several crops, opening up new possibilities for improving in vitro embryo production in breeding programmes.","authors":"Pilar S Testillano","keywords":"Autophagy, cell death, cell fate, cell totipotency, cell wall, differentiation, epigenetic marks, microspore embryogenesis, phytohormones, stress","pub_date":"08 February 2019","title":"Microspore embryogenesis: targeting the determinant factors of stress-induced cell reprogramming for crop improvement","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/11/2965/5310108?rss=1"}]
