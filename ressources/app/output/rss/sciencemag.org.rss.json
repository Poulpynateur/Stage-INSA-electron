[{"abstract":"Michelle Dardengo was the first patient enrolled in the first human trial of a promising new therapy against Huntington disease., By Meredith WadmanMay. 6, 2019 , 3:40 PM, The data behind the promising trial of a drug that blocks the production of a mutant protein that causes brain damage in people with Huntington disease—an inherited and ultimately fatal neurological disorder—were published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, giving an official imprimatur to news that first electrified the community of patients with the disease 17 months ago., The results, originally announced in December 2017, were published alongside an editorial that called the trial “pathbreaking.” The new paper reports that the drug, a short stretch of synthetic DNA called HTTRx that blocks the production of the mutant protein huntingtin, is safe in humans; no serious adverse events were reported by the 46 people who participated in the trial. (Last summer, Science wrote in depth about the first participant, Michelle Dardengo.), The results also provide details behind the source of excitement about the trial: that HTTRx reduced levels of huntingtin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that bathes the spinal cord—a proxy, it is hoped, for what is happening in the brain—by amounts that had reversed Huntington-like motor and cognitive symptoms in mice. And the reductions in the mutant protein in the CSF of patients were dose-dependent: Through a range of dosing levels, the bigger the dose, the more the reduction of the mutant protein., The authors report, however, that symptoms of the disease were generally unchanged when the data were considered for each of five patient groups that received different doses, and “no meaningful differences were observed between patients who received placebo and patients who received HTTRx, regardless of the dose level.”, Now, all eyes are on a pivotal clinical trial that aims to enroll 660 people with Huntington disease. The first patient was enrolled in January, and the last patient data are expected to be collected in March 2022. Large enough and long enough to allow scientists to measure the drug’s impact on symptoms of the slowly progressive disease, the study should show whether the drug can deliver on its promise of slowing or stopping the course of the devastating disease., Running the key trial is Roche of Basel, Switzerland, which licensed HTTRx from its developer, Ionis Pharmaceuticals of Carlsbad, California, in December 2017, and renamed it RG6042.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/Michelle2_16x9.jpg?itok=eRlQrh9S","title":"Experimental Huntington disease drug reduces toxic protein, newly published data confirm","authors":"Meredith Wadman","pub_date":"May. 6, 2019 , 3:40 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/experimental-huntington-disease-drug-reduces-toxic-protein-newly-published-data-confirm"},{"abstract":"By Michael PriceMay. 6, 2019 , 3:00 PM, The 15 men, women, and children discovered in a 5000-year-old mass grave near the southern Polish village of Koszyce must have suffered brutal deaths: Each was killed by blows to the head. Yet the tidy, systematic nature of their burial suggests they were laid to rest with care. Now, new genetic analyses reveal the dead all belonged to a single extended family, offering an intimate glimpse of a Bronze Age tragedy., To discover their identities, a team of geneticists sequenced the genomes of all 15 skeletons. Once it was clear the individuals were closely related, scientists looked at their burial positions. They found that mothers were buried next to their children, and siblings were placed next to one another. Fathers and other older male relatives were conspicuously missing from the group, the researchers report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences., The dead belonged to the central European Globular Amphora culture—named for the bulbous pottery vessels included in graves—and were neighbors to the demographically distinct Corded Ware culture. Little is known about the interactions between those two groups, but some researchers speculate that as the Corded Ware culture expanded throughout Europe, competition for resources often boiled over into violence. One of those deadly outbreaks may have led to the killings of those in the Koszyce mass grave., But although the cause of the massacre isn’t known, it appears that the family’s elder men escaped—and therefore, the scientists say, may have been the ones to bury their dearly departed.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/mass%20grave_16x9.jpg?itok=vSAwohBz","title":"This 5000-year-old mass grave hides a family tragedy","authors":"Michael Price","pub_date":"May. 6, 2019 , 3:00 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/5000-year-old-mass-grave-hides-family-tragedy"},{"abstract":"German research minister Anja Karliczek helped negotiate a budget deal with steady rises for science., By Gretchen VogelMay. 3, 2019 , 12:20 PM, BERLIN—German research organizations cheered a decision announced today by state and federal ministers to increase research budgets by 3% a year for the next decade—a total boost of €17 billion over that time. For more than a decade, German research organizations have enjoyed consistent budget increases—3% boosts every year since 2006, even during downturns in the German economy. But some observers have worried that falling tax revenues and deep disagreements between state and federal ministers could bring an end to the largesse., The news turned out much better than most expected. Not only will the research organizations—including the Max Planck Society and the grantmaking agency the German Research Foundation—get their increases, universities and technical schools will also receive significant boosts through 2027. “It’s a huge relief,” says Matthias Kleiner, president of the country’s Leibniz Association here, which includes more than 90 research institutes. The agreement is “an extraordinarily positive and encouraging signal for science.”, The deal also approves two new Max Planck institutes: the Institute for Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection, to be based in Bochum, and a new independent Institute for the Biology of Behavior in Radolfzell, previously part of the Institute for Ornithology. The Leibniz Association will also add two institutes: The German Resilience Center in Mainz will study factors that keep people healthy even under stressful conditions and the Center for Sustainable Architecture for Finance in Europe in Frankfurt will study the effects of political decisions on finance markets., Negotiations centered on who—the federal or state government—should shoulder the increases. Since 2014, the federal government has covered the budget increases, skewing traditional cost-sharing formulas between the federal and state governments. The funding of Max Planck institutes traditionally is split 50-50 between the state and federal government, for example, whereas Leibnitz institutes are funded 90% by states., The federal government’s insistence that the states return to covering their full share was a threat to the 3% yearly boosts. Instead, the ministers agreed to keep the budgets growing and to spread out the rebalancing process over a 10-year agreement instead of the usual 5 years. The federal government will cover most of the increases through 2023, and the states will increase their share from 2024 through 2030., In return, the research organizations will undergo more yearly evaluations—and a full evaluation in 5 years. That doesn’t mean the increases are in jeopardy, Federal Minister of Education and Research Anja Karliczek said here at a press conference. “It will be a chance to make sure the organizations are on track to meet the goals they set—and refocus if necessary,” she says. Kleiner welcomes the evaluations. “We have to accept that we can show we are using the money wisely.”, In recent weeks Karliczek has been the target of criticism, with commentators predicting she would be one of the first ministers to go if Chancellor Angela Merkel reshuffles her cabinet, as is expected following European elections in late May. But the agreement could silence some of those critics. “It’s a brilliant coup” for the minister, Kleiner says., Merkel and state leaders are expected to give final approval to the plan on 6 June.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/germany_16x9_0.jpg?itok=msj1BqaE","title":"German research promised a decade of budget increases","authors":"Gretchen Vogel","pub_date":"May. 3, 2019 , 12:20 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/german-research-promised-decade-budget-increases"},{"abstract":"Researchers discovered the mind-altering kit in the Cueva del Chileno rock shelter, high in the Bolivian Andes., By Michael PriceMay. 6, 2019 , 3:00 PM, When José Capriles arrived in 2008 at the Cueva del Chileno rock shelter, nestled on the western slopes of Bolivia’s Andes, he didn’t know what he would find within. Sweeping aside layers of fresh and ancient llama dung, he found the remains of an ancient burial site: stone markers suggesting a body had once been interred there and a small leather bag cinched with a string. Inside was a collection of ancient drug paraphernalia—bone spatulas to crush the seeds of plants with psychoactive compounds, wooden tablets inlaid with gemstones to serve as a crushing surface, a wooden snuffing tube with a carved humanoid figure, and a small pouch stitched together from the snouts of three foxes., Now, more than a decade later, Capriles—an anthropologist at Pennsylvania State University in State College—and colleagues have discovered that the 1000-year-old bag contains the most varied combination of psychoactive compounds found at a South American site, including cocaine and the primary ingredients in a hallucinogenic tea called ayahuasca. The contents suggest the users were well versed in the psychoactive properties of the substances, and also that they sourced their goods from well-established trade routes., “Whoever had this bag of amazing goodies … would have had to travel great distances to acquire those plants,” says Melanie Miller, lead author of a new study on the discovery and a bioarchaeologist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. “[Either that], or they had really extensive exchange networks.”, Nearly every culture on Earth has dabbled with consciousness- and perception-altering substances. Indigenous groups from Central and South America have used hallucinogens such as peyote and psilocybin mushrooms during rituals and religious ceremonies for thousands of years. Archaeologists have uncovered hundreds of items that provide a glimpse into these ancient practices, but few are as complete as the Bolivian find., A pouch containing psychoactive compounds was stitched together from the snouts of three Andean foxes., In 2010, Miller joined the team to help chemically analyze the items, which had been nearly perfectly preserved in the arid conditions of the 4000-meter-high mountains. Radiocarbon dating revealed that the outer bag was made around 1000 C.E. Next, Miller carefully unwound the fox snout pouch and emptied its dust and debris onto a piece of aluminum foil. Using a technique frequently used in modern illicit drug testing called liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, she and her fellow researchers hunted for chemical signatures in the sample. They identified at least five psychoactive substances: cocaine, benzoylecgonine, bufotenine, harmine, and dimethyltryptamine., Harmine and dimethyltryptamine are the main ingredients in ayahuasca, used ceremonially for centuries by indigenous South Americans. Miller says their presence alongside the snuffing tube and tablet may mean that people inhaled these chemicals long before they were brewed into a beverage., A snuffing tube was used to inhale ground-up plant matter with psychoactive compounds., The mixture’s origins also offer clues to the trade routes of the people who occupied the high plains. Several of the compounds come from the plant genus Anadenanthera—also known as vilca, cebil, or yopo—which grows widely through South America, but not in this region of the Andes. Similarly, the likely source of the harmine is a lowland Amazonian species., Miller says it’s possible that the mixture of compounds was unique to the region. The fact that at least two of the ingredients are known to be used in tandem in ayahuasca raises the possibility that this shaman was selecting plant combinations for specific mind-altering effects, they report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “Maybe they were mixing multiple things together because they realized when they’re combined, they have a whole different set of experiences,” Miller says., When indigenous South Americans began to brew ayahuasca is still a major mystery, says Christine VanPool, an anthropologist at the University of Missouri in Columbia who wasn’t involved in the work. She’s intrigued by the idea they may first have discovered its properties by inhaling its key compounds. Shamans “say they’ve had [ayahuasca] for a very long time. So in some ways, I wasn’t surprised,” she says. But because archaeological evidence has been lacking, the new find is “exciting.”","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/cave%20main_16x9.jpg?itok=SBfQwegc","title":"Archaeologists find richest cache of ancient mind-altering drugs in South America","authors":"Michael Price","pub_date":"May. 6, 2019 , 3:00 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/archaeologists-find-richest-cache-ancient-mind-altering-drugs-south-america"},{"abstract":"By Alex FoxMay. 3, 2019 , 1:20 PM, Researchers may have an antidote for the deadliest jellyfish sting on Earth, The sting of a box jellyfish can kill a person in minutes.

A new study may have the answer—and a potential antidote., Meet the blue crew, scientists trying to give food, flowers, and more a color rarely found in nature, The quest for blue pigments—whose complex chemistry makes them rare in nature and difficult to synthesize—dates back millennia. Most were discovered by accident or are merely synthetic versions of blues already found in nature. In 2009, a chemist stumbled on the first new inorganic blue pigment in 200 years. Today, other researchers are continuing that quest by methodically using physics, chemistry, and genetics to create new blues to dazzle us with., Imported wolves settle in as Lake Superior island teems with moose, Thirteen new radio-collared wolves are now scouting Isle Royale in Michigan and feasting on moose, whose numbers this winter reached 2060—the second highest estimate since ecologists began to study predators and prey on the island in 1958. The new wolves, imported to help restore the U.S. national park from overbrowsing by moose, are largely avoiding the territory of the remaining two wolves of the original Isle Royale population. Twenty female moose are also sporting radio collars, allowing biologists to watch both wolf and moose movements online., This shrimplike creature makes aluminum armor to survive the deep sea’s crushing pressure, Amphipods—small, shrimplike crustaceans in most aquatic ecosystems—start to fall apart once they hit depths of 4500 meters. There, a combination of crushing pressures, low temperature, and higher acidity causes the calcium carbonate in their exoskeletons to dissolve, making them vulnerable to pressure and predators. Now, scientists have discovered how one species, Hirondellea gigas, can survive in the deepest part of the ocean: with aluminum suits of armor., Neanderthals may have trapped golden eagles 130,000 years ago, The golden eagle has been hunted and revered by human cultures for thousands of years. Yet this may not have been a uniquely human devotion—Neanderthals, too, may have targeted these impressive birds of prey some 130,000 years ago, according to new research.

But the hope is that the bleak assessment—crafted by hundreds of scientists and historic in its depth and breadth—will finally persuade governments and others of the need to change course and prevent further harm to the ecological systems that provide for human well-being. “What’s at stake here is a liveable world,” says Robert Watson of the University of East Anglia in Norwich, U.K., who chaired the organization that produced the report., Only transformative changes to economic, political, and social systems will allow nations to meet agreed targets for nature conservation, the authors conclude. The core message is “quite radical,” says Georgina Mace, an ecologist at University College London who reviewed the assessment. “You have to prioritize nature and nature’s benefits to people in everything you do.”, The report confirms “that we can’t just preserve, we must reverse the trend by increasing biodiversity locally, regionally, and globally,” said Alexandre Antonelli, director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in the United Kingdom, in a statement., The report comes from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), based in Bonn, Germany, which includes representatives from more than 100 countries. More than 450 experts from around the world were involved in drafting the 1800-page report over 3 years. They reviewed some 15,000 scientific papers and other sources of data on trends in biodiversity and its ability to provide what are known as ecosystem services or nature’s contributions to people: everything from food and fiber to clean water and air., Many species are declining, the report notes. Out of 8 million known species of animals and plants, about 1 million are under threat of extinction, including more than 40% of amphibian species and a third of marine mammals. Even more are declining in numbers: Since 1900, native species have become, on average, about 20% less abundant. Measures of the extent and condition of natural ecosystems have declined 47% since the earliest estimates and many are deteriorating by 4% every decade., The report highlights other metrics of the decline of nature and its human domination. They include:, “The message is unfortunately very alarming,” says Hesiquio Benitez of the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity in Mexico City, a national delegate who voted to approve the report. “We’re reaching the limits of the planet.”, For the first time at a global scale, the report has ranked the causes of damage. Topping the list, changes in land use—principally agriculture—that have destroyed habitat. Second, hunting and other kinds of exploitation. These are followed by climate change, pollution, and invasive species, which are being spread by trade and other activities. Climate change will likely overtake the other threats in the next decades, the authors note. Driving these threats are the growing human population, which has doubled since 1970 to 7.6 billion, and consumption. (Per capita of use of materials is up 15% over the past 5 decades.) The report also includes perspectives from indigenous and local communities to a greater extent than before. Lands managed by indigenous peoples are declining less quickly than elsewhere, but 72% of indicators developed by such communities show deterioration of nature., There are a few bright spots, mostly the increasing creation of nature reserves and marine protected areas. But the progress is not nearly enough to meet most of the international conservation targets that nations set in the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010. The declining state of nature also jeopardizes efforts to meet many of the United Nations’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as ending hunger. “If we continue with business as usual, we’ll miss [the goals],” Mace says. “We’re quite good at making plans, and quite good at setting aside protected areas, but the response of the natural world is nothing like good enough to meet the targets.”, The new report is the first global analysis of the state of nature since 2005, when researchers assembled what is known as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. But the hope is that the IPBES report will have a greater impact than that study. The new report “is significant, because it’s the first global assessment that has been asked for by governments—they’ve been involved in it, they’ve shaped it,” says Peter Bridgewater, a biodiversity policy expert and adjunct at the University of Canberra, who was not involved in the report. Delegates from member nations approved the report on Saturday, after a week negotiating the text of the 40-page summary for policymakers., According to scenarios included in the report that examine the consequences of various possible policy decisions to 2050, the news will keep getting worse unless transformative change occurs. That change would involve undertaking a wide array of activities, the authors write, including land restoration, more widespread adoption of agroecological practices such as preventing soil erosion, and more widely enforced limits on fishing. Fundamentally, reversing the trends will require a shift to a more sustainable global economy, the authors state, and “steering away from the current limited paradigm of economic growth.”, In its call for transformation, the report anticipates pushback: “By its very nature, transformative change can expect opposition from those with interests vested in the status quo, but such opposition can be overcome for the broader public good.” IPBES will examine how to achieve such transformative change as part of its next round of work, notes Esther Turnhout, a science policy expert at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. The goal, she says, would be to better understand “how we can tackle those challenges and why we haven’t done so.”, Anne Larigauderie, executive secretary of IPBES, is optimistic the global report released today will make a difference. “The moment for biodiversity has arrived,” she says, pointing to growing initiatives and interest in protecting nature. “There is so much evidence, and the scientific community is speaking with one voice,” Larigauderie says. “Now it’s not something that can be ignored.”","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/rhino_16x9.jpg?itok=nZVRSlij","title":"Landmark analysis documents the alarming global decline of nature","authors":"Erik Stokstad","pub_date":"May. 6, 2019 , 5:55 AM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/landmark-analysis-documents-alarming-global-decline-nature"},{"abstract":"By David AdamMay. 3, 2019 , 8:00 AM, An attempt to make Yosemite National Park’s famed 2700-meter-high Half Dome rock formation safer for hikers appears to have backfired., In 2010, the California park began to issue permits through a random lottery to visitors interested in scaling Half Dome (pictured). It cited overcrowding for its decision; in the decade before, seven people died on the formation, including several who slipped and fell. Media attention focused on the way hikers had to queue and bunch together as they used metal handrails that are drilled into the rock to help people up the final, steepest section. The park hoped the permitting would limit the number of climbers crowded together on the rails at the top, and thus improve safety., But the permitting appears to have made matters worse, according to a study in press at Wilderness & Environmental Medicine. When researchers analyzed search-and-rescue data on and around Half Dome from 2005 to 2015, they found no significant difference in deaths and injuries after Yosemite began to issue permits. But because the permitting halved the number of visitors who hike the trail, the number of serious incidents per person effectively doubled., The permits may encourage visitors to take risks, including to keep going if they feel unwell, as they know they might not get another permit—and thus another chance to reach the top, the team speculates. Or the widespread publicity of the permitting process may attract people who are unfit or inexperienced.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/half%20dome_16x9.jpg?itok=P9WG73ZN","title":"Permits were supposed to make climbing Yosemite’s Half Dome safer.

Gene therapy is helping some patients breathe without a ventilator., By Jocelyn KaiserMay. 2, 2019 , 5:20 PM, WASHINGTON, D.C.—A new gene therapy treatment has had striking results in nine boys born with myotubular myopathy (MTM), a rare disease that causes extreme muscle weakness often from birth. All of the boys have better neuromuscular function, most can sit on their own, and four are now breathing without ventilators. As videos of their improvements were shown here on 1 May at the annual meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT), the audience broke out in applause. The results, the first of their kind for this rare disease, cap a year of early signs of success in using gene therapy for inherited muscle diseases., As far as muscle function is concerned, the boys “have gone from nothing to something,” says principal investigator Perry Shieh, a neurologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Time will tell how much that something will be.”, The patients in the new study have X-linked MTM, caused by a defect in a gene called MTM1 that encodes an enzyme, myotubularin. Skeletal muscles need the enzyme to develop and function. Boys with the disease have low muscle tone and, in many cases, can barely breathe or move on their own; most require a ventilator and feeding tube. Half of patients die by 18 months, and few live past age 10., In the trial, sponsored by Audentes Therapeutics, a gene therapy company in San Francisco, California, nine boys between 8 months and 6 years old with X-linked MTM received an intravenous (IV) infusion of many trillions of particles of a harmless virus, called an adeno-associated virus. The viruses were designed to carry a good copy of the MTM1 gene into the boys’ muscle cells. The gene, a free-floating piece of DNA, could then trigger the cell’s proteinmaking machinery to produce myotubularin. Three patients had serious side effects that may have been related to the therapy, such as heart inflammation, but all were treatable., Biopsies showed that 48 weeks after the first six boys received treatment, their leg muscle cells that previously had virtually no myotubularin were making, on average, 85% of the normal amount, Shieh reported yesterday. The boys’ abnormally small muscle fibers had grown larger. Four can now sit up without help, and three are taking steps with assistance; although still receiving nutrition through a feeding tube, several have started to eat food. And some can vocalize sounds for the first time, Shieh says., In one set of before-and-after videos, a 1-year-old boy lay passively on an examining table; 48 weeks after his treatment, he could stand and take steps with help. In another, a child who wobbled and needed help to sit up later sat alone and reached out to grab a toy. Three children treated with a higher dose are showing similar motor function gains after 6 months, along with faster changes in their muscle cells and up to double the amount of myotubularin that a healthy child’s cells make, Shieh reported., “They’re getting great results,” says gene therapy researcher and ASGCT president Michele Calos of Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who chaired a symposium of the meeting’s top abstracts, where Shieh presented. And in theory, those results could last: Because muscle cells don’t normally divide, the extra myotubularin could keep the boys’ muscles working for years to come. Dogs with a milder form of MTM that received the same therapy and gained the ability to run are still doing fine years later, Shieh notes., The treatment will be tested in more children before Audentes seeks approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Meanwhile, another IV gene therapy, for a rare genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy that led to dramatic improvements in 15 children is expected to soon become the second FDA-approved gene therapy for an inherited disorder. (The first was gene therapy for an inherited form of blindness in late 2017.), In the past year, experimental IV gene therapy from the biotech company Sarepta Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has also helped four boys born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy gain muscle strength—they can now more easily climb stairs, for example. And 60 days after a similar treatment, patients with a disease called limb-girdle muscular dystrophy are making substantial amounts of a missing muscle protein, Sarepta recently reported. To see such treatments finally helping patients is “surreal,” says Louise Rodino-Klapac, who spent her career developing these therapies in the lab at Ohio State University and Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus before joining Sarepta last year to head its gene therapy unit., These and other successes have helped spur an explosion of interest in the field. The ASGCT meeting, which for years attracted about 2000 attendees, drew more than 4800 this year, forcing the hotel hosting the meeting to turn people away from packed rooms and set up tents for some sessions. Many of the new attendees were from biotech companies. That’s a signal, says Calos, that after overcoming early obstacles, gene therapy is now “maturing as a branch of medicine.” From now on, she adds, the meeting will take place at larger venues.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/MTM_16x9.jpg?itok=jbxQWHSI","title":"Boys with a rare muscle disease are breathing on their own, thanks to gene therapy","authors":"Jocelyn Kaiser","pub_date":"May. 2, 2019 , 5:20 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/boys-rare-muscle-disease-are-breathing-their-own-thanks-gene-therapy"},{"abstract":"A lawsuit targets a global health institute and the dean of the Icahn School of Medicine in New York City, which is part of the Mount Sinai Health System., By Meredith WadmanMay. 2, 2019 , 3:05 PM, Seven current and former female employees have sued officials at a global health institute that is part of the Mount Sinai Health System’s Icahn School of Medicine in New York City, claiming age and sex discrimination. They claim the medical school’s dean, Dennis Charney, hired an underqualified man to direct the center, and allege that the director then drove out women who were in their 40s and older and preferentially hired younger men. An eighth plaintiff on the lawsuit, a man, claims discrimination based on race, religion, and national origin., The 174-page lawsuit, filed on 26 April, names as defendants Charney and three men at the Arnhold Institute for Global Health (AIGH), which designs technology and systems to improve the health of poor communities. It makes a number of allegations against center Director Prabhjot Singh, who was hired in 2015, including that he disparaged, demoted, and marginalized female employees; lied to funders about the status of a software project; and did not seek required ethics reviews for some research projects., The plaintiffs also allege that Singh countenanced abuse of female employees by David Berman, who was Singh’s chief of staff at the time, and Bruno Silva, the institute’s director of design and product development. Silva, the lawsuit alleges, called female co-workers and donors “bitches” and “c---s,” and that Singh “did nothing to curb him.” Berman “was known for violent screaming at women … which Singh nonchalantly ignored,” the lawsuit alleges., Berman, who could not be reached for comment, left the institute last summer. The Icahn School of Medicine declined to make Charney, and the two other defendants who still work at AIGH, available for interviews. The medical school said it does not comment on pending litigation but stated that: “We deny the allegations of discrimination … [and] expect to vigorously defend the action.” It also noted that, “Consistent with the School of Medicine’s longstanding commitment to equity and inclusion, when employees in the Institute for Global Health brought concerns to our attention last year, we promptly initiated an internal review after which appropriate steps were taken.”, The lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that the internal review, which was prompted by a complaint from some of the plaintiffs and other employees, was insufficient, as were the resulting actions. And it paints an unflattering picture of Charney, a prominent neurobiologist and psychiatrist. It depicts him driving away a senior woman who had been chosen by a search committee to lead AIGH, and instead hiring Singh, who was 32 years old at the time., Singh has a medical degree from Cornell University and a doctorate in neural and genetic systems from Rockefeller University in New York City. He was a visiting assistant professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University from 2011 to 2015 and was a staff associate and then a postdoctoral scientist at Columbia’s Earth Institute from 2007 to 2011., The lawsuit alleges that Singh wanted to remake AIGH into a Silicon Valley–like startup with a “bro culture” dominated by young men. “Dr. Singh directly [hired] largely younger, male friends and contacts, despite their lack of experience in global health,” states a press release issued by McAllister Olivarius, a law firm in Saratoga Springs, New York, that is representing the plaintiffs. “He disbanded the Institute’s Advisory Board, an important source of fundraising, because he considered its members ‘ladies who lunch.’”, The plaintiffs include Holly Atkinson, 66, a physician and former medical journalist who built and directed the human rights program at AIGH. The lawsuit states that in 2015, Singh demoted Atkinson from her director position, began to assign her tasks such as maintaining a Mailchimp list, and told her she would have to take a pay cut of $60,000 if she wanted to remain on staff. Atkinson left the institute in 2016., Another plaintiff, Natasha Anushri Anandaraja, 44, is a pediatrician and tropical medicine expert who directed global health education at AIGH. Singh “regularly denigrated Anandaraja’s work with harsh and cutting critiques,” the lawsuit alleges. “[H]e was careful not to leave a paper trail demonstrating his frequent cruelty.” Anandaraja left the center in 2016. (She has since returned to Mount Sinai part time in another capacity and does not report to Singh.), The male plaintiff, Humale Khan, is a computer scientist who left the institute in February. He and other plaintiffs allege that Singh misled funding groups about a software project supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development in Washington, D.C. Singh, the lawsuit alleges, told funders the project was advancing and had hundreds of users, when it was in fact “vaporware … a vague collection of specifications and unfinished code.” The lawsuit also alleges that Singh violated a law meant to protect patient data and failed to get required ethics committee approvals for some projects involving human subjects., AIGH had been called Mount Sinai Global Health. But after a $12.5 million, 2013 donation from the Arnholds, a prominent New York banking family, it was renamed in their honor., *Correction, 4 May, 7 p.m.: This article has been updated to correct Prabjhot Singh's previous positions at Columbia University.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/sinai_16x9.jpg?itok=Tw4xM7u0","title":"Global health institute sued for age and sex discrimination","authors":"Meredith Wadman","pub_date":"May. 2, 2019 , 3:05 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/global-health-institute-sued-age-and-sex-discrimination"},{"abstract":"Math may have caught up with the swirling mergers of black holes like the one in this simulation., By Adrian ChoMay. 2, 2019 , 3:10 PM, Just a month into a renewed observing campaign with a trio of detectors, physicists today announced they have spotted more gravitational waves—fleeting ripples in space set off when two massive objects such as black holes spiral into each other. The collaboration has now bagged 13 merging black hole pairs, as well as two pairs of neutron stars. But even as detections accumulate, one theorist has made an advance that could change how the team analyzes the signals and make it easier to test Albert Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity., To interpret their signals gravitational wave hunters compare them to computer simulations. Now, Sean McWilliams, a theoretical astrophysicist at West Virginia University in Morgantown, has calculated an exact mathematical formula for the signal, or waveform, produced by two merging black holes., “It’s a big step forward,” says Neil Cornish, a gravitational wave astronomer at Montana State University in Bozeman who was not involved in the work. “It’s going to allow for more accurate waveforms for doing analysis. But it also gives us more insight into what’s going on” in a black hole merger., In 1916, Einstein predicted that as two stars orbit each other they’d radiate gravitational waves, although he figured the waves would be too feeble to detect. In 2015, physicists with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) spotted a burst of waves from two black holes that merged 1.3 billion light-years away, using their huge optical instruments in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana. The Virgo detector near Pisa, Italy, joined the hunt in August 2017, enabling the collaboration to triangulate to the sources of the events on the sky., As two black holes spiral ever closer, they emit ripples in space that speed up. The waves’ intensity peaks as the two objects collide, and then peter out as the final, merged black hole undulates and settles down. To decipher the signal and determine the black holes’ masses and other parameters, scientists compare it to a catalog of simulated signals, a tack they have taken because of the complexity of the problem., According to general relativity, gravity arises when mass and energy warp spacetime. And a black hole is the ultraintense gravitational field left behind when a massive star collapses to an infinitesimal point. So when two black holes swirl together, warping begets warping and renders the mathematics “nonlinear” and intractable., Or so many scientists assumed. McWilliams says he has found a way to calculate the signal mathematically after all, as he reports in a paper in press at Physical Review Letters., Two relatively simple formulas describe the peak and reverberation of gravitational wave signals like the first ones the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory saw., The calculation involves special distances from the center of the black hole. Famously, nothing can escape a black hole if it draws closer than a characteristic distance called the event horizon. At a distance about 1.5 times that of the event horizon, the black hole’s gravity will bend passing light into a circular orbit, defining the “light ring.” A distance roughly three times that of the event horizon marks the limit for a massive object to maintain a circular orbit and not spiral in, a threshold called the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)., Previous attempts to calculate the exact waveform from a black hole merger relied on a standard mathematical transformation, turning the problem of two orbiting black holes into one of a single body spiraling in a funnel-shaped energy landscape. But within the ISCO, the body stops spiraling, forcing researchers to correct its path with numerical simulations. McWilliams realized he could avoid that problem by skipping to the final merged black hole. He then used general relativity to calculate how a tiny test mass spirals into and perturbs the final black hole, enabling him to calculate the radiated signal from the ISCO inward., Once the test particle reaches the light ring, tracing its trajectory becomes mathematically untenable. But McWilliams says the physics there can be ignored for a simple reason: All the churning of spacetime within the light ring cannot escape to influence the spreading gravitational waves. Essentially, the black hole itself slurps up all the nasty nonlinearities. McWilliams provides a pair of formulas that neatly match the simulations. “I’ll be honest,” he says, “I was rather floored how well it agrees with the results of numerical relativity.”, Those formulas could prove valuable in tests of general relativity, McWilliams says, especially as black holes are objects made of pure gravitational energy, with no messy matter to get in the way. LIGO’s and Virgo’s observations have already confirmed general relativity’s accuracy to an unprecedented level, but researchers should be able to push further as they hone their instruments’ sensitivity. They’ll need more precise predictions of the waveforms from general relativity, McWilliams says, and the exact formulas should be more accurate than the numerical simulations., Lionel London, a gravitational wave theorist and LIGO team member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, isn’t so sure. McWilliams still has to rely on simulations to model the spiraling outside the ISCO, he notes, and that part of the signal is key to determining the masses of the initial black holes. The calculations also depend on certain simplifying assumptions, but do not provide estimates of the uncertainties carried with them, he says. The formulas are more of an “ansatz”—an educated guess at how the signal should look—than an exact solution to the problem, London says., Cornish agrees it’s too early to replace numerical relativity. Still, he says, the formulas will be useful and should spur physicists to explain why black hole mergers seem to be simpler than they had anticipated. “There’s more to be learned.”, In the meantime, LIGO and Virgo researchers will have no shortage of signals. During the first month of their third observing run, they have detected five new candidate events, including three black hole mergers, a second neutron star merger, and a possible black hole-neutron star merger spotted last week. The mixed merger would be another gem for scientists, as they lack even good estimates of how often such things should occur. “Because it’s such an interesting astrophysical object, it’s generating a lot of excitement, which I think it deserves,” says Jessica McIver, a physicist and LIGO team member from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena., Still, the tantalizing signal is relatively weak. Researchers estimate that random noise should produce a similar spurious signal about once every 20 months, and there’s a 14% chance that it originated in terrestrial vibrations. “If you ask me, ‘Would you bet a coffee, your car, or your house on this?’ I would say, ‘I’d bet your car,’” says Salvatore Vitale, a physicist and LIGO member from MIT. To nail the case for the supposed mixed merger, astronomers would likely have to spot light and electromagnetic waves from it.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/main_16x9_9.jpg?itok=bgb-abfO","title":"Theorist calculates the incalculable siren song of merging black holes","authors":"Adrian Cho","pub_date":"May. 2, 2019 , 3:10 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/theorist-calculates-incalculable-siren-song-merging-black-holes"}]
