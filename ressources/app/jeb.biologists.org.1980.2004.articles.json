To partition\nheat loss to air and water, we measured the body temperature, metabolism and\nthermal conductance of 2–3-day-old mallard ducklings (Anas\nplatyrhynchos) swimming under different combinations of air and water\ntemperature. Ventral down remained dry or was wetted only on the surface, and\nmost ducklings could maintain Tb>39°C for 1 h while\nswimming on water as cold as 5°C. Ducklings were at or below thermal\nneutrality when swimming in water at Tw=30°C even when\nair temperature Ta=45°C. Heat loss from ducklings with\ndry down to air and water was partitioned by fitting data to a heat transfer\nmodel of the form\nM=G(Tb–Tw)+Ke(Tb–Ta).\nFor an average 48 g duckling, thermal conductance to water increased with\nwater temperature,\nG=0.0470(1+1.059×10–6Tw4)W/°C-animal.\nConductance to air was Ke=0.0196 W/°C-animal for all\nair temperatures.

Owing to vestibular compensation,\nUL animals gradually restore postural equilibrium and, in a few weeks, swim\nwithout rolling. Important elements of the postural network in the lamprey are\nthe reticulospinal (RS) neurons, which are driven by vestibular input and\ntransmit commands for postural corrections to the spinal cord. As shown\npreviously, a loss of equilibrium after UL is associated with disappearance of\nvestibular responses in the contralateral group of RS neurons. Are these\nresponses restored in animals after compensation? To answer this question, we\nrecorded vestibular responses in RS neurons (elicited by rotation of the\ncompensated animal in the roll plane) by means of chronically implanted\nelectrodes. We found that the responses re-appeared in the compensated\nanimals. This result supports the hypothesis that the loss of equilibrium\nafter UL was caused by asymmetry in supraspinal motor commands, and the\nrecovery of postural control in compensated animals was due to a restoration\nof symmetry."},{"title":"Multiple cone visual pigments and the potential for trichromatic colour vision in two species of elasmobranch","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/26/4587","abstract":"Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) are the modern descendents of the\nfirst jawed vertebrates and, as apex predators, often occupy the highest\ntrophic levels of aquatic (predominantly marine) ecosystems.

Indirect calorimetry and nitrogen excretion measurements were\nused to assess changes in metabolic rate\n(V̇O2), fuel\nselection and composition of nitrogen wastes, as well as seasonal differences.\nFor reference, matching experiments were also performed on rabbits. The\nresults show that woodchucks have a higher metabolic rate in summer (271μ\nmol O2 kg-1 min-1) than in spring (200μ\nmol O2 kg-1 min-1) and that\nfasting-induced metabolic depression is only possible in summer (-25% in 14\ndays). The metabolic rate of rabbits is high at all times (383 μmol\nO2 kg-1 min-1), but they show a more rapid\ndepression in response to fasting (-32% in 7 days). Woodchucks have a\nnaturally low reliance on proteins in the fed state (accounting for 8%\nV̇O2 in spring;\n17% V̇O2 in\nsummer; vs 28%\nV̇O2 in rabbits)\nand are able to decrease it even further during fasting (spring, 5%\nV̇O2; summer, 6%\nV̇O2; vs\n20% V̇O2 in\nrabbits). This study shows that, apart from their notorious capacity for\nhibernation, woodchucks are particularly well adapted for normothermic\nfasting. Their ability to cope with prolonged food deprivation is based on a\nseries of integrated responses eliciting deep metabolic depression and a rapid\nchange in fuel selection to spare limited protein reserves. Information\npresently available on prolonged fasting suggests that such an ability for\nmetabolic depression, possibly down to minimal levels still compatible with\nnormothermic life, may be common among mammals.

Specifically, descending brain interneuron Tr2 functions as a\ncommand-like neuron that can terminate or sometimes trigger fictive swimming.\nIn this study, we demonstrate that Tr2 is dye coupled to the dopaminergic\nneural network distributed in the head brain. These findings represent the\nfirst anatomical evidence in support of dopamine (DA) playing a role in the\nmodulation of locomotion in the leech. In addition, we have determined that\nbath application of DA to the brain and entire nerve cord reliably and rapidly\nterminates swimming in all preparations exhibiting fictive swimming. By\ncontrast, DA application to nerve cords expressing ongoing fictive crawling\ndoes not inhibit this motor rhythm. Furthermore, we show that Tr2 receives\nrhythmic feedback from the crawl central pattern generator. For example, Tr2\nreceives inhibitory post-synaptic potentials during the elongation phase of\neach crawl cycle. When crawling is not expressed, spontaneous inhibitory\npost-synaptic potentials in Tr2 correlate in time with spontaneous excitatory\npost-synaptic potentials in the CV motor neuron, a circular muscle excitor\nthat bursts during the elongation phase of crawling.

To test this hypothesis we studied the basic mechanisms\nof oxygen regulation in podocopid ostracods, minute crustaceans that have\nexisted on earth for at least 500 million years.

The\ncross-sectional areas of fast and slow muscle fibres were measured at 0.7\nFL in 46 DB morphs, 23 LB morphs, 24 PL morphs and 22 PI morphs, and\nthe ages of the charr were estimated using sacculus otoliths. In fish larger\nthan 10 g, the maximum fibre diameter scaled with body mass\n(Mb)0.18 for both fibre types in all morphs.\nThe number of myonuclei per cm fibre length increased with fibre diameter, but\nwas similar between morphs. On average, at 60 μm diameter, there were 2264\nnuclei cm–1 in slow fibres and 1126 nuclei\ncm–1 in fast fibres. The absence of fibres of diameter\n4–10 μm was used to determine the FL at which muscle fibre\nrecruitment stopped. Slow fibre number increased with body length in all\nmorphs, scaling with Mb0.45. In contrast, the\nrecruitment of fast muscle fibres continued until a clearly identifiable\nFL, corresponding to 18–19 cm in the dwarf morph, 24–26\ncm in the pelagic morph, 32–33 cm in the large benthic morph and\n34–35 cm in the piscivorous morph.

The progeny showed no evidence of\ndevelopmental plasticity in the numbers of either MPCs or muscle fibres.\nJuveniles and adult stages of the DB and LB morphs coexist and have a similar\ndiet. We therefore conclude that the reduction in FNmax in\nthe dwarf morph probably has a genetic basis and that gene networks regulating\nmyotube production are under high selection pressure. To explain these\nfindings we propose that there is an optimal fibre size, and hence number,\nwhich varies with maximum body size and reflects a trade-off between\ndiffusional constraints on fibre diameter and the energy costs of maintaining\nionic gradients. The predictions of the optimal fibre size hypothesis and its\nconsequences for the adaptive evolution of muscle architecture in fishes are\nbriefly discussed."},{"title":"Floral scents induce recall of navigational and visual memories in honeybees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/25/4371","abstract":"During foraging flights, honeybees learn visual and chemical cues\nassociated with a food source.

With this study we provide a detailed analysis of the coordinated\nfin and axial movements during slow and fast swimming by examining forward\nlocomotion in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio L.). In addition, we\ndescribe the musculature that powers pectoral fin movement in larval zebrafish\nand discuss its functional implications. As larvae, zebrafish alternate their\npectoral fins during slow swimming (0.011±0.001 mm\nms–1) in conjunction with axial undulations of the same\nfrequency (18–28 Hz). During fast swimming (0.109±0.030 mm\nms–1; 36–67 Hz), the fins are tucked against the body\nand propulsion occurs by axial undulation alone. We show that during swimming,\nlarval fishes can use a similar limb–axis coordination pattern to that\nof walking and running salamanders.

The genes encoding Myf-5 and MyoD\nwere switched on first in the unsegmented mesoderm, followed by myogenin as\nthe somites developed. Myf-5 and MyoD transcripts were\ninitially limited to the adaxial cells, but Myf-5 expression spread\nlaterally into the presomitic mesoderm before somite formation. Two distinct\nbands of staining could be seen corresponding to the cellular fields of the\nforming somites, but as each furrow delineated, Myf-5 mRNA levels\ndeclined.

On both terrestrial and\narboreal substrates, fore limbs exhibited higher vertical impulse and peak\nvertical force than hind limbs. Although vertical limb impulses were lower on\nthe terrestrial substrate than on the arboreal support, this was probably due\nto speed effects because the opossums refused to move as quickly on the\narboreal trackway. Vertical impulse decreased significantly faster with speed\non the arboreal substrate because most of these trials were relatively slow,\nand stance duration decreased with speed more rapidly at these lower speeds.\nWhile braking and propulsive roles were more segregated between limbs on the\nterrestrial trackway, fore limbs were dominant both in braking and in\npropulsion on the arboreal trackway. Both fore and hind limbs exerted\nequivalently strong, medially directed limb forces on the arboreal trackway\nand laterally directed limb forces on the terrestrial trackway. We propose\nthat the modifications in substrate reaction force on the arboreal trackway\nare due to the differential placement of the limbs about the dorsolateral\naspect of the branch.

Accelerating dragonflies switch to in-phase wing-beats\nwith highly separated downstroke flows, with a single LEV attached across both\nthe fore- and hindwings. We use smoke visualizations to distinguish between\nthe three simplest local analytical solutions of the Navier–Stokes\nequations yielding flow separation resulting in a LEV. The LEV is an open\nU-shaped separation, continuous across the thorax, running parallel to the\nwing leading edge and inflecting at the tips to form wingtip vortices. Air\nspirals in to a free-slip critical point over the centreline as the LEV grows.\nSpanwise flow is not a dominant feature of the flow field – spanwise\nflows sometimes run from wingtip to centreline, or vice versa –\ndepending on the degree of sideslip. LEV formation always coincides with rapid\nincreases in angle of attack, and the smoke visualizations clearly show the\nformation of LEVs whenever a rapid increase in angle of attack occurs. There\nis no discrete starting vortex. Instead, a shear layer forms behind the\ntrailing edge whenever the wing is at a non-zero angle of attack, and rolls\nup, under Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, into a series of transverse\nvortices with circulation of opposite sign to the circulation around the wing\nand LEV. The flow fields produced by dragonflies differ qualitatively from\nthose published for mechanical models of dragonflies, fruitflies and\nhawkmoths, which preclude natural wing interactions.

We tested the\nhypothesis that net mechanical work per step increases in proportion to\nacceleration at all four major hind limb joints (hip, knee, ankle and\ntarsometatarsal–phalangeal joint). This hypothesis was based on the idea\nthat all hind limb muscles should contribute mechanical work to maximize\nperformance during accelerations, and a previous study that indicated the\nmechanical power output of the entire turkey hind limb musculature was\nremarkably high. We used high-speed video and force-plate measurements to\nmeasure joint moment, velocity and power output during single foot-contacts of\nrunning accelerations. By measuring steps in which the animals were relatively\nmore or less motivated to accelerate, we obtained data for a range of\naccelerations, all at approximately the same running speed. Net joint work per\nstep increased at the hip and ankle as a function of acceleration. Hip net\nwork per unit body mass was 0.12±0.09 J kg-1 averaged over\nthe five lowest accelerations (–0.22±0.08 m s-2), and\n0.87±0.20 J kg-1 for the five highest accelerations\n(4.86±0.27 m s-2).

These results support the idea that hip and ankle extensors contribute\nsignificantly to the work necessary to accelerate the body.We also measured the change in joint moment and angular excursion with\nacceleration to determine whether the mechanism for increasing work output at\na joint involved an increase in muscle force or muscle shortening. The\nincrease in joint work at the hip and ankle resulted almost entirely from an\nincrease in joint angular excursion during stance. Hip extension increased by\nmore than threefold from the lowest to the highest accelerations, and the\nangular excursion of the ankle increased from –24.8±4.7° (net\nflexion) at the lowest accelerations to 33.0±12.8° (net extension)\nat the highest accelerations. Mean stance joint moment was unchanged with\nacceleration at the ankle and increased by approximately 35% at the hip across\nthe range of accelerations. These patterns of joint moment and excursion\nindicate that turkeys increase mechanical work for acceleration primarily by\nincreasing muscle shortening, rather than muscle force."},{"title":"Why do macaroni penguins choose shallow body angles that result in longer descent and ascent durations?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/23/4057","abstract":"It is generally assumed that air-breathing aquatic animals always choose\nthe shortest route to minimize duration for transit between the surface and\nforaging depth in order to maximize the proportion of time spent foraging.\nHowever, empirical data indicate that the body angles of some diving animals\nare rarely vertical during descent and ascent. Why do they choose shallower\nbody angles that result in longer descent and ascent durations? To investigate\nthis question, we attached acceleration data loggers to eight female macaroni\npenguins, breeding on the Kerguelen Islands\n(48°45′–50°00′S,\n68°45′–70°58′E; South Indian Ocean), to record\ndepth, two-dimensional acceleration (stroke cycle frequency and body angle)\nand temperature.

The instrumented females performed multiple dives\n(N=6952) with a mean dive depth for each bird ranging from\n24.5±28.5 m to 56.4±75.1 m. Mean body angles during descent and\nascent were not vertical. There was large variation in mean descent and ascent\nangles for a given dive depth, which, in turn, caused large variation in\ndescent and ascent duration. Body angles were significantly correlated with\ntime spent at the bottom-phase of the dive. Birds that spent long periods at\nthe bottom exhibited steep body angles during ascent and subsequent descent.\nBy contrast, they adopted shallow body angles after they had short or no\nbottom phases. Our results suggest that macaroni penguins stay at the bottom\nlonger after encountering a good prey patch and then travel to the surface at\nsteep body angles. If they do not encounter prey, they discontinue the dive,\nwithout staying at the bottom, ascend at shallow body angles and descend at\nshallow body angles in a subsequent dive. A shallow body angle can increase\nthe horizontal distance covered during a dive, contributing to the move into a\nmore profitable area in the following dive. During the ascent, in particular,\nmacaroni penguins stopped beating their flippers.

Second, how similar is a terrestrial escape response to an\naquatic escape response? Because a mudskipper on land does not have to contend\nwith the high viscosity of water, we predicted that, if the same behavior is\nemployed across environments, terrestrial escape responses should have\n`better' performance (higher velocity and more rapid completion of movements)\nwhen compared with aquatic escape responses. By contrast, we predicted that\nintervertebral bending would be similar across environments because previous\nstudies of escape response behaviors in fishes have proposed that vertebral\nmorphology constrains intervertebral bending. High-speed digital imaging was\nused to record mudskipper escapes in water and on land, and the resulting\nimages were used to calculate intervertebral bending during the preparatory\nphase, peak velocity and acceleration of the center of mass during the\npropulsive phase, and relative timing of movements.

It was hypothesized that aerobically dependent processes,\nsuch as metabolic recovery following burst contractions, will be significantly\nimpeded in the large white fibers. In addition, dark aerobic fibers of adults,\nwhich rely on aerobic metabolism for both contraction and recovery, grow as\nlarge as the white fibers. These large aerobic fibers are subdivided, however,\nthus decreasing the effective diameter of each metabolic functional unit and\nenabling aerobic contraction. The two goals of this study were: (1) to\ncharacterize the development of subdivisions in the dark levator muscle fibers\nand (2) to monitor post-contractile metabolism as a function of fiber size in\naerobic and anaerobic levator muscles. Dark levator muscle fibers from crabs\nranging from <0.1 g to >190 g were examined with transmission electron\nmicroscopy to determine the density of mitochondria and subdivision diameters.\nAcross all size classes, there was a constant mitochondrial fractional area\n(25% of the total subdivision area) and subdivision size (mean diameter of\n36.5±2.7 μm). Thus, blue crab dark levator fibers are unusual in\nhaving metabolic functional units (subdivisions) that do not increase in size\nduring development while the contractile functional units (fibers) grow\nhypertrophically. The body mass scaling of post-contractile lactate dynamics\nwas monitored during recovery from anaerobic, burst exercise in white and dark\nmuscle, and in hemolymph. There were no differences among size classes in\nlactate accumulation during exercise in either muscle. However, in white\nfibers from large crabs, lactate continued to increase after exercise, and\nlactate removal from tissues required a much longer period of time relative to\nsmaller crabs. Differences in lactate removal among size classes were less\npronounced in dark fibers, and post-contractile lactate accumulation was\nsignificantly higher in white than in dark fibers from large animals. These\ndata suggest that the large white fibers invoke anaerobic metabolism following\ncontraction to accelerate certain phases of metabolic recovery that otherwise\nwould be overly slow. This implies that, in addition to the typical\nmass-specific decrease in oxidative capacity that accompanies increases in\nanimal mass, aerobic metabolic processes become increasingly limited by\nsurface area to volume and intracellular diffusion constraints in developing\nwhite muscle fibers."},{"title":"Presence and properties of cellulase and hemicellulase enzymes of the\ngecarcinid land crabs Gecarcoidea natalis and Discoplax\nhirtipes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/23/4095","abstract":"Digestive juice from the herbivorous gecarcinid land crabs Gecarcoidea\nnatalis and Discoplax hirtipes exhibited total cellulase\nactivity and activities of two cellulase enzymes; endo-β-1,4-glucanase\nand β-1,4-glucosidase.

Even\nif V̇O2 during\ndiving was assumed to be the same as when the birds were resting on water,\napproximately 20% of dives would exceed the cADL. As\nV̇O2 during diving\nis, in fact, that estimated for a complete dive cycle, it is quite feasible\nthat V̇O2 during\ndiving itself is less than that measured for birds resting in water. It is\nsuggested that the regional hypothermia that has been recorded in this species\nduring diving bouts may be at least a contributing factor to such\nhypometabolism."},{"title":"A set of female pheromones affects reproduction before, during and after\nmating in Drosophila","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/22/3927","abstract":"Sex pheromones are chemical signals used for mate attraction and\ndiscrimination in many invertebrate species.

These frogs use two different gaits, asynchronous and\nsynchronous kicking, and the magnitude of the thrust produced by the feet\ndiffers between asynchronous (34±5.4 mN foot–1) and\nsynchronous kicking (71±13.3 mN foot–1), as does\nmaximum swimming speed, with higher swimming speed and forces produced during\nthe synchronous kicks. Previous studies have suggested that an interaction\nbetween the feet, resulting in a single posteriorly directed fluid jet, as the\nfeet come together at the end of synchronous kicks, may augment force\nproduction. Our results show, however, that each foot produces its own\ndistinct vortex ring, in both asynchronous and synchronous kicking of the\nfeet. There is no evidence of a central jet being produced even during\npowerful synchronous kicks (maximum thrust calculated was 264 mN\nfoot–1). An alternative mechanism of force production could\nbe the lift-based paddling recently suggested for delta-shaped feet of\nswimming birds. However, the orientation of the vortex rings generated by the\nfeet is almost perpendicular to the swimming direction for both gaits and\nthere is only a slight asynchrony of the shedding of the distal (start) and\nproximal (stop) vortex rings, which is different from what would be expected\nby a dominantly lift-based mechanism. Thus, our results do not support lift as\na major mechanism contributing to thrust. Instead, our data support the\nhypothesis that propulsion is based on drag and acceleration reaction forces\nwhere the thrust is generated by separated, but attached, vortex rings on the\nsuction side of the feet, resulting in vortices that are shed behind the frogs\nduring both asynchronous and synchronous kicking."},{"title":"Comparison of the cost of short flights in a nectarivorous and a non-nectarivorous bird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/22/3959","abstract":"Although most birds are accustomed to making short flights, particularly\nduring foraging, the flight patterns during these short periods of activity\ndiffer between species.

The peak force\nproduced by the main jumping muscle of female flies from a wild-type\n(Canton-S) strain is 101±4.4 μN [and this is indistinguishable from\na second wild-type (Texas) strain]. The force takes 8.2 ms to reach\nits peak. The peak force is not affected significantly by altering the leg\nangle (femur–tibia joint angle) in the range of 75–120°, but\nthe peak force declines as the leg is extended further.Measurements of jumping ability (distance jumped) showed that female\nDrosophila (with their wings removed) of two wild-type strains,\nCanton-S and Texas, produced jumps of 28.6±0.7 and 30.2±1.0 mm\n(mean ± s.e.m.).

Although field studies indicate that fishes often\nprefer turbulent flows over uniform currents, the effect of hydrodynamic\nperturbations on the mechanics, control and energetics of locomotion is still\npoorly understood.

Anterior axial muscle activity was correlated to head\namplitude during steady swimming but not during the Kármán gait,\nindicating that while activation of muscles during the Kármán\ngait may aid in stability and control, vortices determined overall head\nmotion.

Comparisons with dead trout towed behind a cylinder confirm this\nintriguing observation that live trout may temporarily adopt the\nKármán gait with no axial muscle activity, revealing\nparadoxically that at times fish can passively move against turbulent flow. To\nKármán gait for prolonged periods, however, trout must adapt to\nthe demands of turbulence by eliciting a shift in neural control strategy.

Here, we investigate species-specific responses to 3-methyl\npyrazine in a sub-Antarctic species assemblage near South Georgia Island\n(54°00 ′ S, 36°00 ′ W). Pyrazines are scented compounds\nfound in macerated Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), a primary\nprey item for many seabird species in this region.

Responses to pyrazine were both highly species\nspecific and consistent with results from earlier studies investigating\nresponses to crude krill extracts.

We collected\nkinematic and ground reaction force data from dogs walking over a range of\nspeeds. We found that the fore and hind quarters of dogs behaved like two\nindependent bipeds, each vaulting up and over its respective support limb. The\ncenter of mass moved up and down twice per stride, like a single walking\nbiped, and up to 70% of the mechanical energy required to lift and accelerate\nthe center of mass was recovered via the inverted pendulum mechanism.\nTo understand how the limbs produce these center of mass movements, we created\na simple model of two independent pendulums representing the movements of the\nfore and hind quarters. The model predicted that the fore and hind quarter\nmovements would completely offset each other if the fore limb lagged the hind\nlimb by 25% of the stride time and body mass was distributed equally between\nthe fore and hind quarters. The primary reason that dogs did not walk with a\nflat trajectory of the center of mass was that each fore limb lagged its\nipsilateral hind limb by only 15% of the stride time and thereby produced time\nperiods when the fore and hind quarters moved up or down simultaneously. The\nsecondary reason was that the fore limbs supported 63% of body mass.\nConsistent with these experimental results, the two-pendulum model predicts\nthat the center of mass will undergo two fluctuations per stride cycle if limb\nphase is less than 25% and/or if the total mass is not distributed evenly\nbetween the fore or hind quarters."},{"title":"Transmission of linearly polarized light in seawater: implications for polarization signaling","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/20/3619","abstract":"Partially linearly polarized light is abundant in the oceans.

At higher concentrations (200-1000 μmol\nl-1), there was no further increase in apoptosis but a significant\nincrease in the level of necrosis. In stark contrast to vertebrate immune\ncells, there was no decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential or\nactivation of caspases in response to Cd2+ in the apoptotic range.\nSurprisingly, Cd2+ exposure in this range did cause a significant\ndecrease in intracellular ATP levels, indicating a severe disturbance of\nenergy metabolism.

Differences in Na+ regulation\nbetween each population might partially account for this difference in\ntolerance, because plasma Na+ was decreased for a longer period in\nsouthern survivors than in northerns. Furthermore, northern fish increased\nNa+/K+-ATPase mRNA expression and activity in their\ngills to a greater extent 1-14 days after transfer than did southerns, which\npreceded higher whole-body net flux and unidirectional influx of\nNa+ at 14 days.

Plasma Cl- was maintained in northern\nfish, but in southerns, plasma Cl- decreased rapidly and remained\nlow for the duration of the experiment. Correspondingly, net Cl-\nloss from southern fish remained high after transfer, while northerns\neliminated Cl- loss altogether.

Bioconvective patterns recorded of three different cell\nstrains (T. pyriformis, T. thermophila and its behavioral mutant,\nTNR) were analyzed quantitatively using space-time plot and Fourier analysis.\nFor example, under subcritical conditions, when T. pyriformis\n(1.0×106 cells ml-1) was placed in a 2 mm-deep\nchamber, no spatial pattern was observed at 1 g. When the suspension\nwas centrifuged, however, patterns began to appear as acceleration increased\nover a critical value (1.5 g), and then remained steady.

Levels of\nmvl mRNA in the brain and manganese in the head were higher in pollen\nforagers compared with nurses, with nectar foragers intermediate. Manganese\ntreatment increased honey bee sucrose responsiveness and caused precocious\nforaging. Manganese levels showed a similar pattern to mvl mRNA but\nmanganese treatment did not increase pollen foraging. These results suggest\nthat, while there are molecular pathways common to sucrose responsiveness and\ndivision of labor, linkages between a complex behavior and some of its simpler\nbehavioral components are not obligatory. Together with previous findings,\nthese results support the idea that some feeding-related genes in\nDrosophila have been used in social evolution to regulate division of\nlabor."},{"title":"Evidence that thyroid hormone induces olfactory cellular proliferation in salmon during a sensitive period for imprinting","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/19/3317","abstract":"Salmon have long been known to imprint and home to natal stream odors, yet\nthe mechanisms driving olfactory imprinting remain obscure. The timing of\nimprinting is associated with elevations in plasma thyroid hormone levels,\nwith possible effects on growth and proliferation of the peripheral olfactory\nsystem. Here, we begin to test this idea by determining whether experimentally\nelevated plasma levels of 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3)\ninfluence cell proliferation as detected by the 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine\n(BrdU) cell birth-dating technique in the olfactory epithelium of juvenile\ncoho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). We also explore how natural\nfluctuations in thyroxine (T4) relate to proliferation in the\nepithelium during the parr-smolt transformation. In both studies, we found\nthat BrdU labeled both single and clusters of mitotic cells. The total number\nof BrdU-labeled cells in the olfactory epithelium was significantly greater in\nfish with artificially elevated T3 compared with placebo controls.\nThis difference in proliferation was restricted to the basal region of the\nolfactory epithelium, where multipotent progenitor cells differentiate into\nolfactory receptor neurons. The distributions of mitotic cluster sizes\ndiffered significantly from a Poisson distribution for both T3 and\nplacebo treatments, suggesting that proliferation tends to be non-random. Over\nthe course of the parr-smolt transformation, changes in the density of BrdU\ncells showed a positive relationship with natural fluctuations in plasma\nT4. This relationship suggests that even small changes in thyroid\nactivity can stimulate the proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the\nsalmon epithelium. Taken together, our results establish a link between the\nthyroid hormone axis and measurable anatomical changes in the peripheral\nolfactory system."},{"title":"Structural basis for control of secondary vessels in the long-finned eel\nAnguilla reinhardtii","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/19/3339","abstract":"Histological sections of primary segmental arteries and associated\ninterarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels from the long-finned eel\nAnguilla reinhardtii were examined by light and transmission electron\nmicroscopy.

In contrast to findings from other\nspecies, secondary vessels had a structure quite similar to that of primary\nvessels; they were lined by endothelial cells on a continuous basement\nmembrane, with a single layer of smooth muscle cells surrounding the vessel.\nSmooth muscle cells were also found in the vicinity of interarterial\nanastomoses in the adventitia, but these appeared more longitudinally\norientated. The presence of smooth muscle cells on all aspects of the\nsecondary circulation suggests that this vascular system is regulated in a\nsimilar manner as the primary vascular system. Because interarterial\nanastomoses are structurally integrated with the primary vessel from which\nthey originate, it is anticipated that flow through secondary vessels to some\nextent is affected by the vascular tone of the primary vessel.\nImmunohistochemical studies showed that primary segmental arteries displayed\nmoderate immunoreactivity to antibodies against 5-hydroxytryptamine and\nsubstance P, while interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels showed\ndense immunoreactivity.

Although these birds are rendered flightless during wing\nmolt, they must still use their wings to propel themselves underwater. A\nmolt-induced loss of wing area could simply reduce wing propulsion such that\nmore muscular work would be required to maintain a given speed. Alternatively,\nmolt could reduce drag on the wings, making a bird more penguin-like and\nactually enhancing diving ability. I addressed this issue by filming captive\ncommon guillemots Uria aalge and tufted puffins Fratercula\ncirrhata using an array of video cameras to plot the birds' movements in\nthree dimensions. From these coordinate data I calculated swimming velocities,\nangles of descent and absolute depths. These values allowed me to estimate the\nforces due to drag and buoyancy that must be counteracted by flapping, which\nin turn yielded estimates of the amount of work generated during each flap as\nwell as the average power and cost of transport. Within-bird comparisons of\ndiving performance when wings were intact and during several stages of wing\nmolt indicated that molt is associated with more frequent flapping, reduced\ndisplacement during the flap cycle, and possibly reduced work per flap. These\nnegative effects on diving may explain why primary and secondary molts were\noffset in the birds I studied such that the period during which all of the\nflight feathers are effectively missing is minimized."},{"title":"Expression of hypothalamic arginine vasotocin gene in response to water deprivation and sex steroid administration in female Japanese quail","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/17/3025","abstract":"Arginine vasotocin (AVT) is a neurohypophyseal hormone involved in\nreproductive function and control of osmoregulation in birds.

Our findings indicate that although sex steroid administration has\nno effect on plasma osmolality and AVT concentration, unlike water\ndeprivation, it may stimulate the profile/activity of AVT neurons of PVN,\nsupporting the possibility of sex steroid receptors on these neurons. It is\nconcluded that in quail, osmotic stress not only upregulates the expression of\nthe AVT gene in existing neurons but also recruits many more neurons to\nincrease the rate of AVT synthesis and secretion, while sex steroids appear to\nhave a stimulatory effect only on the existing number of neurons and only at\nthe level of transcription/translation and hence may influence/modulate\nhypothalamic AVT gene expression in response to osmotic stress.

This is of particular interest because there are no\nextensor muscles or any obvious mechanisms for directing hydraulic flow into\nthe proleg. In restrained tobacco hornworms (Manduca sexta),\nadduction can be evoked by stimulating mechanosensory hairs on the medial\nsurface of the proleg. 3-D kinematics show that extension and adduction occur\nsimultaneously through an unfolding of membrane between the pseudo segments.\nHemolymph pressure pulses are not necessary to extend the proleg; instead, the\npressure at the base of the proleg decreases before adduction and increases\nbefore retraction. It is proposed that these pressure changes are caused by\nmuscles that stiffen and relax the body wall during cycles of retraction and\nadduction. Electromyographic recordings show that relaxation of the principal\nplanta retractor muscle is essential for normal adduction.

(Coreidae) bears a pair of\nsmooth flexible pulvilli adapted for attachment to relatively smooth surfaces,\nsuch as their host plant Rumex crispus L. (Polygonaceae). This\naccount quantifies insect attachment abilities on smooth surfaces at various\nstages of ontogenesis. Friction (shear) force (FF) of adults and juvenile\ninsects was measured by the use of a computer controlled centrifugal force\ntester equipped with a fibre optical sensor. Pad area, body size and body mass\nwere determined individually for each experimental insect. Light microscopy\nrevealed no difference in pulvilli area between different leg pairs. Pulvilli\narea demonstrated a stronger increase with increasing linear dimensions, as\npredicted by scaling laws. Since friction coefficient (relationship between FF\nand body weight) (FC) was always higher than 1, it was concluded that adhesion\nhas strongly contributed to the measured friction. The frictional properties\nof pulvilli do not change during ontogenesis. Thus, only the growth of\npulvilli and, therefore, the increased contact area, contribute to the\nincreasing attachment ability in insects at later larval stages. Due to\ndifferent scaling of the body mass and area of attachment organs, smaller\ninsects attach relatively more strongly. Both FF and FC were higher in\nexperiments in which higher angular acceleration (AC) was applied. Lateral\ntenacity determined individually for experimental insects and pooled for all\nanimals and accelerations is 0.097 N m-2. These data led us to\nsuggest that viscosity of the pad secretion and/or visco-elastic properties of\nthe foam-like material of pulvilli play an important role in the attachment\nability of insects."},{"title":"Cytotoxicity of diatom-derived oxylipins in organisms belonging to different phyla","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/17/2935","abstract":"The cytotoxicity of several saturated and unsaturated marine diatom-derived\naldehydes and an oxo-acid have been screened in vitro and in\nvivo against different organisms, such as bacteria, algae, fungi,\nechinoderms, molluscs and crustaceans.

To investigate the role of the glandular digestive zone in the\ntrapping mechanism of the pitcher, structural, mechanical and physico-chemical\nstudies were applied to N. ventrata and combined with insect\nbehavioural experiments. It was found that the glandular surface is\nmicroscopically rough since it is regularly structured with multicellular\nglands situated in epidermal depressions. The presence of downward-directed\n`hoods' over the upper part of glands and sloped depressions in the proximal\ndirection of the pitcher causes a marked anisotropy of the surface. The\nglandular zone surface is composed of relatively stiff material (Young's\nmodulus, 637.19±213.44 kPa). It is not homogeneous, in terms of\nadhesive properties, and contains numerous areas without adhesion as well as\nadhesive areas differing greatly in tenacity values (range, 1.39-28.24 kPa).\nThe surface is readily wettable with water (contact angle, 31.9-36.0°C)\nand has a high surface free energy (56.84-61.93 mN m-1) with a\nrelatively high polar component (33.09-52.70 mN m-1). To examine\nthe effect of the glandular secretion on attachment systems of insects having\nhairy and smooth adhesive pads, forces generated on different surfaces by\nCalliphora vicina flies and Pyrrhocoris apterus bugs,\nrespectively, were measured. Flies attached equally well to both fresh and\nair-dried glandular surfaces whereas bugs generated a significantly lower\nforce on the fresh glandular surface compared with the air-dried one. It is\nassumed that the contribution of the glandular surface to insect retention,\ndue to its effect on insect attachment, differs depending on insect weight and\nthe type of insect attachment system. Surface anisotropy does not facilitate\neffective claw interlocking so that insects possessing only claws are probably\nnot able to cling to the glandular surface. However, stiffness of the pitcher\nwall material in the digestive zone can provide claw clinging via\npunching of the pitcher wall by claws. Small insects lacking pads may use\nadhesive areas on the plant surface to attach themselves, but such solitary\npoints with very strong adhesion possibly impede their overall locomotion and\nchance of escape. Pad-bearing insects are presumably able to attach to smooth\nparts of the glandular surface located between glands. High free surface\nenergy of the plant substrate may promote adhesion. Gland secretion may\ndecrease attachment ability in insects with smooth adhesive pads but not\ninfluence attachment of insects with hairy attachment systems."},{"title":"A crustacean nitric oxide synthase expressed in nerve ganglia, Y-organ,\ngill and gonad of the tropical land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/16/2845","abstract":"NO signaling is involved in many physiological processes in invertebrates.\nIn crustaceans, it plays a role in the regulation of the nervous system and\nmuscle contraction.

In a recent study, we reported single fibers from the\ncutter claw closer muscle of lobsters that demonstrated a gradation between\nthe slow-twitch (S1) and slow-tonic (S2) muscle\nphenotype. In the present study, we focused on S1 and S2\nfibers from the superficial abdominal muscles of the lobster as a model to\nstudy the continuum among muscle fiber types. Complementary DNAs (cDNA)\nencoding an S2 isoform of myosin heavy chain (MHC) and an\nS2 isoform of tropomyosin (Tm) were isolated from the superficial\nabdominal flexor muscles of adult lobsters. These identified sequences were\nused to design PCR primers used in conjunction with RT-PCR and real-time PCR\nto measure expression levels of these genes in small muscle samples and single\nfibers. The relative expression of the corresponding S1 MHC and\nS1 Tm isoforms was measured in the same samples with PCR primers\ndesigned according to previously identified sequences. In addition, we\nmeasured the relative proportions of MHC, troponin (Tn) T and I protein\nisoforms present in the same samples to examine the correlation of these\nproteins with one another and with the MHC and Tm mRNAs. These analyses\nrevealed significant correlations among the different myofibrillar proteins,\nwith the S1 and S2 fibers being characterized by a whole\nassemblage of myofibrillar isoforms.

The\nmain, long-wavelength band of the spectral sensitivities of the R3 and R4\nphotoreceptors is well described by the absorption spectrum of a visual\npigment with absorption maximum at 563 nm; i.e. PrL is a visual pigment R563.\nThe spectral sensitivities of R5–8 photoreceptors in ommatidial type I\nand III peak at 620 nm and those in type II ommatidia peak at 640 nm. The\nlarge shifts of the spectral sensitivities of the R5–8 photoreceptors\nwith respect to the absorption spectrum of their visual pigment can be\nexplained with the spectral filtering by pale-red (PR) and deep-red (DR)\nscreening pigments that are concentrated in clusters of granules near the\nrhabdom boundary.

A number of dynamic extracellular H+ fluxes\nwere measured along Rhodnius ovarioles, representing an oogenesis\ncycle, using a non-invasive, self-referencing, H+-selective probe.\nThe interfollicular stalk separating adjacent follicles exhibited prominent\nH+ efflux that peaked during midvitellogenesis and declined during\nlate vitellogenesis. H+ efflux in this region preceded stalk\nformation and, importantly, preceded the onset of vitellogenesis in the\nadjacent posterior follicle. H+ efflux was also observed over the\nterminal follicle, where specialized regions of the chorion were forming, and\nwas still detected around follicle cells after ovulation, indicating that the\nsomatic follicular epithelium produced this flux. Transmembrane H+\nfluxes may drive intracellular pH changes or may stabilize pHi in\nresponse to pH-altering events.

Two eurythermal fish species with different physiological strategies\nfor surviving in the cold, a cold-dormant crucian carp (Carassius\ncarassius L.) and a cold-active rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus\nmykiss), were used in acclimation experiments. The INa of carp\nand trout were also compared with INa of a cold stenothermal burbot\n(Lota lota). In accordance with the hypothesis, cold-acclimation\ndecreased the density of INa in crucian carp and increased it in\nrainbow trout, suggesting depression of impulse conduction in cold-acclimated\ncarp and positive compensation of impulse propagation in cold-acclimated\ntrout. The steady-state activation curve of trout INa was shifted\nby 6 mV to more negative voltages by cold acclimation, which probably lowers\nthe stimulus threshold for action potentials and further improves cardiac\nexcitability in the cold. In burbot myocytes, the INa density was\nhigh and the position of the steady-state activation curve on the voltage axis\nwas even more negative than in trout or carp myocytes, suggesting that the\nburbot INa is adapted to maintain high excitability and\nconductivity in the cold. The INa of the burbot heart differed from\nthose of carp and trout in causing four times larger charge influx per\nexcitation, which suggests that INa may also have a significant\nrole in cardiac excitation–contraction coupling of the burbot heart.

Survival of hatchlings was only about one third the life of their\nadult conspecifics in anoxic water. Much of the decrease in survival was\nattributable to a dramatically lower shell-bone content (44% ash in adult\npainted turtles vs. 3% ash in hatchlings of all three species) and a\nsmaller buffer content of bone (1.3 mmol g–1 CO2\nin adult painted turtles vs. 0.13–0.23 mmol\ng–1 CO2 in hatchlings of the three species).

These findings are consistent with the\nview that C-cells respond exclusively to serotonin, P-cells to serotonin and\ndopamine, and most duct cells only to dopamine.

Peak principal longitudinal\ntensile strains on the cranial surface and compressive strains on the caudal\nsurface of the radius increased during ontogeny but maintained a uniform\ndistribution, resulting in the radius being loaded primarily in bending\nthrough ontogeny. The increase in strain occurred despite uniform loading\n(relative to body weight) of the forelimb through ontogeny.

For rigid antennae\nset perpendicular to the water flow, measured drag increased with increasing\nswim speed. Increasing antenna length (for lengths between 100 and 200 mm) or\ndiameter (for diameters between 1 and 4 mm) resulted in accelerating increased\ndrag as a function of both antenna length and diameter. Where antennae were\npositioned at acute angles to the water flow, drag was markedly reduced, as\nwas drag at higher speeds in flexible antennae. These results were\nincorporated in a model on the foraging energetics of free-living Magellanic\npenguins using data (on swim speeds, intervals between prey encounters, amount\ningested per patch and dive durations) derived from previously published work\nand from a field study conducted on birds from a colony at Punta Norte,\nArgentina, using data loggers. The field work indicated that free-living birds\nhave a foraging efficiency (net energy gain/net energy loss) of about 2.5. The\nmodel predicted that birds equipped with the largest rigid external antennae\ntested (200 mm × 3 mm diameter), set perpendicular to water flow,\nincreased energy expenditure at normal swim speeds of 1.77 m\ns–1 by 79% and at prey capture speeds of 2.25 m\ns–1 by 147%, and ultimately led to a foraging efficiency that\nwas about 5 times less than that of unequipped birds.

To understand further the mechanisms involved in transforming\nlarval to adult tissue we have mapped the metamorphic changes in a\nparticularly well established brain area, the antennal lobe of the sphinx moth\nManduca sexta, using an antiserum recognizing RFamide-related\nneuropeptides. Five types of RFamide-immunoreactive (ir) neurons could be\ndistinguished in the antennal lobe, based on morphology and developmental\nappearance. Four cell types (types II–V, each consisting of one or two\ncells) showed RFamide immunostaining in the larva that persisted into\nmetamorphosis. By contrast, the most prominent group (type I), a mixed\npopulation of local and projection neurons consisting of about 60 neurons in\nthe adult antennal lobe, acquired immunostaining in a two-step process during\nmetamorphosis. In a first step, from 5 to 7 days after pupal ecdysis, the\nnumber of labeled neurons reached about 25. In a second step, starting about 4\ndays later, the number of RFamide-ir neurons increased within 6 days to about\n60. This two-step process parallels the rise and fall of the developmental\nhormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in the hemolymph. Artificially shifting the\n20E peak to an earlier developmental time point resulted in the precocious\nappearance of RFamide immunostaining and led to premature formation of\nglomeruli. Prolonging high 20E concentrations to stages when the hormone titer\nstarts to decline had no effect on the second increase of immunostained cell\nnumbers. These results support the idea that the rise in 20E, which occurs\nafter pupal ecdysis, plays a role in the first phase of RFamide expression and\nin glomeruli formation in the developing antennal lobes. The role of 20E in\nthe second phase of RFamide expression is less clear, but increased cell\nnumbers showing RFamide-ir do not appear to be a consequence of the declining\nlevels in 20E that occur during adult development."},{"title":"Switching destinations: memory change in wood ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/14/2401","abstract":"We have studied the changing use of spatial memories in wood ants by\ncharting how the ants' paths transform when ants are first trained to feed at\none site and must then switch to another site.

The details of this behaviour suggest that, after\nthe turn, control of the path switches from the snapshot recorded at the first\nfeeding site (or some combination of the two snapshots) to the snapshot\nrecorded at the second feeding site.

First, we determined whether the inverted pendulum (IP) mechanism of\nenergy exchange was present in toddlers. It seems that new walkers partially\nmake use of this energy saving mechanism, but it is less efficient than in\nadults. The reduced recovery values (R=40% at optimal speeds in\ntoddlers compared to 70% in adults) can be explained by their low\nself-selected walking speed in combination with their tossing gait (large\nvertical oscillations of the body) and by the observation that during as much\nas 25–50% of the gait cycle kinetic and potential energy are oscillating\nin-phase.The second step was to calculate positive external mechanical work\n(Wext). Since the IP mechanism is less efficient in\ntoddlers, more mass-specific positive work has to be performed to lift and\naccelerate the centre of mass than in adults walking at the same speed, even\nwhen differences in body size are taken into account.The amount of positive internal work (Wint,k) necessary\nto move the body segments relative to the centre of mass was the third\nparameter we calculated. In toddlers Wint,k is largely\ndetermined by the kinetic energy of the lower limb. Compared to adults,\ntoddlers have to perform less mass-specific work per unit distance to\naccelerate the body segments since the upper body is kept relatively stiff\nduring walking and there is no arm swing.Apart from work performed on the centre of mass and work performed to move\nthe body segments relative to the centre of mass, when walking some work is\nalso performed during double contact as both legs are pushing against each\nother. Two methods were used to calculate this amount of work, both leading to\nthe same conclusions. Mass-specific work during double contact is small in\ntoddlers compared to adults because of their low walking speed.Finally the total amount of mechanical work performed in toddlers was\ncompared to the work production observed in adults. Wext\nseems to be the major determinant for total mechanical energy expenditure. At\nintermediate froude numbers work production is comparable between adults and\ntoddlers, but at low and high froude numbers Wtot\nincreases due to the steep increases in Wext.

This pattern suggests that yolk androgens are costly to\nfemales. In this study, we experimentally manipulated adult female condition\nin zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata by modifying the level of\ndevelopmental stress they suffered as nestlings. This was achieved by\ncross-fostering nestlings to broods of varying brood size. Subsequently, we\nmeasured the yolk testosterone contents of the female offspring that resulted\nfrom the experimental manipulation. As predicted, females deposited decreasing\nconcentrations of testosterone with increasing brood sizes experienced as\nnestlings: testosterone concentration (mean ± s.e.m.) of\neggs laid by females from small broods, 20.66±2.08 pg\nmg–1; medium broods, 15.32±1.94 pg\nmg–1; and large broods, 14.51±1.66 pg\nmg–1. Additionally, testosterone concentration decreased with\nlaying order, and varied with clutch size in a complex way. Differences in egg\ntestosterone between females exposed to different brood sizes are in line with\nprevious findings in showing that early developmental stress can affect adult\nreproductive performance, although our study did not detect an effect in other\nbreeding parameters, such as latency to breed or clutch size. Furthermore, the\nresults are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a cost associated\nwith yolk testosterone. However, it is still unclear what the nature of this\ncost may be, and whether it is paid by females, offspring, or both."},{"title":"Environmental influence on testicular MAP kinase (ERK1) activity in the\nfrog Rana esculenta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/13/2209","abstract":"Recent studies suggest a role for ERK1 in the regulation of spermatogonial\nproliferation.

Three pairs of pocket gopher populations were used, with each\npair selected from a different subspecies and comprising one high genetic\nvariability and one low genetic variability population. Genetic variability\nwas measured using average allozyme heterozygosity and two measures of DNA\nfingerprint band sharing.

Our results indicate that the cost of\nburrowing was significantly higher in populations with lower genetic\nvariability (3-way ANCOVA, P=0.0150); mass-adjusted cost of burrowing\nin the low variability populations averaged 0.57±0.24 ml O2\ng–1 kgm–1 and that in the high variability\npopulations averaged 0.42±0.19 ml O2 g–1\nkgm–1.

The roles played\nby alterations in gene expression in enabling eurytherms to adjust to these\ntwo temporally distinct patterns of thermal stress are poorly understood. We\nused cDNA microarray analysis to examine changes in gene expression in a\neurythermal fish, Austrofundulus limnaeus, subjected to long-term\nacclimation to constant temperatures of 20, 26 and 37°C and to\nenvironmentally realistic daily fluctuations in temperature between 20°C\nand 37°C. Our data reveal major differences between the transcriptional\nresponses in the liver made during acclimation to constant temperatures and in\nresponse to daily temperature fluctuations. Control of cell growth and\nproliferation appears to be an important part of the response to change in\ntemperature, based on large-scale changes in mRNA transcript levels for\nseveral key regulators of these pathways. However, cell growth and\nproliferation appear to be regulated by different genes in constant\nversus fluctuating temperature regimes. The gene expression response\nof molecular chaperones is also different between constant and fluctuating\ntemperatures. Small heat shock proteins appear to play an important role in\nresponse to fluctuating temperatures whereas larger molecular mass chaperones\nsuch as Hsp70 and Hsp90 respond more strongly to chronic high temperatures. A\nnumber of transcripts that encode for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of\nnitrogen-containing organic osmolytes have gene expression patterns that\nindicate a possible role for these `chemical chaperones' during acclimation to\nchronic high temperatures and daily temperature cycling. Genes important for\nthe maintenance of membrane integrity are highly responsive to temperature\nchange. Changes in fatty acid saturation may be important in long-term\nacclimation and in response to fluctuating temperatures; however cholesterol\nmetabolism may be most critical for short-term acclimation to fluctuating\ntemperatures. The variable effect of temperature on the expression of genes\nwith daily rhythms of expression indicates that there is a complex interaction\nbetween the temperature cycle and daily rhythmicity in gene expression. A\nnumber of new hypotheses concerning temperature acclimation in fish have been\ngenerated as a result of this study. The most notable of these hypotheses is\nthe possibility that the high mobility group b1 (HMGB1) protein, which plays\nkey roles in the assembly of transcription initiation and enhanceosome\ncomplexes, may act as a compensatory modulator of transcription in response to\ntemperature, and thus as a global gene expression temperature sensor.

In O. taeniorhynchus, pupal mass, larval stage\nduration and growth rates (dry mass) increase with salinity, whereas growth\nrates (wet mass) remain constant across salinities, reflecting a decrease in\npercent body water.

We hypothesized that\nmechanical work output of the LG and PL during running parallels the demand\nfor mechanical work on the body. The turkeys ran on level, inclined (+6°,\n+12°) and declined (–6°, –12°) treadmills to change\nthe demand for mechanical work. Simultaneous measurements of muscle length\n(from sonomicrometry) and muscle force (from tendon strain gauges) were used\nto calculate mechanical work output.During level running at a speed of 2 m s–1, the LG and PL\nwere both active in stance but produced peak force at different times, at\napproximately 21% of stance duration for the LG and 70% for the PL. The LG and\nPL also had different length patterns in stance during level running. The LG\nunderwent little shortening during force production, resulting in negligible\nnet positive work (2.0±0.8 J kg–1). By contrast, the\nPL produced force across a stretch–shorten cycle in stance and did\nsignificant net positive work (4.7±1.6 J kg–1). Work\noutputs for both the LG and PL were directly proportional to running slope.\nWhen we increased the demand for net positive work by running the turkeys on\nan incline, the LG and PL increased stance net positive work output in direct\nproportion to slope (P<0.05). Stance net positive work output\nincreased to 7.0±1.3 J kg–1 for the LG and\n8.1±2.9 J kg–1 for the PL on the steepest incline.\nIncreases in stance net positive work for the LG and PL were associated with\nincreases in net shortening strain and average shortening velocity, but\naverage force in stance remained constant. The LG and PL muscles were also\neffective energy absorbers during decline running, when there is demand for\nnet negative work on the body. During decline running at 2 m\ns–1 on the steepest slope, the LG absorbed 4.6±2.2 J\nkg–1 of net work in stance and the PL absorbed 2.4±0.9\nJ kg–1 of net work. Shifts in muscle mechanical function from\nenergy production during incline running to energy absorption during decline\nrunning were observed over a range of running speeds from 1–3 m\ns–1 for both the LG and PL.Two fundamentally different mechanisms for changing work output were\napparent in the mechanical behavior of the LG and PL. The LG simply altered\nits length pattern; it actively shortened during incline running to produce\nmechanical energy and actively lengthened during decline running to absorb\nmechanical energy. The PL changed mechanical function by altering its length\npattern and by shifting the timing of force production across its\nstretch–shorten cycle. During incline running, the PL produced force\nduring late stance shortening for positive work, but during decline running,\nthe timing of force production shifted into early stance, to align with\nlengthening for negative work. In addition, during decline running, the PL\ngreatly reduced or eliminated late stance shortening, thus reducing the\npotential for positive work.Our results show that the changing demands for whole body work during\nsteady speed running are met, at least in part, by an ability of single\nmuscles to shift mechanical function from net energy production to net energy\nabsorption."},{"title":"Temperature-dependent oxygen limitation in insect eggs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/13/2267","abstract":"Most terrestrial insect embryos support metabolism with oxygen from the\nenvironment by diffusion across the eggshell.

The\naccelerations fit a model of drag, air buoyancy and tissue buoyancy forces\nwith an r2 of 99.1–99.8% for each whale. The model\nprovided estimates (mean ± s.d.) of the drag coefficient\n(0.00306±0.00015), air carried from the surface (26.4±3.9 l\nkg-3 mass), and tissue density (1030±0.8 kg m-3)\nof these five animals. The model predicts strong positive buoyancy forces in\nthe top 100 m of the water column, decreasing to near neutral buoyancy at\n250–850 m. Mean descent speeds (1.45±0.19 m s-1) were\nslower than ascent speeds (1.63±0.22 m s-1), even though\nsperm whales stroked steadily (glides 5.3±6.3%) throughout descents and\nemployed predominantly stroke-and-glide swimming (glides 37.7±16.4%)\nduring ascents. Whales glided more during portions of dives when buoyancy\naided their movement, and whales that glided more during ascent glided less\nduring descent (and vice versa), supporting the hypothesis that\nbuoyancy influences behavioural swimming decisions. One whale rested at∼\n10 m depth for more than 10 min without fluking, regulating its buoyancy\nby releasing air bubbles."},{"title":"The use of power spectral analysis to determine cardiorespiratory control\nin the short-horned sculpin Myoxocephalus scorpius","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/11/1969","abstract":"Anaesthesia and minor surgery to place electrocardiogram recording\nelectrodes in the short-horned sculpin caused a decrease in mean normal beat\n(R–R) interval and heart rate variability (HRV), measured as the\nstandard deviation in the R–R interval (SDRR).

We examined whether imperial cormorants\nPhalacrocorax atriceps adhere to this by examining dive:pause ratios\nin birds diving for extended, continuous periods to constant depths, assuming\nthat the oxygen used underwater was exactly replenished by the periods at the\nsurface. Examination of the cumulative time spent in surface pauses relative\nto the cumulative time spent in diving showed that surface pauses increase\naccording to a power curve function of time spent in the dive or water depth.\nIn a simplistic model we considered the rate at which birds expended energy\nunderwater to be constant and that the rate of oxygen replenishment during the\nsurface pause was directly proportional to the oxygen deficit. We then worked\nout values for the rate constant for the surface pause before using this\nconstant to examine bird body oxygen levels immediately pre- and post dive.\nThe model predicted that imperial cormorants do not submerge with just enough\noxygen to cover their projected dive performance but rather dive with\nsubstantial reserves, although these reserves decrease with increasing dive\ndepth/duration. We speculate that these oxygen reserves may be used to enhance\nbird survival when rare events, such as the appearance of predators or\ndiscovery of large prey requiring extended handling time, occur. The form of\nthe oxygen saturation curve over time at the surface means that the time costs\nfor maintaining constant oxygen reserves become particularly onerous for long,\ndeep dives, so the observed decrease in reserves with increasing dive duration\nis expected in animals benefiting by optimizing for time."},{"title":"Preservation of reproductive behaviors during modest cooling: rapid cold-hardening fine-tunes organismal response","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/11/1797","abstract":"The primary objectives of this study were to determine (1) whether rapid\ncold-hardening (RCH) preserves reproductive behaviors during modest cooling,\n(2) whether increased mating success at a lower temperature comes at the cost\nof decreased performance at a higher temperature and (3) whether RCH is\nassociated with an elevated metabolic rate.

We\nperformed high-resolution particle image velocimetry (PIV) to quantify the\nwake structure, measure the swimming efficiency, and force and power output.\nThe wake consists of jets of fluid that point almost directly laterally,\nseparated by an unstable shear layer that rolls up into two or more vortices\nover time. Previously, the wake of swimming eels was hypothesized to consist\nof unlinked vortex rings, resulting from a phase offset between vorticity\ndistributed along the body and vorticity shed at the tail. Our high-resolution\nflow data suggest that the body anterior to the tail tip produces relatively\nlow vorticity, and instead the wake structure results from the instability of\nthe shear layers separating the lateral jets, reflecting pulses of high\nvorticity shed at the tail tip. We compare the wake structure to\nlarge-amplitude elongated body theory and to a previous computational fluid\ndynamic model and note several discrepancies between the models and the\nmeasured values. The wake of steadily swimming eels differs substantially in\nstructure from the wake of previously studied carangiform fishes in that it\nlacks any significant downstream flow, previously interpreted as signifying\nthrust. We infer that the lack of downstream flow results from a spatial and\ntemporal balance of momentum removal (drag) and thrust generated along the\nbody, due to the relatively uniform shape of eels. Carangiform swimmers\ntypically have a narrow caudal peduncle, which probably allows them to\nseparate thrust from drag both spatially and temporally.

The increase in apoptotic\nchloride cells at salinities greater than 55 g l–1, prior to\nchanges in physiological and biochemical parameters, indicates that it may be\nthe most sensitive indicator of osmoregulatory stress. Oxygen consumption\ndecreased with salinity, indicating a reduction in activity level at high\nsalinity. Finally, `California' Mozambique tilapia have a salinity tolerance\nsimilar to that of pure Mozambique tilapia; however, cellular necrosis at 95 g\nl–1 indicates they may be unable to withstand extreme\nsalinities for extended periods of time."},{"title":"Effect of serotonin on ciliary beating and intracellular calcium concentration in identified populations of embryonic ciliary cells","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/8/1415","abstract":"Embryos of the pond snail Helisoma trivolvis express three known\nsubtypes of ciliary cells on the surface of the embryo early in development:\npedal, dorsolateral and scattered single ciliary cells (SSCCs). The pedal and\ndorsolateral ciliary cells are innervated by a pair of serotonergic\nsensory-motor neurons and are responsible for generating the earliest\nwhole-animal behavior, rotation within the egg capsule. Previous cell culture\nstudies on unidentified ciliary cells revealed that serotonin\n(5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) produces a significant increase in the ciliary\nbeat frequency (CBF) in a large proportion of ciliary cells. Both\nCa2+ influx and a unique isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) were\nimplicated in the signal transduction pathway underlying the cilio-excitatory\nresponse to 5-HT. The goal of the present study was to characterize the\nanatomical and physiological differences between the three known populations\nof superficial ciliary cells. The pedal and dorsolateral ciliary cells shared\ncommon structural characteristics, including flat morphology, dense cilia and\nlateral accessory ciliary rootlets. By contrast, the SSCCs had a cuboidal\nmorphology, reduced number of cilia, increased ciliary length and absence of\nlateral accessory rootlets. In cultures containing unidentified ciliary cells,\nthe calcium/calmodulin-dependent enzyme inhibitor calmidazolium (2 μmol\nl–1) blocked the stimulatory effect of 5-HT (100 μmol\nl–1) on CBF. In addition, 50% of unidentified cultured cells\nresponded to 5-HT (100 μmol l–1) with an increase in\n[Ca2+]i. To facilitate the functional analyses of the\nindividual populations, we developed a method to culture identified ciliary\nsubtypes and characterized their ciliary and calcium responses to 5-HT. In\ncultures containing either pedal or dorsolateral ciliary cells, 5-HT (100μ\nmol l–1) produced a rapid increase in CBF and a slower\nincrease in [Ca2+]i in all cells examined. By contrast,\nthe CBF and [Ca2+]i of SSCCs were not affected by 100μ\nmol l–1 5-HT. Immunohistochemistry for two putative 5-HT\nreceptors recently cloned from Helisoma revealed that pedal and\ndorsolateral ciliary cells consistently express the 5-HT1Hel\nprotein. Intense 5-HT7Hel immunoreactivity was observed in only a\nsubset of pedal and dorsolateral ciliary cells. Cells neighboring the SSCCs,\nbut not the ciliary cells themselves, expressed 5-HT1Hel and\n5-HT7Hel immunoreactivity. These data suggest that the pedal and\ndorsolateral ciliary cells, but not the SSCCs are a homogeneous physiological\nsubtype that will be useful for elucidating the signal transduction mechanisms\nunderlying 5-HT induced cilio-excitation."},{"title":"The occurrence of two types of hemopexin-like protein in medaka and differences in their affinity to heme","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/8/1387","abstract":"Full-length cDNA clones encoding two types of hemopexin-like protein,\nmWap65-1 and mWap65-2, were isolated from the HNI inbred line of medaka\nOryzias latipes.

Vertical orientation tends to reduce blood flow and\npressure in the head for two major reasons. First, the increased vertical\nblood column above the heart creates a gravitational hydrostatic pressure\nagainst which the heart must work. Second, expansion of dependent vessels in\nthe lower extremities causes blood pooling and reduces return of venous blood\nto the heart, thereby lowering flow and pressure. For most animals, it is\ndifficult to separate these two effects, but snakes offer the possibility of\nbending the animal in the region of the heart and manipulating the two ends of\nthe body independently. We studied baroregulatory responses in terrestrial\npythons (Liasis fuscus) and aquatic file snakes (Acrochordus\narafurae) by tilting only the front or rear parts and then the whole\nanimal. Changes in head blood pressure during partial tilts added up to the\nchange during full tilt.

The flapping motion consisted of translation and rotation [the\ntranslation velocity (ut) varied according to the simple\nharmonic function (SHF), and the rotation was confined to a short period\naround stroke reversal]. First, it was shown that for a wing of given geometry\nwith ut varying as the SHF, the aerodynamic force\ncoefficients depended only on five non-dimensional parameters, i.e. Reynolds\nnumber (Re), stroke amplitude (Φ), mid-stroke angle of attack\n(αm), non-dimensional duration of wing rotation\n(Δτr) and rotation timing [the mean translation velocity\nat radius of the second moment of wing area (U), the mean chord\nlength (c) and c/U were used as reference velocity, length\nand time, respectively]. Next, the force coefficients were investigated for a\ncase in which typical values of these parameters were used (Re=200;Φ\n=150°; αm=40°; Δτr was 20%\nof wingbeat period; rotation was symmetrical). Finally, the effects of varying\nthese parameters on the force coefficients were investigated.In the Re range considered (20–1800), when Re was\nabove ∼100, the lift\n(C̄L) and drag\n(C̄D) coefficients were\nlarge and varied only slightly with Re (in agreement with results\npreviously published for revolving wings); the large force coefficients were\nmainly due to the delayed stall mechanism. However, when Re was below∼\n100, C̄L decreased and\nC̄D increased greatly. At\nsuch low Re, similar to the case of higher Re, the leading\nedge vortex existed and attached to the wing in the translatory phase of a\nhalf-stroke; but it was very weak and its vorticity rather diffused, resulting\nin the small C̄L and large\nC̄D. Comparison of the\ncalculated results with available hovering flight data in eight species\n(Re ranging from 13 to 1500) showed that when Re was above∼\n100, lift equal to insect weight could be produced but when Re\nwas lower than ∼100, additional high-lift mechanisms were needed.In the range of Re above ∼100, Φ from 90° to 180°\nand Δτr from 17% to 32% of the stroke period (symmetrical\nrotation), the force coefficients varied only slightly with Re, Φ\nand Δτr. This meant that the forces were approximately\nproportional to the square of Φn (n is the wingbeat\nfrequency); thus, changing Φ and/or n could effectively control\nthe magnitude of the total aerodynamic force.The time course of C̄L\n(or C̄D) in a half-stroke\nfor ut varying according to the SHF resembled a half\nsine-wave.

By contrast, during\nquadrupedal gallops by both species, the trunk pitched on a stabilized head.\nDuring both gaits in both species, head and trunk pitch rotations were\nsymmetrical about comparable mean positions in both gaits, with mean head\nposition aligning the horizontal semicircular canals near earth horizontal.\nHead pitch direction countered head vertical displacement direction to varying\ndegrees during walks and only intermittently during gallops, providing\nevidence that correctional head pitch rotations are not essential for gaze\nstabilization. Head-to-space pitch velocities were below 350 deg.\ns–1, the threshold above which, at least among humans, the\nvestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) becomes saturated. Mean peak frequencies of\nvertical translations and pitch rotations of the head ranged from 1 Hz to 2\nHz, a lower frequency range than that in which inertia is predicted to be the\nmajor stabilizer of the head in these species. Some variables, which were\ncommon to both walks and gallops in both species, are likely to reflect\nconstraints in sensorimotor control. Other variables, which differed between\nthe two gaits in both species, are likely to reflect kinematic differences,\nwhereas variables that differed between the two species are attributed\nprimarily to morphological and behavioural differences. It is concluded that\neither the head or the trunk can provide the nervous system with a reference\nframe for spatial orientation and that the segment providing that reference\ncan change, depending upon the kinematic characteristics of the chosen\ngait."},{"title":"A three-dimensional kinematic analysis of tongue flicking in Python\nmolurus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/5/827","abstract":"The forked snake tongue is a muscular organ without hard skeletal support.\nA functional interpretation of the variable arrangement of the intrinsic\nmuscles along the tongue requires a quantitative analysis of the motion\nperformance during tongue protrusion and flicking.

Finally, the structure was examined by carrying out scanning\nelectron microscopy of free fracture surfaces and polarized light microscopy\nof nail sections.When nails were torn, cracks were always diverted transversely, parallel to\nthe free edge of the nail. Cutting tests showed that this occurred because the\nenergy to cut nails transversely, at approximately 3 kJ m–2,\nwas about half that needed (approx. 6 kJ m–2) to cut them\nlongitudinally. This anisotropy was imparted by the thick intermediate layer,\nwhich comprises long, narrow cells that are oriented transversely; the energy\nneeded to cut this layer transversely was only a quarter of that needed to cut\nit longitudinally. In contrast the tile-like cells in the thinner dorsal and\nventral layers showed isotropic behaviour.

P. schlosseri could lower the pH of 50\nvolumes (w/v) of 50% seawater in an artificial burrow from pH 8.2 to pH 7.4 in\n1 day, and established an ambient ammonia concentration of 10 mmol\nl-1 in 8 days. It could alter the rate of titratable acid efflux in\nresponse to ambient pH. The rate of net acid efflux (H+ excretion)\nin P. schlosseri was pH-dependent, increasing in the order pH\n6.0<7.0<8.0<8.5. Net acid flux in neutral or alkaline pH conditions\nwas partially inhibited by bafilomycin, indicating the possible involvement of\na V-type H+-ATPase. P. schlosseri could also increase the\nrate of H+ excretion in response to the presence of ammonia in a\nneutral (pH 7.0) external medium. Increased H+ excretion in P.\nschlosseri occurred in the head region where active excretion of\nNH4+ took place. This would result in high\nconcentrations of H+ in the boundary water layer and prevent the\ndissociation of NH4+, thus preventing a back flux of\nNH3 through the branchial epithelia. P. schlosseri\nprobably developed such an `environmental ammonia detoxification' capability\nbecause of its unique behavior of burrow building in the mudflats and living\ntherein in a limited volume of water. In addition, the skin of P.\nschlosseri had low permeability to NH3. Using an Ussing-type\napparatus with 10 mmol l-1 NH4Cl and a 1 unit pH\ngradient (pH 8.0 to 7.0), the skin supported only a very small flux of\nNH3 (0.0095 μmol cm-2 min-1).

Phosphatidylcholine, which has a stabilizing effect on\nmembranes, constituted almost 50% of the skin phospholipids, with\nphosphatidyleserine and phsophatidylethanolamine contributing only 13% and\n15%, respectively. More importantly, P. schlosseri increased the\ncholesterol level (to 5.5 μmol g-1) and altered the fatty acid\ncomposition (increased total saturated fatty acid content) in its skin lipid\nafter exposure to ammonia (30 mmol l-1 at pH 7.0) for 6 days.

Assuming that polarotactic water insects\ninterpret a surface as representing water if the degree of linear polarization\nof reflected light is higher than a threshold and the deviation of the\ndirection of polarization from the horizontal is lower than a threshold, we\ncalculated the proportion, P, of the artificial surfaces detected\npolarotactically as water. We found that at sunrise and sunset P is\nmaximal for both water-dummies and their reflection-polarizational\ncharacteristics are most similar. From this, we conclude that polarotactic\nwater detection is easiest at low solar elevations, because the risk that a\npolarotactic insect will be unable to recognize the surface of a dark or\nbright water body is minimal. This partly explains why many aquatic insect\nspecies usually fly en masse at dusk. The daily change in the\nreflection-polarization pattern of water surfaces is an important visual\necological factor that may contribute to the preference of the twilight period\nfor habitat searching by polarotactic water insects.

Metabolism remains elevated for many days, while digestion\nproceeds, resulting in considerable investment of time and energy. Snakes\nactively adjust thermoregulatory behavior to raise their body temperature\nduring digestion, exhibiting a post-prandial thermophilic response that\naccelerates digestion at the expense of higher metabolic rates. In the present\nstudy, we investigated the possibility that endogenously derived heat,\noriginating as a byproduct of the post-prandial increase in metabolism, could\nitself contribute to the elevated body temperature during digestion in the\nSouth American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus. We assessed heat\nproduction, at a constant environmental temperature, by taking infrared (IR)\nimages of snakes during fasting and after being fed meals varying from 10% to\n50% of their own body masses. Our results show clearly that digesting\nrattlesnakes have significantly increased body temperatures, even when\nprecluded from adjusting their thermoregulatory behavior. The feeding-derived\nthermogenesis caused the surface body temperature of rattlesnakes to increase\nby 0.9–1.2°C, a temperature change that will significantly affect\ndigestive performance. The alterations in body temperature following feeding\ncorrelated closely with the temporal profile of changes in post-prandial\nmetabolism. Moreover, the magnitude of the thermogenesis was greater for\nsnakes fed large meals, as was the corresponding metabolic response. Since IR\nimaging only assesses surface temperatures, the magnitude of the thermogenesis\nand the changes in deep core temperature could be even more pronounced than is\nreported here."},{"title":"Electrogenic proton-regulated oxalate/chloride exchange by lobster hepatopancreatic brush-border membrane vesicles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/4/571","abstract":"The transport of [14C]oxalate (Ox2–) by\nepithelial brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) of lobster (Homarus\namericanus) hepatopancreas, formed by a magnesium precipitation\ntechnique, was stimulated by an outward Cl– gradient (in >\nout). By contrast, Ox2– uptake was not enhanced by an inward\nNa+ or K+ transmembrane gradient.

Female emus provisioned larger eggs\nwith a greater absolute amount of energy, nutrients and water in the yolk and\nalbumen. Variation in maternal investment was reflected in differences in\nhatchling size, which increased isometrically with egg size.

Food-free, normoxic conditions resulted\nin maximum appendage beating rates (fa) and half-maximum\nheart rates (fh), which restricted the scope for\noxyregulation to the circulatory system. Food-rich conditions (105\nalgal cells ml-1), on the contrary, had a depressing effect on\nfa whereas fh increased to 83% of the\nmaximum. In this physiological state, D. magna was able to respond to\nprogressive hypoxia with a compensatory increase in ventilation. A conceptual\nand mathematical model was developed to analyse the efficiency of ventilatory\nand circulatory adjustments in improving oxygen transport to tissue. Model\npredictions showed that an increase in perfusion rate was most effective under\nboth food-free and food-rich conditions in reducing the critical ambient\noxygen tension (PO2crit) at which oxygen supply\nto the tissue started to become impeded. By contrast, a hypothetical increase\nin ventilation rate had almost no effect on\nPO2crit under food-free conditions, indicating\nthat appendage movement is driven by nutritive rather than respiratory\nrequirements. However, the model predicted a moderate reduction of\nPO2crit by hyperventilation under food-rich\nconditions. Since the regulatory scope for an adjustment in\nfh was found to be limited in D. magna under\nthese conditions, the increase in ventilation rate is the means of choice for\na fed animal to cope with short-term, moderate reductions in ambient oxygen\navailability.

OHSS was purified, and its\nactive form had a molecular mass of 25 kDa. The cDNA of OHSS cloned from an\nembryonic cDNA library was 1759 bp long, encoding 492 amino acids in a single\nopen reading frame (ORF). The C-terminal part of the predicted protein was\ncomposed of a trypsin-like serine protease domain, with homology to\ncounterparts in other animals of 33–38%. The predicted protein (54.7\nkDa) secreted as a zymogen may be cleaved post-translationally, separating the\nC-terminal from the N-terminal region. The OHSS gene was expressed in the\nembryo at least 2 weeks before hatching. Expression was also detected in the\nzoea larva 1 day after hatching and in the brain of the female. However, it\nwas not detected in the muscle, hepatopancreas or ovigerous seta of the\nfemale. Ultrastructural analysis indicated that the material investing\nmaternal ovigerous hair, i.e. the outermost layer (E1) of the egg case, is\nattached at the special sites (attachment sites) arranged at intervals of\n130–160 nm on the hair.

In\nthis study, we examine patterns of beak gape during song production in seven\nspecies of Darwin's finches of the Galápagos Islands. Our principal\ngoals were to characterize the relationship between beak gape and vocal\nfrequency during song production and to explore the possible influence therein\nof diversity in beak morphology and body size. Birds were audio and video\nrecorded (at 30 frames s–1) as they sang in the field, and\n164 song sequences were analyzed. We found that song frequency regressed\nsignificantly and positively on beak gape for 38 of 56 individuals and for all\nseven species examined. This finding provides broad support for a resonance\nmodel of vocal tract function in Darwin's finches. Comparison among species\nrevealed significant variation in regression y-intercept values. Body\nsize correlated negatively with y-intercept values, although not at a\nstatistically significant level.

Joint moment, power and work were\ndetermined for the metatarsophalangeal (MP), tarsal (ankle), tibiofemoral\n(knee) and coxofemoral (hip) joints. The hip, knee and ankle all flexed and\nthen extended and the MP extended and then flexed during ground contact.\nConsistent with our hypothesis, large extensor moments were observed at the\nhip and ankle joints and large flexor moments at the knee and MP joints\nthroughout ground contact of the hind limb. Peak moments tended to occur\nearlier in stance in the proximal joints but peak power generation of the hind\nlimb joints occurred at similar times except for the MP joint, with the hip\nand ankle peaking first followed by the MP joint.

In all cases, the computed drag compares well\nwith the experiments. The computed lift agrees in the cases in which the\nsinusoidal changes in angle of attack are symmetrical or advanced with respect\nto stroke positions, but lags behind the measured 3D lift in the delayed\ncase.In the range of amplitudes studied here, 3–5 chords, the force\ncoefficients have a weak dependence on stroke amplitude.

This\ndependence on amplitude and phase suggests a simple maneuver strategy that\ncould be used by a flapping wing device.In all cases the unsteady forces quickly reach an almost periodic state\nwith continuous flapping. The fluid forces are dominated by the pressure\ncontribution. The force component directly proportional to the linear\nacceleration is smaller by a factor proportional to the ratio of wing\nthickness and stroke amplitude; its net contribution is zero in hovering. The\nratio of wing inertia and fluid force is proportional to the product of the\nratio of wing and fluid density and the ratio of wing thickness and stroke\namplitude; it is negligible in the robotic wing experiment, but need not be in\ninsect flight.To identify unsteady effects associated with wing acceleration, and\ncoupling between rotation and translation, as well as wake capture, we examine\nthe difference between the unsteady forces and the estimates based on\ntranslational velocities, and compare them against the estimate of the\ncoupling between rotation and translation, which have simple analytic forms\nfor sinusoidal motions. The agreement and disagreement between the computed\nforces and experiments offer further insight into when the 3D effects are\nimportant.A main difference between a 3D revolving wing and a 2D translating wing is\nthe absence of vortex shedding by a revolving wing over a distance much longer\nthan the typical stroke length of insects. No doubt such a difference in\nshedding dynamics is responsible in part for the differences in steady\nstate force coefficients measured in 2D and 3D. On the other hand, it is\nunclear whether such differences would have a significant effect on transient\nforce coefficients before the onset of shedding. While the 2D steady state\nforce coefficients underpredict 3D forces, the transient 2D forces measured\nprior to shedding are much closer to the 3D forces. In the cases studied here,\nthe chord is moving between 3 to 5 chords, typical of hovering insect stroke\nlength, and the flow does not appear to separate during each stroke in the\ncases of advanced and symmetrical rotation. In these cases, the wing reverses\nbefore the leading edge vortex would have time to separate even in 2D. This\nsuggests that the time scale for flow separation in these strokes is dictated\nby the flapping frequency, which is dimensionally independent. In such cases,\nthe 2D unsteady forces turn out to be good approximations of 3D\nexperiments."},{"title":"Acoustic communication in noise: regulation of call characteristics in a New World monkey","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/3/443","abstract":"This study on common marmosets Callithrix jacchus is the first to\nexamine noise-dependent mechanisms of vocal plasticity in a New World monkey.\nSince acoustic communication can be considerably impaired by environmental\nnoise, some animals have evolved adaptations to counteract its masking\neffects. The studied marmosets increased the sound level of their spontaneous\ncalls in response to increased levels of white noise broadcast to them.\nPossibly, such noise-dependent adjustment of vocal amplitude serves to\nmaintain a specific signal-to-noise ratio that is favourable for signal\nproduction. Concurrently, the adjustment of vocal amplitude can maintain a\ngiven active space for communication. In contrast to some bird species, no\nnoise-induced increase in the number of syllables per call series could be\nfound, showing that an increased serial redundancy of vocal signals was not\nused to communicate under noisy conditions. Finally, we examined a possible\nnoise-dependent prolongation of vocal signals. This approach was guided by the\nfindings of perceptional studies, which suggest an increased detection\nprobability of prolonged signals in noise by temporal summation. Marmosets\nindeed increased the duration of their call syllables along with increasing\nbackground noise levels.

Although S-shaped movements are produced in both feeding and\nescape, kinematics and electromyogram (EMG) patterns differ. Stage 1\n(pre-propulsive movement) is significantly slower and more variable during\nfeeding strikes and involves caudal bending with less rostral movement than\nrecorded for startle behaviors. Correspondingly, there is strong caudal muscle\nactivity prior to rostral activity during strikes, whereas in startles caudal\nmuscle activity had near simultaneous onset with contralateral rostral\nactivity. Onset of jaw muscle activity occurred significantly after the onset\nof axial muscle activity during feeding strikes.

The Triakis UT mRNA is abundantly expressed in the\nkidney, while low levels of expression were detected in the brain and liver.\nIn the dogfish kidney, each nephron makes four turns and traverses repeatedly\nbetween bundle zone and sinus zone. In the bundle zone, the resulting five\ntubular segments are arranged in a countercurrent loop fashion.\nImmunohistochemistry using specific antibodies raised against the cloned UT\nrevealed that, among the nephron segments, the UT is expressed exclusively in\nthe final segment of the bundle zone, i.e. in the collecting tubule of the\nTriakis kidney. In contrast to the limited localization of UT, the\ntransport enzyme Na+/K+-ATPase is distributed in the\nbasolateral membrane of numerous tubular segments both in the sinus zone and\nthe bundle zone.

We have quantified the\neffects of acute temperature change and thermal acclimation on actin-based\nkeratocyte movement in primary cultures of keratocytes from four species of\nteleost fish adapted to widely different thermal conditions: two eurythermal\nspecies, the longjaw mudsucker Gillichthys mirabilis (environmental\ntemperature range of approximately 10-37°C) and a desert pupfish,\nCyprinodon salinus (10-40°C), and two species from stable thermal\nenvironments, an Antarctic notothenioid, Trematomus bernacchii\n(-1.86°C), and a tropical clownfish, Amphiprion percula\n(26-30°C). For all species, keratocyte speed increased with increasing\ntemperature. G. mirabilis and C. salinus keratocytes reached\nmaximal speeds at 25°C and 35°C, respectively, temperatures within the\nspecies' normal thermal ranges. Keratocytes of the stenothermal species\ncontinued to increase in speed as temperature increased above the species'\nnormal temperature ranges. The thermal limits of keratocyte motility appear to\nexceed those of whole-organism thermal tolerance, notably in the case of\nT. bernacchii. Keratocytes of T. bernacchii survived\nsupercooling to -6°C and retained motility at temperatures as high as\n20°C. Mean keratocyte speed was conserved at physiological temperatures\nfor the three temperate and tropical species, which suggests that a certain\nrate of motility is advantageous for wound healing. However, there was no\ntemperature compensation in speed of movement for keratocytes of the Antarctic\nfish, which have extremely slow rates of movement at physiological\ntemperatures. Keratocytes from all species moved in a persistent,\nunidirectional manner at low temperatures but at higher temperatures began to\ntake more circular or less-persistent paths. Thermal acclimation affected the\npersistence and turning magnitude of keratocytes, with warmer acclimations\ngenerally yielding more persistent cells that followed straighter paths.\nHowever, acclimation did not alter the effect of experimental temperature on\ncellular speed.

We investigated\nwhether the animals were using their hindlimbs for propulsion, rather than for\nsome other function (e.g. to maintain balance), by measuring ground reaction\nforces (GRF) during bouts of WAIR. Estimates of the contribution of the\nhindlimbs towards the vertical external work done by the bird were\n98±8% of the total at an incline of 60° (the steepest angle that\nbirds were able to negotiate without the use of their forelimbs). During\nvertical (90°) bouts of WAIR the hindlimb contribution was 37±5% of\nthe total external work. Yet, the magnitude of the peak GRF at 90° was\n175% of the value generated during level walking, revealing that birds engaged\nin WAIR do generate sizeable hindlimb forces even during vertical ascents.\nThese data support the hypothesis that forelimbs are enabling hindlimb\nfunction, and we argue that this represents a locomotor strategy which may\nhave been used by proto-birds during the evolution of flight."},{"title":"Na+/K+-ATPase α-isoform switching in gills of\nrainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during salinity transfer","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/24/4475","abstract":"We identified five Na+/K+-ATPase α-isoforms in\nrainbow trout and characterized their expression pattern in gills following\nseawater transfer.

We describe the natural feeding\nexcursions of path-integrating fiddler crabs and analyze their paths for signs\nof significant systematic or random navigation errors. No signs of any\nsystematic errors are evident. Random errors are small, probably due to a\ncombination of the short length and low sinuosity of the foraging paths, as\nwell as the fiddler crabs' unique method of locomotion that allows them to\nremain oriented to their burrows throughout the foraging path and to minimize\nlarge body turns. We further examined the extent to which their body\norientation during foraging (transverse body axis pointing more or less\ntowards home) accurately represented their stored home vector. By examining\nsequences of fast escape, we have shown that crabs can correct for deviations\nof their transverse body axis from home during their escape path. Thus their\nstored home vector is independent of their moment-to-moment body\norientation.Crabs were subjected to passive translational displacements and barrier\nobstructions. Responses to translational displacements were identical to those\nobserved by previous authors, namely that crabs returned in the correct\negocentric direction and distance as though no displacement had occurred.\nCovering the burrow entrance resulted in crabs returning to the correct\nposition of the burrow, and then beginning to search.

Therefore, other\nenergy-consuming physiological mechanisms must be responsible for the\nremaining unexplained variation in elevated laying RMR. Yolk precursor\n[vitellogenin (VTG) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)] production is\nlikely to be costly because it signifies a marked increase in the biosynthetic\nactivity of the liver.

This study investigates\nthe sources of directional and distance information used by these crabs when\nreturning to their burrows. We tested the spatial frame of reference\n(egocentric or exocentric), and the source of spatial information (idiothetic\nor allothetic) used during homing. We also tested which components of their\nlocomotion they integrated (only voluntary, or voluntary plus reflexive).Fiddler crabs in their natural mudflat habitat were passively rotated\nduring normal foraging behavior using experimenter-controlled disks, before\nthey returned home. Crabs resisted passive rotations on the disk by\ncounter-rotating when the disk turned, which was a compensatory response to\nunintended movement. Crabs were usually situated eccentrically on the disk,\nand therefore were also subjected to a translation when the disk rotated. No\ncrab actively compensated for this translation. Crabs that fully compensated\nfor disk rotation made no directional homing error. Crabs that did not fully\ncompensate homed in a direction that reflected their new body orientation. In\nother words, if we succeeded in reorienting a crab (i.e. it undercompensated\nfor disk rotation), its homing error was equal to the angle by which it had\nbeen reoriented, regardless of the magnitude of the optomotor\ncompensation.Computer-modelled crabs, each equipped with a path integrator utilizing\ndifferent combinations of external (allothetic) and path-related (idiothetic)\ninput, traversed the digitized paths of the real crabs. The home vector\ncomputed by the model crab was then compared to the homing direction observed\nin the real crab. The model home vector that most closely matched that of the\nreal crab was taken to comprise the path integration mechanism employed by\nfiddler crabs. The model that best matched the real crab gained direction and\ndistance idiothetically (from internal sources such as proprioceptors), and\nintegrated only voluntary locomotory information.Crabs were also made to run home across a patch of wet acetate, on which\nthey slipped and were thus forced to take more steps on the homeward path than\ntheoretically required by the home vector. Crabs whose running velocity across\nthe patch was unusually low also stopped short of their burrow before finding\nit. Crabs whose running velocity was not impeded by the patch did not stop\nshort, but ran straight to the burrow entrance, as did control crabs that ran\nhome with no slippery patch. We interpret this to mean that the velocity of\nsome crabs was impeded because of slipping, and these therefore stopped short\nof their burrow after having run out their homing vector. This is positive\nevidence in support of the hypothesis that path integration is mediated either\nby leg proprioceptors or by efferent commands, but our data do not allow us to\ndistinguish between these two possibilities."},{"title":"Heterotrophy on ultraplankton communities is an important source of nitrogen for a sponge–rhodophyte symbiosis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/24/4533","abstract":"Grazing on ultraplankton by the sponge partner of an invertebrate/algal\nsymbiotic association can provide enough particulate organic nitrogen to\nsupport the nitrogen needs of both partners.

On average, mice at\n30°C exported significantly less energy as milk (87.7 kJ\nday–1) than mice at 21°C (166.7 kJ\nday–1) and 8°C (288.0 kJ day–1). This\nreduction in milk energy output at 30°C was caused by a significant\ndecline in both milk flow (20.0 g day–1, 12.9 g\nday–1 and 8.5 g day–1 at 8°C, 21°C\nand 30°C, respectively) and gross energy content of milk (14.6 kJ\ng–1, 13.1 kJ g–1 and 10.5 kJ\ng–1 at 8°C, 21°C and 30°C, respectively). Milk\nproduced at 30°C contained significantly less total solids (34.4%) than\nmilk at 21°C (40.9%) and 8°C (41.5%) and significantly less fat\n(20.0%) than milk at 21°C (26.4%) and 8°C (30.3%). The reduced milk\nenergy output in mice exposed to 30°C, paralleled by their reduced food\nintake and low reproductive output, argues against the peripheral limitation\nhypothesis and provides strong support for the heat dissipation limit\nhypothesis."},{"title":"Introductory tail-flick of the Jacky dragon visual display: signal efficacy depends upon duration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/23/4293","abstract":"Many animal signals have introductory components that alert receivers.\nExamples from the acoustic and visual domains show that this effect is often\nachieved with high intensity, a simple structure and a short duration.\nQuantitative analyses of the Jacky dragon Amphibolurus muricatus\nvisual display reveal a different design: the introductory tail-flick has a\nlower velocity than subsequent components of the signal, but a longer\nduration. Here, using a series of video playback experiments with a digitally\nanimated tail, we identify the properties responsible for signal efficacy. We\nbegan by validating the use of the computer-generated tail, comparing the\nresponses to digital video footage of a lizard tail-flick with those to a\nprecisely matched 3-D animation (Experiment 1). We then examined the effects\nof variation in stimulus speed, acceleration, duration and period by expanding\nand compressing the time scale of the sequence (Experiment 2). The results\nidentified several variables that might mediate recognition. Two follow-up\nstudies assessed the importance of tail-flick amplitude (Experiment 3),\nmovement speed and signal duration (Experiment 4). Lizard responses to this\narray of stimuli reveal that duration is the most important characteristic of\nthe tail-flick, and that intermittent signalling has the same effect as\ncontinuous movement.

Here, we measure resting\nmetabolic rate (RMR; prior to breeding and at peak lactation) and\norgan morphology (at peak lactation) in MF1 mice exposed to 30°C\n(thermoneutrality) and compare these traits with the same parameters measured\npreviously in mice at 21°C and 8°C. The masses of visceral organs\nprimarily responsible for energy flux (heart, lungs, stomach, small intestine,\nlarge intestine, liver, pancreas, spleen and kidneys) increased as temperature\ndeclined. The masses of all these organs differed between mice exposed to\n8°C and 21°C, whereas only the masses of heart, liver and kidneys\ndiffered between mice at 21°C and 30°C. The increases in organ masses\nwere paralleled by increases in RMR at peak lactation above the\nlevels measured prior to breeding, with mice at 8°C and 21°C having\nsignificantly higher increases in RMR than mice at 30°C (29.6 kJ\nday–1, 25.5 kJ day–1 and 8.1 kJ\nday–1, respectively). The observed changes in visceral organs\nand RMR are consistent with both the heat dissipation and peripheral\nlimit hypotheses. However, mice exposed to 8°C had substantially larger\nmammary glands than mice at 21°C or 30°C (2.450 g, 1.115 g and 0.956 g\ndry mass, respectively), which argues against the peripheral limitation\nhypothesis and is consistent with the heat dissipation limit hypothesis.

This is believed\nto ensure the transparency of the tissue. The mechanism that triggers this\nprocess is unknown. We hypothesized that standing gradients of oxygen\ngenerated within the tissue may serve as a spatial cue for organelle\ndegradation. To examine this possibility, we incubated fertilized chicken eggs\nunder hyperoxic (50% O2) or normoxic (21% O2)\nconditions. Hyperoxic treatment was initiated on the seventh day of embryonic\ndevelopment (E7), five days before organelle degradation normally commences in\nthe lens core. Hyperoxia was maintained until E17. Under normoxic conditions,\nthe partial pressure of oxygen (PO) within the vitreous\ncompartment was low. Direct measurement of PO using an\noptode oxygen sensor indicated values of 1.3 kPa and 0.4 kPa for the mid- and\nanterior vitreous, respectively. Similarly, treatment with pimonidazole, a\nbio-reductive hypoxia marker, led to the formation of immuno-positive protein\nadducts within the lens, suggesting that the embryonic lens is chronically\nhypoxic in situ. Following hyperoxic treatment, vitreous\nPO significantly increased, although pimonidazole staining\nin the lens was not markedly affected. Confocal microscopy of slices prepared\nfrom hyperoxic lenses revealed a significant increase in the size of the lens\nrelative to age-matched normoxic controls. By E13, an organelle-free zone\n(OFZ) was present in the center of normoxic and hyperoxic lenses. However, in\nhyperoxic lenses, the OFZ was consistently smaller, and the distance from the\nlens surface to the border of the OFZ significantly larger, than in normoxic\ncontrols. These observations suggest that hyperoxia delays organelle breakdown\nand are consistent with a model in which hypoxia in the deep cortical layers\nof the normal lens serves as a trigger for the organelle loss process."},{"title":"Intrapopulational variation in the standard metabolic rate of insects:\nrepeatability, thermal dependence and sensitivity (Q10) of oxygen\nconsumption in a cricket","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/23/4309","abstract":"Studies focusing on physiological variation among individuals, and its\npossible evolutionary consequences, are scarce.

Consistent with these predictions, ankle\nextensors (gastrocnemius) and knee extensors (femorotibialis internus and\niliotibialis 2) exhibit increases in signal intensity during the use of more\nupright stance. Bone loading data also predicted that activation patterns for\nhip adductors spanning the length of the femur would not differ between\nsprawling and more upright posture.

However, the\nadductor puboischiofemoralis externus 3, which inserts far proximally on the\nfemur, displays significant increases in burst intensity that could contribute\nto the greater femoral adduction that is integral to upright posture.In contrast to patterns in alligators, in mammals EMG burst intensity\ntypically decreases during the use of upright posture. This difference in the\nmotor control of limb posture between these taxa may be related to differences\nin the relative sizes of their feet. Alligator feet are large relative to the\nhindlimb and, as a result, the ground reaction force shifts farther from the\nlimb joints during upright steps than in mammals, increasing flexor moments at\njoints and requiring alligator extensor muscles to exert greater forces to\nkeep the limb in equilibrium. However, several alligator hindlimb muscles show\nno differences in motor pattern between sprawling and upright posture. The\nwide range of motor pattern modulations between different postures in\nalligators suggests considerable independence of neural control among the\nmuscles of the alligator hindlimb."},{"title":"Energy budget of hepatocytes from Antarctic fish (Pachycara\nbrachycephalum and Lepidonotothen kempi) as a function of\nambient CO2: pH-dependent limitations of cellular protein\nbiosynthesis?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/22/3895","abstract":"Scenarios of rising CO2 concentration in surface waters due to\natmospheric accumulation of anthropogenic CO2, or in the deep sea\ndue to anticipated industrial dumping of CO2, suggest that\nhypercapnia (elevated partial pressure of CO2) will become a\ngeneral stress factor in aquatic environments, with largely unknown effects on\nspecies survival and well being, especially in cold and deep waters.

The\nhost-specific recognition cue in potato foliage for Manduca larvae is\nthe steroidal glycoside, indioside D. Two pairs of galeal taste sensilla, the\nlateral and medial sensilla styloconica, are both necessary and sufficient for\nthe feeding preferences of host-restricted larvae. We conducted\nelectrophysiological tip recordings from sensilla of solanaceous or wheat germ\ndiet-reared larvae. For each animal, recordings of the responses to indioside\nD, glucose, tomatine and KCl were compared. All responses included both phasic\nand tonic portions. The sensilla styloconica of solanaceous-reared larvae were\ntuned to indioside D, defined as maintaining a high sensitivity to indioside\nD, while showing lower sensitivity to other plant compounds. Half of the\nsensillar neurons of solanaceous-reared larvae were `tuned' to indioside D,\nwhereas those of wheat germ diet-reared larvae were not. The different\nresponses between the two types of animals were a result of changes of\nindividual receptor cells' responses in the sensilla. Feeding on solanaceous\nfoliage therefore appears to result in a modification of the physiological\nresponses of individual taste receptor cells that causes them to be tuned to\nthe host-recognition cue indioside D.

The present study\nmeasured changes in the levels of whole brain and extracellular amino acids,\nand extracellular dopamine, in the normoxic and 3-4 h anoxic frog Rana\npipiens, in order to determine whether their neurotransmitter responses\nresemble the anoxia-vulnerable or anoxia-tolerant response. Increases in whole\nbrain serine, glycine, alanine and GABA levels were similar to those seen in\nanoxia-tolerant species, although the levels of glutamine, taurine and\nglutamate did not increase as occurs in true facultative anaerobes.\nExtracellular levels of aspartate, taurine and GABA also increased\nsignificantly, while glutamate levels decreased. The maintenance of low\nextracellular glutamate was the most significant difference between the frog\nand the anoxic/ischemic mammalian brain, although aspartate did increase 215%\nover a 4 h period of anoxia. A 12-fold increase in extracellular dopamine\nlevels during anoxia was the biggest contrast between anoxia-tolerant\nvertebrates and R. pipiens.

Although basilisk lizards applied some\nof the same strategies to increase running velocity across water as other\ntetrapods do on land, their overall kinematics differ dramatically.

Finally, ankle and knee\nflexion in early stance is a defining feature of a tetrapod step during\nterrestrial locomotion; yet this characteristic is missing in aquatic basilisk\nrunning.

Contrary to our expectations, Ucrit2 was\nless than Ucrit1 for warm-acclimated fish\n(14.9±1.0°C), whereas Ucrit2 equaled\nUcrit1 for cold-acclimated fish (8.4±0.9°C).\nCold-acclimated fish also exhibited a lower Ucrit1 and\nless metabolic disruption compared with warm-acclimated fish. Thus, while warm\nacclimation conferred a faster Ucrit1, a similar swimming\nspeed could not be attained on subsequent swim after a 40 min recovery period.\nThis finding does not support the hypothesis that the ability of rainbow trout\nto reperform on Ucrit test is improved with temperature.\nBoth plasma lactate and plasma potassium levels were strongly correlated with\nUcrit1 performance. Therefore, the higher\nUcrit1 of warm-acclimated fish may have been due in part\nto a greater anaerobic swimming effort compared with cold-acclimated fish. In\nfact, a significant correlation existed between the plasma lactate\nconcentration prior to the start of the second test and the subsequent\nUcrit2 performance, such that Ucrit2\ndecreased when a threshold plasma lactate level of around 12.2 mmol\nl-1 was surpassed for the initial swim. No other measured plasma\nvariable showed a significant relationship with the Ucrit2\nperformance. We conclude that warm-acclimated fish, by apparently swimming\nharder and possibly more anaerobically compared with cold-acclimated fish,\nwere unable to recovery sufficiently well during the fixed recovery period to\nrepeat this initial level of performance, and this poorer repeat performance\nwas correlated with elevations in plasma lactate levels."},{"title":"Time-course of the effect of dietary l-tryptophan on plasma\ncortisol levels in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/20/3589","abstract":"Isolated juvenile rainbow trout were fed a feed supplemented with\nl-tryptophan (TRP) for 3, 7 or 28 days, after which they were\neither sampled directly (undisturbed) or subjected to a standardised stressor\nprior to sampling.

These results\nsuggest that (1) endogenous ammonia production was drastically reduced and (2)\nendogenous ammonia was detoxified effectively into urea. Indeed, there were\nsignificant decreases in glutamate, glutamine and lysine levels in the livers\nof fish exposed to air, which led to a decrease in the total free amino acid\ncontent. This indirectly confirms that the specimen had reduced its rates of\nproteolysis and/or amino acid catabolism to suppress endogenous ammonia\nproduction.

The present\nstudy aimed to elucidate whether the capacity of urea synthesis in H.\nsignifer could be upregulated in response to environmental ammonia\nexposure. When H. signifer was exposed to environmental ammonia,\nfairly high concentrations of ammonia were accumulated in the plasma and other\ntissues. This would subsequently reduce the net influx of exogenous ammonia by\nreducing the NH3 partial pressure gradient across the branchial and\nbody surfaces. There was also an increase in the OUC capacity in the liver.\nSince the ammonia produced endogenously could not be excreted effectively in\nthe presence of environmental ammonia, it was detoxified into urea through the\nOUC. In comparison, the South American freshwater stingray Potamotrygon\nmotoro, which has lost the capability to synthesize urea de\nnovo, was unable to detoxify ammonia to urea during ammonia loading. No\nincrease in glutamine was observed in the various tissues of H.\nsignifer exposed to environmental ammonia despite a significant increase\nin the hepatic glutamine synthetase activity. These results indicate that the\nexcess glutamine formed was channelled completely into urea formation through\ncarbamoyl phosphate synthetase III. It has been reported elsewhere that both\nurea synthesis and urea retention were upregulated in H. signifer\nexposed to 20‰ water for osmoregulatory purposes. By contrast, for\nH. signifer exposed to environmental ammonia in freshwater, the\nexcess urea formed was excreted to the external medium instead. This suggests\nthat the effectiveness of urea synthesis de novo as a strategy to\ndetoxify ammonia is determined not simply by an increase in the capacity of\nurea synthesis but, more importantly, by the ability of the animal to control\nthe direction (i.e. absorption or excretion) and rate of urea transport.

Seven cats\nwere trained to walk, trot and gallop at different speeds on a motor-driven\ntreadmill, and to walk up and down different slopes on a walkway.

DD induced TUNEL positivity and DNA laddering, but not\ncaspase-like activation, in copepod embryos spawned by females fed for 10-15\ndays the diatom diet Thalassiosira rotula Meunier (in vivo),\nor when newly spawned eggs were exposed for 1 h to 5 μg ml-1 DD\n(in vitro). To our knowledge, this is the first time that evidence\nfor an apoptotic process in copepods has been obtained by cytochemical (TUNEL)\nand biochemical (DNA fragmentation) approaches. The absence of caspase-like\nactivity in copepod embryos suggests that caspase-independent programmed cell\ndeath occurs in these organisms. In sea urchin embryos, DD induced apoptosis\nand also activated a caspase-3-like protease. The saturated aldehyde decanal\ninduced apoptosis at higher concentrations and after a longer incubation\nperiod than DD, indicating that α,β-unsaturation of the molecule,\ncoupled with the aldehyde group, is responsible for the greater biological\nactivity of DD. Since diatoms are an important food source for marine\nherbivores such as copepods and sea urchins, these findings may help explain\nwhy unsaturated aldehydes often induce reproductive failure, with important\necological consequences at the population level."},{"title":"Time course of the response of mitochondria from oxidative muscle during\nthermal acclimation of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/19/3455","abstract":"The time course of changes in the properties of mitochondria from oxidative\nmuscle of rainbow trout was examined during warm (15°C) and cold (5°C)\nacclimation.

This was most apparent for maximal rates of\nstate 3 oxygen consumption expressed per mg mitochondrial protein. Rates\nexpressed per nmol ADP-ATP translocase (ANT) showed this pattern during cold\nacclimation. A biphasic pattern was also apparent for state 4 and\noligomycin-inhibited (state 4ol) rates of oxygen uptake expressed\nper mg protein. Changes in states 4 and 4ol were smaller during\ncold than warm acclimation. Warm acclimation reduced the proportion of\ncytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase needed during mitochondrial\nsubstrate oxidation. Phospholipid concentrations per mg mitochondrial protein\nchanged little with thermal acclimation. Mitochondrial properties changed more\nquickly during warm than cold acclimation. While the biochemical modifications\nduring thermal acclimation may eventually compensate for the thermal change,\ncompensation did not occur at its onset.

In insects, female sperm storage affects fecundity, sperm\ncompetition/preference and receptivity to re-mating. Female sperm storage\nconsists of several stages, including sperm entry into the sperm storage\norgans (SSOs), maintenance within the SSOs and exit from the SSOs. The\nDrosophila melanogaster male seminal protein Acp36DE is essential for\nfemale sperm storage. Acp36DE associates with sperm and localizes to specific\nregions of the female reproductive tract, including the SSOs. We determined\nthe stage of sperm storage at which Acp36DE acts by comparing the timing of\ninitial sperm entry into storage as well as the rates of sperm accumulation\nand release from the SSOs in the presence or absence of Acp36DE. Acp36DE\naccelerates sperm accumulation into storage but does not mediate the entry of\nthe first sperm into storage. This finding also demonstrates that the initial\nstage of sperm storage consists of multiple steps. Acp36DE enters the SSOs\nbefore sperm, and its residence within the SSOs does not require sperm. We\npropose that once sperm storage has initiated, Acp36DE acts as a guidance\nfactor helping subsequent sperm move into storage, a corral concentrating\nsperm around the SSO entrances and/or a trigger for responses within the\nfemale that accelerate storage of sperm."},{"title":"Waterborne iron acquisition by a freshwater teleost fish, zebrafish\nDanio rerio","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/19/3529","abstract":"Waterborne iron accumulation by the gills of the zebrafish Danio\nrerio was assessed in ion-poor water. Branchial iron uptake, which\ncomprises both the iron that has entered the gill cells and iron that is\nstrongly bound to the epithelia, has high- and low-affinity components. At low\nnominal [Fe] (<40 nmol l-1) the high-affinity component\ndemonstrated saturation kinetics, with an apparent Km of\n5.9 nmol l-1 Fe and Vmax of 2.1 pmol\ng-1 h-1. Over a range of higher nominal [Fe] (40-200\nnmol l-1), branchial uptake was linear. In the presence of 2μ\nmol l-1 of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), branchial\niron accumulation was significantly enhanced at [Fe]>15 nmol\nl-1. The proton pump inhibitor bafilomycin A significantly reduced\niron uptake in the presence of DTT. On the basis of these observations we\nconclude that branchial iron uptake at low [Fe] shows characteristics similar\nto those of other iron-transporting epithelia, coupling an apical membrane\nferric reductase to a Fe2+/H+ symporter. Zebrafish\nbranchial iron transport at 18.6 nmol l-1 was inhibited by 200 nmol\nl-1 Cd2+. But, unlike other\nFe2+/H+ symporters, iron uptake was not affected by\nother divalent metals (Co2+, Ni2+, Pb2+,\nCu2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+).

We examined\nthe temporal changes in drift rates of 24 newly weaned southern elephant seal\n(Mirounga leonina) pups during their first trip to sea to determine\nif this easily recorded dive characteristic can be used to continuously\nmonitor changes in body composition of seals throughout their foraging trips.\nAll seals demonstrated a similar trend over time: drift rates were initially\npositive but decreased steadily over the first 30-50 days after departure\n(Phase 1), corresponding to seals becoming gradually less buoyant. Over the\nfollowing ∼100 days (Phase 2), drift rates again increased gradually,\nwhile during the last ∼20-45 days (Phase 3) drift rates either remained\nconstant or decreased slightly. The daily rate of change in drift rate was\nnegatively related to the daily rate of horizontal displacement (daily travel\nrate), and daily travel rates of more than ∼80 km were almost exclusively\nassociated with negative changes in drift rate.

During loaded flight,\nhummingbirds increased both wingbeat frequency and wing stroke amplitude by\n19% relative to free-flight values at any given elevation. We conclude that\nmodulation of wing stroke amplitude is a major compensatory mechanism for\nflight in hypodense or hypobaric environments.

Haversian remodeling is thought to be an adaptation to\nrepair microcracks or prevent microcrack propagation. Here, we examine whether\ncortical bone in sheep limbs modulates periosteal modeling and Haversian\nremodeling to optimize strength relative to mass in hind-limb midshafts in\nresponse to moderate levels of exercise at different growth stages.\nHistomorphometry was used to compare rates of periosteal growth and Haversian\nremodeling in exercised and sedentary treatment groups of juvenile, subadult\nand young adult sheep. In vivo strain data were also collected for\nthe tibia and metatarsal midshafts of juvenile sheep. The results suggest that\nlimb bones initially optimize responses to loading according to the varying\npower requirements associated with adding mass at different locations. In\njuveniles, exercise induces higher rates of periosteal modeling in proximal\nmidshafts and higher rates of Haversian remodeling in distal midshafts.\nConsequently, distal element midshafts experience higher strains and,\npresumably, have lower safety factors. As animals age, periosteal modeling\nrates decline and Haversian remodeling rates increase, but moderate levels of\nmechanical loading stimulate neither process significantly."},{"title":"The effect of colour vision status on the detection and selection of\nfruits by tamarins (Saguinus spp.)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/18/3159","abstract":"The evolution of trichromatic colour vision by the majority of anthropoid\nprimates has been linked to the efficient detection and selection of food,\nparticularly ripe fruits among leaves in dappled light.

Here, we test the idea\nthat hoopoe larks acclimated to 35°C would alter the lipid composition of\ntheir stratum corneum (SC), resulting in a decrease in CWL, but that skylarks,\nwoodlarks and Dunn's larks would not. Specifically, we hypothesized that\nhoopoe larks, acclimated to 35°C, would increase the proportions of polar\nceramide content and decrease the proportions of free fatty acids in their SC\ncompared with individuals acclimated to 15°C. Results showed that hoopoe\nlarks at 35°C had lower CWL and higher proportions of total ceramides but\nlower proportions of free fatty acids and sterols in their SC. We demonstrate\nthat adjustments in ratios of lipid classes in the SC are associated with\nchanges in CWL in hoopoe larks."},{"title":"Thermal acclimation of surfactant secretion and its regulation by\nadrenergic and cholinergic agonists in type II cells isolated from warm-active\nand torpid golden-mantled ground squirrels, Spermophilus\nlateralis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/17/3031","abstract":"Homeothermic mammals experience pulmonary surfactant dysfunction with\nrelatively small fluctuations in body temperature.

The recovery of C-starts, equilibrium and targeted\nfeeding was due to re-growth across the wound site, since re-crushing the\nspinal cord at the SML resulted in the loss of these behaviors. Mauthner cells\nare known to initiate C-starts in goldfish. Since the majority of M-axons that\nregrow across a crush wound associate with an inappropriate pathway (i.e. the\nfirst ventral root), it is unlikely that these cells play a major role in the\nreturn of C-starts.

In the last decade, large\namounts of thiotaurine, an unusual sulphur-amino acid, have been reported in\nsulphur-based symbioses from hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Compounds such\nas thiotaurine are known to take part in trans-sulphuration reactions, so the\ninvolvement of thiotaurine in sulphide metabolism has been suggested.

Moreover, the lack of any effect of\nsulphide in symbiont-free tissues and in gills of the methanotrophic mussel\nBathymodiolus childressi reinforces the assumption that thiotaurine\nsynthesis is a specific adaptation to the thiotrophic mode of life.

We explore this question by examining the in vivo\nforce-length performance of the guinea fowl Numida meleagris lateral\ngastrocnemius (LG) and digital flexor-IV (DF-IV), during level and incline\nlocomotion. During level locomotion, the LG and DF-IV exhibit differing muscle\nfascicle strain patterns: the LG shortens by 10-15% while developing force,\nwhereas the DF-IV undergoes a stretch-shorten cycle with large strain\namplitudes and small net strains of 1-8%. Furthermore, the DF-IV operates at\nhigher muscle stresses (92-130 kPa, compared to 23-39 kPa for LG) and\npossesses a longer tendon, which allows the DF-IV tendon to recover greater\nelastic energy than the LG tendon. During incline locomotion, these muscles\ncontribute only one-third of the energy expected for their mass, with the\nDF-IV exhibiting high stride-to-stride variability in work output.

After this\npoint, we gradually increased the temperature in the metabolism chamber until\nnormal Tb values and thermoneutral resting metabolism were\nrestored. We refer to this cycle as the down–up (DU) protocol. We\nestimated instantaneous oxygen consumption\n(V̇O2) using the\nequation of Bartholomew et al.\n(1981).\nV̇O2 and\nTb were monitored continuously during the trials.Here, we illustrate typical temperature and metabolism dynamics of the DU\nprotocol by describing several trials in detail, and we discuss the\nimplications of these results for the control of metabolism and regulation of\nTb. Chicks subjected to the DU protocol exhibited three\ndistinct phases of metabolic response to ambient temperature\n(Ta). In Phase I,\nV̇O2 increase was\ndirectly related to the gradient between Tb and\nTa, consistent with a Newtonian response to cooling.\nDuring Phase II, chicks sustained a maximum level of\nV̇O2 that\ndecreased as Tb dropped, exhibiting a\nQ10 of approximately 2. Based on the slope of the\nrelationship between\nV̇O2 and\nTb during Phase II, we were able to estimate maximum\nV̇O2 at a\nstandardized high Tb. Phase II continued until chick\nTb began to rise as a result of the gradually increasing\nTa. During Phase III, the Tb-adjusted\nrate of oxygen consumption decreased from the maximum level at low\nTb to the resting level at high Tb in\nthe thermoneutral zone. Further trials with faster and slower rates of chamber\ncooling showed that\nV̇O2 during Phase\nI varied in proportion to the difference between Tb and\nTa (ΔT), whereas during Phase III it\nresponded to Tb.Even though chicks may be capable of generating enough heat to regulate\nTb during the early part of Phase I of the DU protocol,\nthe constantly decreasing Ta created a time lag between\nTa and the chick's metabolic response, leading to body\ncooling. The hysteresis observed between Phase I and Phase III suggests that\nchicks rewarm passively while being brooded following the decrease in\nTb experienced during active foraging. The results of the\nDU protocol suggest that Tb should be measured\ncontinuously during measurements of maximum oxygen consumption, and that peak\nvalues should be adjusted by Tb to make them comparable\nwith other studies."},{"title":"Rapid mechano-sensory pathways code leg impact and elicit very rapid reflexes in insects","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/16/2715","abstract":"The temporal sequence of mechanoreceptor input arriving at the motoneuron\nlevel in the central nervous system (CNS) after distal mechanical contact was\nstudied for the locust middle leg.

Relative to published data on other shark species,\nmako RM appears to have a higher capillary density, a greater\ncapillary-to-fiber ratio and a higher myoglobin concentration. However, mako\nRM fiber size does not differ from that reported for other shark species and\nthe total volume of mitochondria in mako RM is similar to that reported for\nother sharks and for tunas.

We also hypothesized that the maximum fibre\nnumber (FNmax) would be negatively related to body size,\nand that both body size and size-corrected FNmax would\nshow phylogenetic signal (tendency for related species to resemble each\nother). Finally, we estimated ancestral values for body size and\nFNmax. A molecular phylogeny was constructed using 12S\nmitochondrial rRNA sequences. A total of 16 species were studied from the\nBeagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego (5-11°C), Shag Rocks, South Georgia\n(0.5-4°C), and Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula (-1.5 to 0.5°C).\nThe absence of muscle fibres of less than 10 μm diameter was used as the\ncriterion for the cessation of fibre recruitment. FDmax\nincreased linearly with standard length (SL), reaching 500-650 μm\nin most species. Maximum body size was a highly significant predictor of\nspecies variation in FNmax, and both body size and\nsize-corrected FNmax showed highly significant\nphylogenetic signal (P<0.001). Estimates of trait values at nodes\nof the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree were consistent with a progressive\nreduction in fibre number during part of the notothenioid radiation, perhaps\nserving to reduce basal energy requirements to compensate for the additional\nenergetic costs of antifreeze production. For example,\nFNmax in Chaenocephalus aceratus (12\n700±300, mean ± s.e.m.,\nN=18) was only 7.7% of the value found in Eleginops\nmaclovinus (164 000±4100, N=17), which reaches a similar\nmaximum length (85 cm).

The\nmuscle model consisted of a muscle-like actuator with frog hindlimb muscle\nproperties, operating across a lever to accelerate a load. We tested this\nmodel in configurations with and without a series elastic element and with and\nwithout a variable mechanical advantage. When total muscle shortening was held\nconstant at 30%, the model produced the most work when the muscle operated\nwith a series elastic element and an effective mechanical advantage that\nincreased throughout the contraction (31 J kg-1 muscle vs\n26.6 J kg-1 muscle for the non-compliant, constant mechanical\nadvantage configuration). We also compared the model output with the dynamics\nof jumping bullfrogs, measured by high-speed video analysis, and the length\nchanges of the plantaris muscle, measured by sonomicrometry. This comparison\nrevealed that the length, force and power trajectory of the body of jumping\nfrogs could be accurately replicated by a model of a fully active muscle\noperating against an inertial load, but only if the model muscle included a\nseries elastic element. Sonomicrometer measurements of the plantaris muscle\nrevealed an unusual, biphasic pattern of shortening, with high muscle\nvelocities early and late in the contraction, separated by a period of slow\ncontraction. The model muscle produced this pattern of shortening only when an\nelastic element was included.These results demonstrate that an elastic element can increase the work\noutput in a muscle-powered acceleration. Elastic elements uncouple muscle\nfiber shortening velocity from body movement to allow the muscle fibers to\noperate at slower shortening velocities and higher force outputs. A variable\nmuscle mechanical advantage improves the effectiveness of elastic energy\nstorage and recovery by providing an inertial catch mechanism. These results\ncan explain the high power outputs observed in jumping frogs.

By measuring the longitudinal static stability derivatives\nand mass distribution of desert locusts Schistocerca gregaria, we\nfind that their static stability and static control responses are insufficient\nto provide asymptotic longitudinal dynamic stability unless they are sensitive\nto pitch attitude (measured with respect to an inertial or earth-fixed frame)\nas well as aerodynamic incidence (measured relative to the direction of\nflight). We find no evidence for a `constant-lift reaction', previously\nsupposed to keep lift production constant over a range of body angles, and\nshow that such a reaction would be inconsequential because locusts can\npotentially correct for pitch disturbances within a single wingbeat. The\nstatic stability derivatives identify three natural longitudinal modes of\nmotion: one stable subsidence mode, one unstable divergence mode, and one\nstable oscillatory mode (which is present with or without pitch attitude\ncontrol). The latter is identified with the short period mode of aircraft, and\nshown to consist of rapid pitch oscillations with negligible changes in\nforward speed. The frequency of the short period mode (approx. 10 Hz) is only\nhalf the wingbeat frequency (approx. 22 Hz), so the mode would become coupled\nwith the flapping cycle without adequate damping. Pitch rate damping is shown\nto be highly effective for this purpose — especially at the small scales\nassociated with insect flight — and may be essential in stabilising\nlocust flight. Although having a short period mode frequency close to the\nwingbeat frequency risks coupling, it is essential for control inputs made at\nthe level of a single wingbeat to be effective.

Well-fed, wild-type worms distributed over a\nwide temperature range of up to 10°C, and, within this range, worms\nmigrated in both directions of the gradient at similar frequencies without any\nspecific response to the growth temperature in most cases.

Two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier analysis of\nTEMs of the collagen arrays revealed a ring of peak spatial frequencies in the\nspatial variation in refractive index that are the appropriate size to make\nthe observed ultraviolet–yellow colours by coherent scattering alone.\nOne species, Philepitta castanea (Eurylaimidae), has exceptionally\nordered, hexagonal arrays of collagen fibres that produce a hexagonal pattern\nof spatial frequency peaks in the power spectra. Ultraviolet, blue, green and\nyellow structural colours of avian skin are produced by coherent scattering\n(i.e. constructive interference) by arrays of collagen fibres in the dermis.\nSome yellow and orange skin colours are produced with a combination of\nstructural and pigmentary mechanisms. These combined colours can have\nreflectance spectra with discrete peaks that are more saturated than hues\nproduced by carotenoid pigments alone. Bluish facial skin from two species of\nNeotropical antbirds (Thamnophilidae) are nanostructurally too small to\nproduce visible light by coherent scattering, and the colour production\nmechanism in these species remains unknown. Based on the phylogenetic\ndistribution of structurally coloured skin in Aves, this mechanism of colour\nproduction has evolved convergently more than 50 independent times within\nextant birds."},{"title":"Food transport in the C. elegans pharynx","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/14/2441","abstract":"Pumping of the C. elegans pharynx transports food particles\n(bacteria) posteriorly.

Simulations in which particles are assumed to\nmove at mean fluid velocity when not captured by the walls of the pharyngeal\nlumen show that delayed isthmus motions do indeed cause net particle\ntransport; however, the amount is much less than in the real pharynx.

This study\ntests the hypothesis that precisely controlled mechanical loading can regulate\ngene expression, tissue differentiation and tissue architecture in the adult\nskeleton and that precise manipulation of the defect's local mechanical\nenvironment can initiate a limited recapitulation of joint tissue development.\nWe generated tissue type predictions using finite element models (FEMs)\ninterpreted by published mechanobiological fate maps of tissue\ndifferentiation. The experiment included a custom-designed external fixator\ncapable of introducing daily bending, shear or a combination of bending and\nshear load regimens to induce precisely controlled mechanical conditions\nwithin healing femoral defects. Tissue types and ratios were characterized\nusing histomorphometrics and molecular markers. Tissue molecular architecture\nwas quantified using polarized light and Fourier transforms, while\nimmunological staining and in situ hybridization were used to\ncharacterize gene expression. The finite element models predicted the\ndifferentiation of cartilage within the defects and that substantial fibrous\ntissues would develop along the extreme excursion peripheries in the bending\ngroup. The three experimentally induced loading regimens produced contiguous\ncartilage bands across all experimental defects, inhibiting bony healing.\nHistomorphometric analysis of the ratios of cartilage to bone in the\nexperimental groups were not significantly different from those for the knee\njoint, and Fourier transform analysis determined significantly different\ncollagen fibril angle specializations within superficial, intermediate and\ndeep layers of all experimental cartilages (P<0.0001),\napproximating those for articular cartilage. All stimulations resulted in the\nexpression of collagen type II, while the bending stimulation also resulted in\nthe expression of the joint-determining gene GDF-5.

This study\naimed to elucidate the strategies adopted by M. albus to defend\nagainst endogenous ammonia toxicity when kept out of water for 144 h (6 days).\nLike any other fish, M. albus has difficulties in excreting ammonia\nduring aerial exposure. In fact, the rates of ammonia and urea excretions\ndecreased significantly in specimens throughout the 144 h of aerial exposure.\nAt 144 h, the ammonia and urea excretion rates decreased to 20% and 25%,\nrespectively, of the corresponding control values. Consequently, ammonia\naccumulated to high levels in the tissues and plasma of the experimental\nspecimens. Apparently, M. albus has developed relatively higher\nammonia tolerance at the cellular and subcellular levels compared with many\nother teleost fish. Since the urea concentration in the tissues of specimens\nexposed to air remained low, urea synthesis was apparently not adopted as a\nstrategy to detoxify endogenous ammonia during 144 h of aerial exposure.\nInstead, ammonia produced through amino acid catabolism was detoxified to\nglutamine, leading to the accumulation of glutamine in the body during the\nfirst 72 h of aerial exposure. Complimenting the increased glutamine formation\nwas a significant increase in glutamine synthetase activity in the liver of\nspecimens exposed to air for 144 h. Formation of glutamine is energetically\nexpensive. It is probably because M. albus remained relatively\ninactive on land that the reduction in energy demand for locomotory activity\nfacilitated its exploitation of glutamine formation to detoxify endogenous\nammonia. There was a slight decrease in the glutamine level in the body of the\nexperimental animals between 72 h and 144 h of aerial exposure, which\nindicates that glutamine might not be the end product of nitrogen metabolism.\nIn addition, these results suggest that suppression of endogenous ammonia\nproduction, possibly through reductions in proteolysis and amino acid\ncatabolism, acts as the major strategy to avoid ammonia intoxication in\nspecimens exposed to air for ≥72 h. It is concluded that glutamine\nformation and reduction in ammonia production together served as effective\nstrategies to avoid the excessive accumulation of ammonia in the body of\nM. albus during 144 h of aerial exposure. However, these strategies\nmight not be adequate to sustain the survival of M. albus in the mud\nfor longer periods during drought because ammonia and glutamine concentrations\nhad already built up to high levels in the body of specimens exposed to air\nfor 144 h."},{"title":"Central circuitry in the jellyfish Aglantha digitale IV.\nPathways coordinating feeding behaviour","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/14/2487","abstract":"The hydromedusan jellyfish Aglantha digitale feeds on small\nplanktonic organisms carried to the margin by tentacle flexions.

Cutting\nexperiments showed that the conduction pathways concerned with pointing and\nlip flaring are located in eight radial strands consisting of a radial canal,\na giant nerve axon and a bundle of small axons with FMRFamide-like\nimmunoreactivity.Application of food juices to sites on the margin and tentacles evoked\ntrains of impulses in the axon bundles (F events; conduction velocity\n15.5±3.7 cm s-1) and in the epithelium lining the radial\ncanals (E events; conduction velocity 28.5±3.5 cm s-1).\nImpulses were conducted circularly in the outer nerve ring (F events) or in\nthe ring canal (E events).Unilateral flexions of the manubrium during pointing arise from\npreferential excitation of one or more of eight longitudinal `muscle bands' in\nthe wall of the manubrium and peduncle. Lip flaring represents symmetrical\ncontraction of all eight bands. Cutting experiments revealed that F events\nmediate pointing; E events mediate lip flaring. Thus the endodermal radial\ncanals, which in other hydromedusae mediate protective `crumpling', provide\nthe conduction pathway for manubrial lip flaring. Aglantha's\nalternative protective response – escape swimming – makes\ncrumpling unnecessary, releasing the pathway for use in feeding.Trains of E events, generated in the manubrium during ingestion, propagate\nto the margin and inhibit rhythmic (slow) swimming with a duration that\ndepended on their number and frequency. Inhibition of swimming appeared to\nfacilitate transfer of food from the margin to the mouth, but how it comes\nabout is unclear."},{"title":"Freezing and anoxia stresses induce expression of metallothionein in the\nfoot muscle and hepatopancreas of the marine gastropod Littorina\nlittorea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/14/2517","abstract":"Differential screening of cDNA libraries constructed from the foot muscle\nof marine snails Littorina littorea revealed several cDNAs that are\nupregulated during anoxia or freezing exposures, environmental stresses that\nare naturally endured by this species.

Amfor upregulation in the bee brain is\nassociated with the age-related transition from working in the hive to\nforaging for food outside, and cGMP treatment (which increases PKG activity)\ncauses precocious foraging. We present two lines of evidence in support of the\nhypothesis that Amfor affects division of labor by modulating\nphototaxis. We first show that a subset of worker bees involved in the removal\nof corpses from the hive had forager-like brain levels of Amfor brain\nexpression despite being middle aged; age-matched food-handlers, who do not\nleave the hive to perform their job, had low levels of Amfor\nexpression. This finding suggests that occupations that involve working\noutside the hive are associated with high levels of Amfor in brain.\nSecondly, foragers were much more positively phototactic than hive bees in a\nlaboratory assay, and cGMP treatment caused a precocious onset of positive\nphototaxis. The cGMP effect was not due to a general increase in behavioral\nactivity; cGMP treatment had no effect on locomotor activity under either\nconstant darkness or a light:dark regime. The cGMP effect also was not due to\nchanges in circadian rhythmicity; cGMP treatment had no effect on age at onset\nof locomotor circadian rhythmicity or the period of rhythmicity. The effects\nof Amfor on phototaxis are not related to peripheral processing;\nelectroretinogram analysis revealed no effect of cGMP treatment on\nphotoreceptor activity and no differences between untreated hive bees and\nforagers.

We exploited this phenomenon to evaluate the role of\nneurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5) in the regulation of muscle fiber phenotype.\nIntramuscular injections of recombinant NT-4/5 into the SOL muscle of rat\nneonates significantly accelerated the normal fast-to-slow MyHC isoform\ntransformation. Sequestration of endogenous NT-4/5 with TrkB–IgG\nprevented this transformation from occurring. Administration of the other TrkB\nligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), did not affect the normal\ncourse of the MyHC isoform transformation in this muscle, indicating that the\nobserved effect is NT-4/5 specific. Botulinum toxin blockade of synaptic\ntransmission significantly disrupted the normal fast-to-slow MyHC isoform\nswitch. Because administration of NT-4/5 to paralyzed muscles failed to\nrestore the normal course of this MyHC transformation, we believe that the\neffect of NT-4/5 is not directly on the muscle fibers but that it probably\nactivates or forms a type of retrograde signal to motoneurons. The\ndevelopmental upregulation of NT-4/5 mRNA in rat SOL muscle fibers occurred\nearlier than the upregulation of MyHC I/b mRNA associated with muscle\nfiber transformation. This timing is consistent with the idea that NT-4/5 is\ninvolved in early events that lead to the upregulation of the slow MyHC\nisoform in this muscle."},{"title":"Olfactory input increases visual sensitivity in zebrafish: a possible function for the terminal nerve and dopaminergic interplexiform cells","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/13/2201","abstract":"Centrifugal innervation of the neural retina has been documented in many\nspecies. In zebrafish Danio rerio, the only so-far described\ncentrifugal pathway originates from terminal nerve (TN) cell bodies that are\nlocated in the olfactory bulb. Most of the TN axons terminate in the forebrain\nand midbrain, but some project via the optic nerve to the neural\nretina, where they synapse onto dopaminergic interplexiform cells (DA-IPCs).\nWhile the anatomical pathway between the olfactory and visual organs has been\ndescribed, it is unknown if and how olfactory signals influence visual system\nfunctions. We demonstrate here that olfactory input is involved in the\nmodulation of visual sensitivity in zebrafish. As determined by a behavioral\nassay and by electroretinographic (ERG) recording, zebrafish visual\nsensitivity was increased upon presentation of amino acids as olfactory\nstimuli. This effect, however, was observed only in the early morning hours\nwhen zebrafish are least sensitive to light. The effect of olfactory input on\nvision was eliminated after lesion of the olfactory bulbs or after the\ndestruction of DA-IPCs. Intraocular injections of a dopamine D2 but\nnot a D1 receptor antagonist blocked the effect of olfactory input\non visual sensitivity. Although we cannot exclude the involvement of other\nanatomical pathways, our data suggest that the TN and DA-IPCs are the prime\ncandidates for olfactory modulation of visual sensitivity."},{"title":"Visual resolution of gratings by the compound eye of the bee Apis\nmellifera","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/13/2105","abstract":"Early measurements of the resolution of horizontal versus vertical\ngratings were confirmed, with a limit near a period of 2.5°, and the\nresolution is similar when vertical or horizontal gratings are tested\nseparately against grey.

A forager that experiences a short\nunloading delay will perform a waggle dance to recruit more nectar foragers. A\nlong unloading delay was until now the only known cause of tremble dancing.\nHowever, several studies suggested that factors at the food source may also\ncause tremble dancing. Here I test whether one of these factors, crowding of\nnectar foragers at the food source, stimulates tremble dancing because it\ncauses long unloading delays. To do so, I increased the density of nectar\nforagers at a food source by suddenly reducing the size of an artificial\nfeeder, and recorded the unloading delay experienced by each forager, as well\nas the dance she performed, if any. A forager's unloading delay was measured\nas the time interval between entering the hive and either (1) the first\nunloading contact with a nectar receiver bee, or (2) the start of the first\ndance, if dancing began before the first unloading contact. I also recorded\nthe unloading delays and dances of nectar foragers that returned from natural\nfood sources. The results show that crowding of nectar foragers at the food\nsource increases the probability of tremble dancing, but does not cause long\nunloading delays, and that tremble dancers that foraged at natural food\nsources also often have short unloading delays. When the cause of the tremble\ndance is not a low supply of nectar receiver bees, the tremble dance may have\na function in addition to the recruitment of nectar receiver bees."},{"title":"The V-type H+-ATPase in Malpighian tubules of Aedes\naegypti: localization and activity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/13/2211","abstract":"The V-type H+-ATPase is thought to provide the driving force for\ntransepithelial electrolyte and fluid secretion in Malpighian tubules.

The results show\nthat the development and shedding of vortices throughout each stroke are\nhighly stereotyped and influence force generation in subsequent strokes. When\na wing starts from rest, it generates a transient force as the leading edge\nvortex (LEV) grows. This early peak, previously attributed to added-mass\nacceleration, is not amenable to quasi-steady models but corresponds well to\ncalculations based on the time derivative of the first moment of vorticity\nwithin a sectional slice of fluid. Forces decay to a stable level as the LEV\nreaches a constant size and remains attached throughout most of the stroke.\nThe LEV grows as the wing supinates prior to stroke reversal, accompanied by\nan increase in total force. At stroke reversal, both the LEV and a rotational\nstarting vortex (RSV) are shed into the wake, forming a counter-rotating pair\nthat directs a jet of fluid towards the underside of the wing at the start of\nthe next stroke.

It appears that in\n15°C-acclimated fish, a lower apparent Na+/K+-ATPase\nactivity is compensated by strongly enhanced\nNa+/K+-ATPase expression (determined biochemically and\nimmunohistochemically). In 29°C-acclimated fish, the higher ambient\ntemperature activates the enzyme. Arrhenius plots for branchial\nNa+/K+-ATPase preparations of the three groups of fish\nsuggest the occurrence of different enzyme isoforms or protein (in)stability\nas explanations for differences in apparent enzyme activities, rather than\ntemperature-dependent changes in membrane fluidity. As for hormonal control\nover permeability, prolactin mRNA expression (and anticipated production and\nrelease) is lower in fish kept at 29°C, suggesting that control over\nbranchial permeability to water and ions needs to be downregulated at higher\ntemperatures.

The highest amounts of V-ATPase\nwere detected in total protein preparations from gill, heart and liver tissue.\nIn liver tissue, however, the western blot analysis indicated that vatB1 was\nnot as prominent as vatB2, and immunohistochemistry revealed that antibodies\ndirected against vatB1 yielded a very weak staining in a number of cells,\nwhile an antibody directed against vatB1 and vatB2 yielded a strong staining\nin virtually every cell. Similarly, neurosecretory cells of the small\nintestine were stained with an antibody directed against vatB1 and vatB2, but\nnot with an antibody specific for vatB1. Therefore we conclude that the\ndifferential expression of two isoforms of the V-ATPase subunits, which may\nserve different functions as in several mammalian species, may also be a\ncommon phenomenon in teleost fish."},{"title":"Localisation of VIP-binding sites exhibiting properties of VPAC receptors\nin chromaffin cells of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/11/1917","abstract":"The current model for the neuronal control of catecholamine release from\npiscine chromaffin cells advocates that the neurotransmitters vasoactive\nintestinal polypeptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating\npolypeptide (PACAP) are co-released with acetylcholine from preganglionic\nfibres upon nerve stimulation. Both VIP and PACAP elicit the secretion of\nexclusively adrenaline from rainbow trout chromaffin cells, which presumably\narises from the activation of VPAC type receptors. Thus, the goals of the\npresent study were (1) to localise VPAC receptors in the chromaffin cell\nfraction of the posterior cardinal vein (PCV) of trout and (2) to test the\nhypothesis that the selective secretion of adrenaline elicited by VIP could be\nexplained by the absence of the VPAC receptors from the\nnoradrenaline-containing cells.Fluorescent labelling of chromaffin cells using aldehyde-induced\nfluorescence of catecholamines and antisera raised against dopamineβ\n-hydroxylase (DβH) revealed a distinct layer of chromaffin cells\nlining the walls of the PCV. Furthermore, specific VIP-binding sites were\ndemonstrated on chromaffin cells using a biotinylated VIP that was previously\nestablished as being bioactive. Although multiple labelling experiments\nrevealed that a number of DβH-positive cells were immunonegative for\nphenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase (PNMT;\nnoradrenaline-containing cells versus adrenaline-containing cells,\nrespectively), labelling of VIP-binding sites was similar to that of DβH\nlabelling, suggesting that all chromaffin cells possess VIP-binding sites.\nPharmacological assessment of the VIP-binding sites indicated that they\nexhibited characteristics of VPAC receptors. Specifically, the labelling of\nVIP-binding sites was prevented after pre-treatment of PCV tissue sections\nwith unlabelled VIP, PACAP or the specific VPAC receptor antagonist VIP 6-28.\nBy contrast, sections pre-treated with the PAC1 receptor blocker\nPACAP 6-27 displayed normal labelling of VIP-binding sites. Finally, partial\ncDNA clones for the trout VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptor were\nobtained and sequenced. Tissue distribution experiments using RT-PCR revealed\nthe presence of VPAC1 receptor mRNA but not that of the\nVPAC2 receptor in the PCV tissue. The results provide direct\nevidence that VIP and PACAP can elicit the secretion of adrenaline from the\nchromaffin tissue via specific VIP-binding sites that exhibit\nproperties of VPAC receptors.

The cause of abrupt jumps\nin frequency has not been identified but can be explained on the basis of\nintrinsic properties of the vocal organ.

In both styles of brachiation, kinematic data suggest\nthat a gibbon overshoots the path that would allow a smooth transition into\nthe swing phase. The sudden change in velocity due to such an overshoot is\nassociated with a collision. Assuming neither the handhold nor the gibbon\nstores elastic strain energy, the energetic consequences of such overshoots\ncan be calculated.We suggest two reasons for overshooting smooth transition trajectories: in\nthe case of continuous contact brachiation, excess mechanical energy can be\nmaintained with a high amplitude swing, and an overshoot during ricochetal\nbrachiation produces a safety margin.The degree of energy loss with the transition to the swing phase is\ndependent both on the alignment of the pre- and post-transition paths, and on\nthe kinetic energy at that instant. Active mechanisms reduce the effects of\novershoots in both brachiation gaits.

Whirligig beetles (Coleoptera: Gyrinidae) are rigid-bodied, but\nthese aquatic insects can swim rapidly in circular patterns. Turning\nperformance of swimming whirligig beetles (Dineutes horni) was\nassessed by videotaping beetles in a small (115 mm diameter) arena at 500\nframes s–1 and 1000 frames s–1. Curved\ntrajectories were executed as continuous powered turns. Asymmetrical paddling\nof the outboard legs was used to power the turn. Turns were produced also by\nabduction of the inboard elytra and vectored thrust generated from sculling of\nthe wing at 47.14 Hz. The abducted elytra increased drag and acted as a pivot.\nSwimming speeds varied from 0.06 m s–1 to 0.55 m\ns–1 (4.7–44.5 L s–1).\nRelative minimum radius was 24%of body length. Maximum rate of turn was 4428\ndegrees s–1 with maximum centripetal acceleration of 2.86\ng. Turning radius was weakly associated with swimming velocity,\nalthough minimum values of the radius showed no correlation with velocity.\nTurning rate was also related indirectly to radius and directly to centripetal\nacceleration. Compared to vertebrates with flexible bodies, the relative\nturning radius of whirligig beetles is constrained by a rigid body and use of\ndrag-based propulsive mechanisms. However, these mechanisms permit continuous\nturning, and the size of the beetle permits higher turn rates with lower\ncentripetal accelerations."},{"title":"Polyamines as olfactory stimuli in the goldfish Carassius\nauratus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/10/1683","abstract":"Electrophysiological responses of goldfish olfactory receptor neurons\n(ORNs) and goldfish behavioral responses to polyamines were investigated\nin vivo.

Four markers\nplaced along the sagittal axis were digitized to allow observation of lateral\nbending and body rotation throughout the turn.

In\nthis phase of the stride cycle, the trunk was sagittally flexed and rotational\ninertia was 65% of that during maximal extension. By synchronizing body\nrotation with this portion of the stride cycle, mice can achieve a given\nangular acceleration with much lower applied torque.

A possible explanation for this difference lies\nin the more crouched limb posture of mice, which increases the mechanical\nadvantage for horizontal ground force production.

The mean number of teeth on the right file\nis 252; the teeth are more closely spaced in the posterior part of the file,\nwhich is engaged at the start of the song pulses. The anterior part of the\nfile is separated from the base of the harp by a short flexible region. The\ndorsal field of the wing, in which the harp is situated, is largely\nmechanically isolated from the driving veins of the lateral field, except for\na cross vein at the apex of the harp. The harps of the two wings did not\ndiffer significantly in area but the plectrum of the left wing was\nsignificantly longer and wider than that of the right wing. The posterior edge\nof the plectrum has a radius of approximately 0.5 μm, which allows it to\nengage the 20 μm-tall teeth of the file. The plectrum is separated from the\nwing by a 0.5 μm-thick crescent that allows it to twist lengthways and thus\ndisengage the file teeth. The sigmoid shape of the file allows the plectrum to\nengage teeth over most of the length of the file.The calling song of T. oceanicus consists of a chirp of four\nsimilar pulses followed by a trill of pairs of pulses. The dominant frequency\nof all pulses is approximately 4.8 kHz but cycle-by-cycle analysis suggests\nthat the different types of pulse are produced by wing-closing movements\nthrough different arcs. Free resonances of the left wing occurred at 4.56 kHz\n[quality factor (Q)=25.1] and of the right wing at 4.21 kHz\n(Q=23.9). Driven by loud sound, maximum vibration of the harp was\nseen at approximately 4.5 kHz; at lower sound levels, the vibration was\nconfined to the cross-veins of the harp that extend distally from the file.\nResonances of the left wing driven by vibration of the same wing, either at\nthe plectrum or on the anal area, occurred at similar frequencies to those of\nthe songs and had similar Qs but were approximately anti-phase,\ndemonstrating that movement of the plectrum (e.g. by the file teeth) causes an\nopposite movement of the harp. When the right wing was driven directly on the\nfile, the resonant frequency was 5.88 kHz but, when driven on the file\nvia a length of the left file and the left plectrum, it was 4.83 kHz.\nThe amplitude of the vibration increased from the posterior end of the file to\nthe middle then fell towards the anterior end of the file. Pushing a left\nplectrum across the middle of the right file produced trains of damped sound\npulses at 4.82 kHz (Q=23.4). Clicks excited from the anterior end of\nthe file had lower frequencies. The resonances excited from both the left wing\nvia its plectrum and from the right wing when driven via the\nleft plectrum were similar in frequency to that of the song.The resonance of the dorsal field persisted after ablation of the harp but\nthe mean resonant frequency increased 1.12-fold with a similar Q to\nthe intact wing. Droplets of water on the distal end of the harp or proximal\npart of the dorsal field raised the resonant frequency. The resonant frequency\nwas lowered by the addition of weights to the harp or the file; the factor of\nthe decrease suggested that the mass of the resonant system was approximately\n1.4 mg, which accords with the mass of the harp plus file plus anal area of\nthe wing (left wing, 1.27 mg; right wing, 1.15 mg) but is far heavier than the\nharp (0.22 mg).

The dung beetle Scarabaeus zambesianus\nstarts foraging at around sunset. After locating a source of fresh droppings,\nit forms a ball of dung and rolls it off at high speed to escape competition\nat and around the dung pile. Using behavioural experiments in the field and in\nthe laboratory, we show that the beetle is able to roll along a straight path\nby using the polarised light pattern of evening skylight. The receptors used\nto detect this skylight cue can be found in the ommatidia of the dorsal rim\narea of the eye, whose structures differ from the regular ommatidia in the\nrest of the eye. The dorsal rim ommatidia are characterised by rhabdoms with\nmicrovilli oriented at only two orthogonal orientations. Together with the\nfinding that the receptors do not twist along the length of the rhabdom, this\nindicates that the photoreceptors of the dorsal rim area are polarisation\nsensitive. Large rhabdoms, a reflecting tracheal sheath and a lack of\nscreening pigments make this area of the eye well adapted for polarised light\ndetection at low light levels. The fan-shaped arrangement of receptors over\nthe dorsal rim area was previously believed to be an adaptation to polarised\nlight analysis, but here we argue that it is simply a consequence of the way\nthat the eye is built."},{"title":"The energetics of the trot–gallop transition","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/9/1557","abstract":"Two studies have focused on potential triggers for the trot–gallop\ntransition in the horse. One study concluded that the transition was triggered\nby metabolic economy. The second study found that it was not metabolic factors\nbut, rather, peak musculoskeletal forces that determine gait transition\nspeeds. In theory, peak musculoskeletal forces should be the same when\ntrotting up an incline as when trotting at the same speed on the level.\nAssuming this is the case, we hypothesized that if peak forces determine gait\ntransition speeds then horses should switch from a trot to a gallop at the\nsame speed (i.e. the same critical force) regardless of incline. The aim of\nthe present research was to examine the effects of incline on the\ntrot–gallop transition speed in horses and to re-examine the role of\nmetabolism in determining the trot–gallop transition. Horses (Equus\ncaballus) were conditioned to run on a high-speed treadmill prior to data\ncollection. Gait changes were recorded for each horse using a standardized\ntesting protocol on the level and when trotting up a 10% incline. Both maximum\nsustained trotting speeds and minimum sustained galloping speeds, representing\nthe lower and upper limits of the trot–gallop transition, respectively,\nwere significantly slower when trotting up an incline. After completing\ncollection of gait transition data, the horses were trained to extend their\ngaits beyond the normal transition speeds, and metabolic data were collected.\nMaximum sustained trotting speeds were not different from the energetically\noptimal transition speeds, i.e. the speed at which metabolic rates are the\nsame for both gaits."},{"title":"Adaptation in pheromone-sensitive trichoid sensilla of the hawkmoth\nManduca sexta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/9/1575","abstract":"In extracellular tip recordings from long trichoid sensilla of male\nManduca sexta moths, we studied dose–response relationships in\nresponse to bombykal stimuli of two different durations in the adapted and the\nnon-adapted state. Bombykal-responsive cells could be distinguished from\nnon-bombykal-sensitive cells in each trichoid sensillum because the\nbombykal-responsive cell always generated the action potentials of larger\ninitial amplitude. The bombykal cell, which was recorded at a defined location\nwithin a distal flagellar annulus, can resolve at least four\nlog10-units of pheromone concentrations but is apparently unable to\nencode all stimulus durations tested. Parameters of the amplitude-modulated\nsensillar potential and the frequency-modulated action potential responses\nwere examined in different states of adaptation. Evidence is presented for the\nexistence of several mechanisms of adaptation, which affect distinct steps of\nthe transduction cascade. After adapting pheromone stimuli, the sensillar\npotential rises to a lower amplitude and declines faster compared with the\nnon-adapted response. In addition, the frequency of the adapted action\npotential response is reduced. Only the time of rise of the sensillar\npotential is differentially affected by adapting pheromone stimuli of\ndifferent duration. The time of rise does not increase after short, but only\nafter long, adapting stimuli. Both short and long adapting stimuli shift the\ndose–response curves of the sensillar potential amplitude, as well as\nthe initial slope of its rising phase, to higher stimulus concentrations by\napproximately one log10-unit. The shift in the dose–response\ncurve of the action potential response is larger than for the sensillar\npotential response, suggesting that an additional adaptation mechanism acts at\nthe level of action potential generation. Furthermore, a faster decline of the\nsensillar potential after short and long adapting stimuli suggests that the\nresting potential of the olfactory receptor neuron is stabilized."},{"title":"Functional consequences of a gene duplication and fusion event in an arginine kinase","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/9/1545","abstract":"Arginine kinase (AK) from the foot of the razor clam Ensis\ndirectus consists of two full-length AK domains, denoted D1 and D2, fused\nin a single polypeptide chain.

The catalytic properties of the active proteins\nwere compared with the corresponding properties of recombinant AK from the\nhorseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus, which is a typical monomeric AK.\nIn contrast to expectations, the kinetic results strongly suggest that\nEnsis AK has only one active domain, namely D2.

The D2–NusA–His-tag fusion construct actually displayed\nnegative synergism of substrate binding, which means that, in effect, the\nfirst substrate bound acts as a competitive inhibitor of the second.

Second, do small, semi-erect mammals employ the energy-saving\npendular and spring-based mechanics used by erect mammals? Third, how well do\nmechanical locomotor patterns of the center of mass correlate with gaits?\nMonodelphis domestica utilizes only fast walking and running trot\ngaits over a fivefold increase in speed, over which we could illicit constant\nvelocity steps, although running trots were their preferred gait. In sustained\nlevel locomotion the opossums did not use other walking gaits presumed to be\nprimitive for tetrapods. Across the full range of speeds their trotting gaits\nexhibited force patterns and in-phase mechanical energy fluctuations that are\ncharacteristic of spring-mass mechanics.

Furthermore, the onset of an aerial phase was not clearly associated\nwith either the walk/run gait transition (50% duty factor) or a change in\ncenter-of-mass mechanics.

To test the\nhypothesis that isotope turnover is higher in nectar-feeding bats, because of\ntheir high mass-specific metabolic rates, than in other eutherian mammals, we\nconducted diet-switching experiments and chose three target tissues (hair,\nwing membrane and blood) to evaluate the isotopic turnover rates. We made the\nfollowing predictions: (1) isotopic composition should change towards higherδ\n13C-values due to the turnover of carbon isotopes of\nC3 origin with those of C4/CAM origin; (2) the turnover\nrates of carbon isotopes would differ between the three types of tissues in\nthe following order of decreasing turnover rates: blood>wing\nmembrane>hair; and (3) turnover rates of nectar-feeding bats should exceed\nthose reported for other small mammals because of the high mass-specific\nmetabolic rate of nectar-feeding bats.

The low turnover rate in wing\nmembrane may reflect its specific composition and the relatively low\ntemperature of this tissue, and long-lived erythrocytes in bat blood may be\nresponsible for the low turnover rate of carbon isotopes in blood. The\nturnover rate of stable carbon isotopes in hair was low in L.\ncurasoae and undetectable in G. soricina, which may be explained\nby the seasonal growth of the hair in these two species.

Growth was investigated using a mixed-effect statistical\nmodel with repeated measures, which included terms for treatment effect and\nrandom fish effects for individual growth rate (α) and the instantaneous\ngrowth rate per unit change in temperature (γ). Prior to seawater\ntransfer, fish were heavier in the heated (61.6±1.0 g; N=298)\nthan in the ambient (34.1±0.4 g; N=206) treatments, reflecting\ntheir greater growth opportunity: 4872 degree-days and 4281 degree-days,\nrespectively. However, the subsequent growth rate of the heated group was\nlower, such that treatments had a similar body mass (3.7-3.9 kg) after\napproximately 450 days in seawater. The total cross-sectional area of fast\nmuscle and the number (FN) and size distribution of the fibres was\ndetermined in a subset of the fish. We tested the hypothesis that freshwater\ntemperature regime affected the rate of recruitment and hypertrophy of muscle\nfibres. There were differences in FN between treatments and a\nsignificant age×treatment interaction but no significant cage effect\n(ANOVA). Cessation of fibre recruitment was identified by the absence of\nfibres of <10 μm diameter. The maximum fibre number was 22.4% more in\nthe ambient (9.3×105±2.0×104 than in\nthe heated (7.6×105±1.5×104)\ntreatments (N=44 and 40 fish, respectively; P<0.001). For\nfish that had completed fibre recruitment, there was a significant correlation\nbetween FN and individual growth rate, explaining 35% of the total\nvariation. The density of myogenic progenitor cells was quantified using an\nantibody to c-met and was approximately 2-fold higher in the ambient than in\nthe heated group, equivalent to 2-3% of the total muscle nuclei. The number of\nmyonuclei in isolated fibre segments showed a linear relationship with fibre\ndiameter. On average, there were 20.6% more myonuclei in 200-μm-diameter\nfibres isolated from the ambient (3734 myonuclei cm-1) than from\nthe heated (3097 myonuclei cm-1) treatments. The maximum fibre\ndiameter was greater in heated than in ambient groups, whereas the\nage×treatment interaction was not significantly different (ANCOVA).\nThere were also no consistent differences in the rate of hypertrophy of muscle\nfibres between treatments. It was concluded that freshwater temperature regime\naffected fibre number and the nuclear content of fast muscle in seawater but\nnot the rate of fibre hypertrophy.

The appearance of MF in the exuvial space is accompanied by a\ndramatic reduction in the amplitude of the foregut contractions. Foregut\nperistalsis returned about halfway through the molt, followed shortly by the\nappearance of MF in the gut. These observations suggested that larvae use\ntheir foreguts to remove MF from the exuvial space. Animals whose foreguts\nwere surgically inactivated did not resorb their MF and most failed to\nsuccessfully shed their old cuticles. The reduction in foregut motility at the\nonset of the molt was correlated with a sharp decline in the amplitude of the\nexcitatory junctional potentials. With the onset of the molt there was also a\ndecline in the number of presynaptic terminals on the foregut that loaded with\nthe activity-dependent dye FM1-43. In the second half of the molt, the\nappearance of MF in the foregut and the return of foregut motility was\ncorrelated with an increase in FM1-43 loading.

In zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), song consists of\nrepetitions of a stereotyped sequence of distinct syllables (motif). Syllables\ncorrespond to distinct expiratory pulses, which alternate with short deep\ninspirations. We investigated the effect of the song motor pattern on\nrespiration using a newly developed mask system to measure oxygen consumption\nwhile simultaneously monitoring subsyringeal air sac pressure. The metabolic\ncost of song is closely related to song duration (mean=85.7 μl\nO2 g-1 min-1 over pre-song levels) and\nconfirms earlier estimates for this species. When motif duration is controlled\nfor, there is only small interindividual variability in oxygen consumption per\nmotif. The oxygen measurements were also used to evaluate various methods of\nestimating and reporting the metabolic cost. Up to 20s before song,\nrespiratory activity and oxygen consumption increased. Shortly before and\nduring the introductory notes of the song bout, respiration and oxygen\nconsumption decreased markedly. In some individuals, significant\nhyperventilation occurred during song, causing almost complete apnea after the\nsong. In three different birds, we measured tracheal airflow and air sac\npressure during song. Birds with higher airflow during song relative to flow\nduring quiet respiration had a more pronounced decrease in respiratory\nactivity after the song bout. These results suggest that gas exchange\ncontinues in the lung during the song bout and that long expiratory pressure\npulses of the song motif can lead to hyperventilation but that no oxygen debt\nresulted from song. This research allows a first assessment of respiratory\nconstraints that may influence the evolution of song complexity."},{"title":"Putative involvement of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone isoforms in the\nneuroendocrine mediation of osmoregulation in the crayfish Astacus\nleptodactylus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/6/979","abstract":"This study investigates the involvement of eyestalk neuroendocrine factors\non osmoregulation in the crayfish Astacus leptodactylus maintained in\nfreshwater.

During this gait,\nbody amplitudes and curvatures are much larger than those of trout swimming at\nan equivalent flow velocity in the absence of a cylinder. Tail-beat frequency\nis not only lower than might be expected for a trout swimming in the reduced\nflow behind a cylinder, but also matches the vortex shedding frequency of the\ncylinder. Therefore, in addition to choosing to be in the slower flow velocity\noffered behind a cylinder (drafting), trout are also altering their body\nkinematics to synchronize with the shed vortices (tuning), using a mechanism\nthat may not involve propulsive locomotion. This behavior is most distinctive\nwhen cylinder diameter is large relative to fish length.

During constant-speed swimming (0.5 and\n1.0 body length s-1), the pectoral fins remain adducted against the\nbody. These fins are actively recruited, however, for a variety of maneuvering\nbehaviors, including station holding in still water (hovering), low-speed\n(i.e. non-fast-start) turning, and rapid deceleration of the body during\nbraking. Despite having a shallow pectoral-fin base orientation (the\nplesiomorphic teleost condition), trout are capable of rotating the fin base\nover 30° during maneuvering, which affords the fin an impressive degree of\nkinematic versatility. When hovering, the pectoral fins are depressed beneath\nthe body and twisted along their long axes to allow anteroposterior sculling.\nDuring turning and braking, the fins undergo spanwise rotation in the opposite\ndirection and exhibit mediolateral and dorsoventral excursions. Water velocity\nfields and calculated momentum flows in the wake of the pectoral fins reveal\nthat positive thrust is not generated during maneuvering, except during the\nretraction half-stroke of hovering. Relatively large laterally directed fluid\nforce (mean 2.7 mN) is developed during turning, whose reaction powers yawing\nrotation of the body (4-41° s-1). During deceleration, the\nwake-force line of action falls below the center of mass of the body, and this\nresult supports a long-standing mechanical model of braking by fishes with\nventrally positioned paired fins. Despite its traditional categorization as a\npropulsor of limited functional importance, the salmoniform pectoral fin\nexhibits a diverse locomotor repertoire comparable to that of higher\nteleostean fishes."},{"title":"Involvement of Gq/11 in signal transduction in the mammalian\nvomeronasal organ","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/5/827","abstract":"Social behaviors of most mammals are profoundly affected by pheromones.\nPheromones are detected by G-protein coupled receptors in the vomeronasal\norgan (VNO).

The rank order of effectiveness as muscle relaxants when tested at a\nconcentration of 10 μmol l-1 was SNAP>S2>S1 for both tube\nfeet and apical muscle whereas for cardiac stomach it was S2>S1>SNAP.\nSignificantly, these data indicate that NO and SALMFamide neuropeptides\nfunction as general muscle relaxants in starfish but vary in their relative\nimportance in different organ systems.The molecular mechanisms by which NO and SALMFamides cause muscle\nrelaxation in starfish are not known, but previous pharmacological studies on\nthe cardiac stomach using the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor\n1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazol[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) indicate that the cyclic\nnucleotide second messenger cGMP may mediate effects of NO.

To\nfurther investigate the involvement of cyclic nucleotides as mediators of the\neffects of NO and SALMFamides on starfish muscle, we have measured both cGMP\nand cAMP in cardiac stomach and in apical muscle after treatment with S1, S2\nor SNAP. However, no significant changes in cyclic nucleotide content were\nobserved compared with controls.

Ants from three nests were trained along L-shaped\nroutes to a feeder. Each route was entirely within open-topped channels that\nobscured all natural landmarks. Conspicuous artificial landmarks were attached\nto the channelling that formed the latter part of the route. The homeward\nvectors of ants accustomed to the route were tested with the foodward route,\neither as in training, or with the first leg of the L shortened or extended.\nThese ants were taken from the feeder to a test area and released, whereupon\nthey performed a home vector. If travelling the latter part of a familiar\nroute and arriving at a familiar food site triggers the recall of an\naccustomed home vector, then the home vector should be the same under both\ntest conditions. We find instead that the home vector tended to reflect the\nimmediately preceding outward journey. In conjunction with earlier work, these\nexperiments led us to conclude in the case of desert ants that landmark\nmemories do not prime the recall of long-term global path integration\nmemories. On the other hand, landmark memories are known to be linked to local\npath integration vectors that guide ants along a segment of a route.

We used high-speed video endoscopy to\ndetermine whether carp Cyprinus carpio use crossflow filtration\nand/or palatal protrusions during benthic feeding.

The\nmajor sites of ROS formation are found at NADH dehydrogenase of complex I and\nat the interface between coenzyme Q and complex III. Inhibitors of complex III\nshould thus upregulate ROS from both sites; inhibitors of complex I should\nupregulate ROS from the first but not the second site, while uncouplers of\noxidative phosphorylation should downregulate ROS from both sites. To\ninvestigate the possibility of such redox signaling, perturbations of colony\ngrowth and development were carried out using the hydroid Podocoryna\ncarnea. Oxygen uptake of colonies was measured to determine comparable\nphysiological doses of antimycin A1 (an inhibitor of complex III),\nrotenone (an inhibitor of complex I) and carbonyl cyanide\nm-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation).\nUsing these doses, clear effects on colony growth and development were\nobtained. Treatment with antimycin A1 results in `runner-like'\ncolony growth, with widely spaced polyps and stolon branches, while treatment\nwith CCCP results in `sheet-like' growth, with closely spaced polyps and\nstolon branches. Parallel results have been obtained previously with azide, an\ninhibitor of complex IV, and dinitrophenol, another uncoupler of oxidative\nphosphorylation. Perhaps surprisingly, rotenone produced effects on colony\ndevelopment similar to those of CCCP. Assays of peroxides using\n2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and fluorescent microscopy\nsuggest a moderate difference in ROS formation between the antimycin and\nrotenone treatments. The second site of ROS formation (the interface between\ncoenzyme Q and complex III) may thus predominate in the signaling that\nregulates colony development. The fat-rich, brine shrimp diet of these\nhydroids may be relevant in this context. Acyl CoA dehydrogenase, which\ncatalyzes the first step in the mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids,\ncarries electrons to coenzyme Q, thus bypassing complex I.

We have studied the\nrole played by the bony carapace of the smooth trunkfish in generating\ntrimming forces that self-correct for instabilities. The flow patterns, forces\nand moments on and around anatomically exact, smooth trunkfish models\npositioned at both pitching and yawing angles of attack were investigated\nusing three methods: digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV), pressure\ndistribution measurements, and force balance measurements. Models positioned\nat various pitching angles of attack within a flow tunnel produced\nwell-developed counter-rotating vortices along the ventro-lateral keels. The\nvortices developed first at the anterior edges of the ventro-lateral keels,\ngrew posteriorly along the carapace, and reached maximum circulation at the\nposterior edge of the carapace. The vortical flow increased in strength as\npitching angles of attack deviated from 0°, and was located above the\nkeels at positive angles of attack and below them at negative angles of\nattack. Variation of yawing angles of attack resulted in prominent dorsal and\nventral vortices developing at far-field locations of the carapace; far-field\nvortices intensified posteriorly and as angles of attack deviated from 0°.\nPressure distribution results were consistent with the DPIV findings, with\nareas of low pressure correlating well with regions of attached, concentrated\nvorticity. Lift coefficients of boxfish models were similar to lift\ncoefficients of delta wings, devices that also generate lift through vortex\ngeneration. Furthermore, nose-down and nose-up pitching moments about the\ncenter of mass were detected at positive and negative pitching angles of\nattack, respectively. The three complementary experimental approaches all\nindicate that the carapace of the smooth trunkfish effectively generates\nself-correcting forces for pitching and yawing motions — a\ncharacteristic that is advantageous for the highly variable velocity fields\nexperienced by trunkfish in their complex aquatic environment. All important\nmorphological features of the carapace contribute to producing the\nhydrodynamic stability of swimming trajectories in this species."},{"title":"Novel natural ligands for Drosophila olfactory receptor\nneurones","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/4/715","abstract":"Due to its well-defined genome, the fruitfly Drosophila\nmelanogaster has become a very important model organism in olfactory\nresearch.

In its natural habitat, it may encounter bouts\nof aerial exposure during the dry seasons. In the laboratory, the ammonia\nexcretion rate of C. asiatica exposed to terrestrial conditions in a\n12h:12h dark:light regime was one quarter that of the submerged control.\nConsequently, the ammonia contents in the muscle, liver and plasma increased\nsignificantly, and C. asiatica was able to tolerate quite high levels\nof ammonia in its tissues. Urea was not the major product of ammonia\ndetoxification in C. asiatica, which apparently did not possess a\nfunctioning ornithine urea cycle. Rather, alanine increased fourfold to 12.6μ\nmolg-1 in the muscle after 48h of aerial exposure. This is the\nhighest level known in adult teleosts exposed to air or an ammonia-loading\nsituation. The accumulated alanine could account for 70% of the deficit in\nammonia excretion during this period, indicating that partial amino acid\ncatabolism had occurred. This would allow the utilization of certain amino\nacids as energy sources and, at the same time, maintain the new steady state\nlevels of ammonia in various tissues, preventing them from rising further.\nThere was a reduction in the aminating activity of glutamate dehydrogenase\nfrom the muscle and liver of specimens exposed to terrestrial conditions. Such\na phenomenon has not been reported before and could, presumably, facilitate\nthe entry of α-ketoglutarate into the Krebs cycle instead of its\namination to glutamate, as has been suggested elsewhere. However, in contrast\nto mudskippers, C. asiatica was apparently unable to reduce the rates\nof proteolysis and amino acid catabolism, because the reduction in nitrogenous\nexcretion during 48 h of aerial exposure was completely balanced by\nnitrogenous accumulation in the body. Alanine accumulation also occurred in\nspecimens exposed to terrestrial conditions in total darkness, with no change\nin the total free amino acid content in the muscle. Exercise on land led to a\ndecrease in glycogen content, and an increase in lactate levels, with no\nsignificant effect on ammonia and alanine contents in the muscle of C.\nasiatica. Hence, unlike the mudskipper Periophthalmodon schlosseri,\nC. asiatica was incapable of increasing the rate of partial amino acid\ncatabolism to sustain locomotory activities on land. Alanine formation\ntherefore appears to be a common strategy adopted by obligatory air-breathing\nfishes to avoid ammonia toxicity (not a strategy to detoxify ammonia) on land,\nbut not all of them can utilize it to fuel muscular activities."},{"title":"Measuring wing kinematics, flight trajectory and body attitude during forward flight and turning maneuvers in dragonflies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/4/745","abstract":"A robust technique for determining the wing kinematics, body position and\nattitude of a free-flight dragonfly is described.

At the femoro—tibial\njoints, the semi-lunar processes are bent, the cuticle of the dorsal distal\nfemur is crumpled, and the femur is expanded in a mediolateral direction. We\nhave analysed whether these distortions are monitored by sense organs and\nwhether the information they provide is used to limit the forces generated and\nthus prevent structural damage to the joint.The two sensory neurons comprising the lump receptor lie in a groove in the\nventral part of the distal femur. The sensory neurons spike if force is\napplied to the flexor tendon when the joint is fully flexed, but not when it\nis extended. They also spike as the tendon of the flexor muscle slides into\nthe ventral femoral groove when the tibia is fully flexed during the\nco-contraction phase of kicking. Their spike frequency correlates with the\nextent of bending of a semi-lunar process that provides a quantifiable measure\nof the joint distortions. If the tibia is not fully flexed, however, then\nmuscle contractions still cause distortions of the joint but these are not\nsignalled by sensory spikes from the lump receptor. The lump receptor,\ntherefore, does not respond primarily to the joint distortions but to the\nmovements or force in the flexor tendon.Contractions of the flexor tibiae muscle caused by spikes in individual\nflexor motor neurons can evoke spikes in sensory neurons from the lump\nreceptor when the joint is fully flexed. In turn, the sensory neurons cause a\nhyperpolarisation in particular flexor motor neurons in a polysynaptic\nnegative feedback loop. The lump receptor could, therefore, regulate the\noutput of the flexor motor neurons and, thus, limit the amount of force\ngenerated during co-contraction. It may also contribute to the inhibition of\nthe flexors at the end of co-contraction that allows rapid kicking movements\nto occur."},{"title":"Mechanics of cuticular elastic energy storage in leg joints lacking extensor muscles in arachnids","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/4/771","abstract":"Certain leg joints in arachnids lack extensor muscles and have elastically\ndeformable transarticular sclerites spanning their arthrodial membranes, an\narrangement consistent with a model in which flexor muscles load\ntransarticular sclerites during flexion and energy from elastic recoil is used\nfor extension.

Extension torques of isolated joints with and without\ntransarticular sclerites were measured as the joint was rotated through angles\nand at angular velocities comparable with those used by walking animals. The\nprocedure was repeated with the joint subjected to different internal fluid\npressures in order to assess the potential role of hydraulically induced\nextension.The efficiency of elastic energy storage (resilience) in the absence of\ninternal fluid pressure was 70-90% for joints with well-developed\ntransarticular sclerites, and the magnitude of torque was similar to those\nproduced by different joint extension mechanisms in other arthropods.\nIncreased internal fluid pressure acted synergistically with transarticular\nsclerites in some joints but had little or no effect in others. Joints that\nlacked both extensor muscles and transarticular sclerites appeared to be\nspecialized for hydraulic extension, and joints operated by antagonistic\nmuscles lacked apparent specializations for either elastic or hydraulic\nextension. It is well known that elastic energy storage is a significant\ncontributor to propulsion in running vertebrates and certain arthropods, where\nelastic elements are loaded as the center of mass falls during one phase of\nthe locomotor cycle. However, transarticular sclerites are apparently loaded\nby contraction of flexor muscles when the leg is not in contact with the\nsubstratum. Hence the mechanism of a transarticular sclerite is more similar\nto the flight and jumping mechanisms of other arthropods than to running\nvertebrates.

Our results\nfor turtles reared on paper revealed that seasonal development of supercooling\ncapacity fundamentally requires elimination of ice-nucleating agents (INA) of\nendogenous origin: summer turtles, but not winter turtles, produced feces\n(perhaps derived from residual yolk) that expressed ice-nucleating activity.\nIngestion of vermiculite or eggshell, which had modest ice-nucleating\nactivity, had no effect on the Tc, whereas ingestion of\nnesting soil, which contained two classes of potent INA, markedly reduced the\nsupercooling capacity of summer turtles.

There is a\nnearly instantaneous change in Hct that occurs during the hemorrhage period;\nit is dependent on hemorrhage duration and volume and not associated with the\nsubsequent mono-exponential recovery. This initial response is best explained\nby a rapid fluid shift from a large-volume (approximately 40% of total blood\nvolume), low-hematocrit (less than half of systemic Hct) microcirculation into\nthe higher-hematocrit macrocirculation. These studies are consistent with\ntranscapillary fluid flux across a barrier that is highly permeable to\nprotein, and cannot be explained by fluid shift between primary and secondary\ncirculations, or by transcapilllary flux across a capillary bed that is\nimpermeable to plasma proteins. The results support the hypothesis that\nwhole-body reflection coefficients in trout are very low and that plasma\noncotic pressure is not a determinant of transcapillary fluid balance.

Ants learn a stable route with the first\nsegment of their trajectory aimed at the cylinder, which becomes an\nintermediate goal on the way to the feeder. When in occasional tests the\ncylinder is removed or displaced, ants head for the usual site of the\ncylinder.

Ants thus reinforce\ntheir ability to reach the cylinder by learning other visual features in their\nsurroundings that can also steer them to its location. The use of beacon\naiming in fixing routes has several benefits.

The effects of\ncandidate neurohormones on cardioarterial valves were examined by measuring\nthe pressure in each artery at which haemolymph flows out of the heart through\nthe valve. Serotonin, octopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate (Glu) and\nproctolin constricted the cardioarterial valves and thus decreased the\narterial pressure in all the arteries. Dopamine also decreased the arterial\npressure of arteries except for the ALAs, in which pressure was increased.\nAmong the neurohormones exerting excitatory effects on the valves, only Glu\ndepolarized the membrane potential of valve muscle cells. The glutamatergic\nagonists kainate and quisqualate also depolarized the valve muscle cells of\nthe AMA. Excitatory junctional potentials produced in the valves of the AMA in\nresponse to the stimulation of a VE were blocked by the glutamatergic\nantagonists Joro spider toxin and MK-801.

The metabolically produced lactic\nacid causes an intramuscular acidosis that must be cleared, either\nvia net transport out of the muscle or by conversion to glycogen,\nthereby replenishing the muscle energy store. Trout muscle has been shown to\nretain lactate and utilise it as a substrate for in situ glycogen\nresynthesis. The giant sarcolemmal vesicle preparation was used to\ncharacterise the potential for lactate loss from white muscle of rainbow\ntrout. Minimal lactate loss was expected due to the requirement within the\nintramuscular compartment of lactate for glycogen resynthesis. The sarcolemma\nwas found to be highly resistant to lactate loss, with efflux rates\napproximately 500-fold lower than influx rates [0.049±0.006 nmol\nmg-1 min-1 (N=21) versus\n26.4±6.3 nmol mg-1 min-1 (N=5),\nrespectively, at 25 mmol l-1 lactate concentration]. Lactate efflux\nwas linear over the range 10-250 mmol l-1 lactate, and greatest\nunder conditions when intravesicular pH was lower than extravesicular pH, but\nwas unaffected by α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, a known inhibitor of\nlactate transport. These results suggest that lactate is relatively impermeant\nto the trout white muscle membrane and any lactate loss occurs via\npassive diffusion. This resistance to lactate diffusion can explain why trout\nmuscle retains lactate post-exercise, despite transmembrane gradients that\nshould favour net efflux."},{"title":"Cloning of a muscle-specific calpain from the American lobster\nHomarus americanus: expression associated with muscle atrophy and\nrestoration during moulting","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/3/561","abstract":"A cDNA (1977 bp) encoding a crustacean calpain (Ha-CalpM; GenBank accession\nno.

Trout were maintained for 6\ndays on one of four diets of increasing sodium concentration (0.25 mmol\ng-1, 0.51 mmol g-1, 0.76 mmol g-1 and 1.27\nmmol g-1, which corresponds to 0.6%, 1.2%, 1.8% and 3% sodium by\nmass, respectively).

Despite higher\nmitochondrial densities the aerobic metabolic capacities per g wet mass,\nestimated from measurements of maximal activities of key metabolic enzymes,\nare lower in icefish compared to red-blooded species. This apparent\nincongruity can be explained by the significantly lower mitochondrial cristae\nsurface area per unit mitochondrion volume in icefishes (C. aceratus,\n20.8±1.6 μm-1; C. rastrospinosus,\n25.5±1.8 μm-1) compared to red-blooded species (N.\ncoriiceps, 33.6±3.0 μm-1; G. gibberifrons,\n37.7±3.6 μm-1). Consequently, the cristae surface area\nper unit muscle mass is conserved at approximately 9\nm2g-1. Although high mitochondrial densities in icefish\nmuscle do not enhance aerobic metabolic capacity, they may facilitate\nintracellular oxygen movement because oxygen is more soluble in lipid,\nincluding the hydrocarbon core of intracellular membrane systems, than in\naqueous cytoplasm. This may be particularly vital in icefish, which have\nlarger oxidative muscle fibres compared to red-blooded nototheniods (C.\naceratus, 2932±428 μm2; C. rastrospinosus,\n9352±318 μm2; N. coriiceps, 1843±312μ\nm2; G. gibberifrons, 2103±194μ\nm2). These large fibres contribute to a relatively low\ncapillary density, which is partially compensated for in icefish by a high\nindex of tortuosity in the capillary bed (C. aceratus=1.4, N.\ncoriiceps=1.1)."},{"title":"Identification of magnetically responsive neurons in the marine mollusc\nTritonia diomedea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/2/381","abstract":"Behavioral experiments have demonstrated that the marine mollusc\nTritonia diomedea can use the Earth's magnetic field as an\norientation cue.

Peritubular cyanide (CN, 0.3 mmol\nl-1) reduced [ATP]i to 0.08 mmol l-1 in less\nthan 2 min; however, Vbl dropped to -8 mV and\nRpc increased to 3150.8 kΩ in 8 min, while the\nK+-conductance of the basolateral membrane disappeared. Upon\nwashout of CN, Vbl and Rpc returned to\ncontrol values within 2 min, and the basolateral membrane recovered its\nK+-conductance. The recovery of normal [ATP]i took 15\nmin.

To determine\nwhether the restoration of KAAT1 residues to their GABA transporter GAT1\ncation-binding equivalents might abolish its K+ but not its\nNa+ recognition site, we constructed a multiple mutant in which\nnine divergent KAAT1 residues were mutated back to the conserved form of the\nsuperfamily. To investigate the amino-acid-binding site, we constructed\nseveral single mutants that had been identified in GAT1. Wild-type (WT) or\nmutant cRNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes and the effects of\nexternal amino acids and ions upon labeled leucine uptake and\nsubstrate-induced currents were examined.The multiple mutant exhibited no amino-acid-induced currents, indicating\nthat one or more of the mutated residues are crucial for function. W75L and\nR76E mutations in the first transmembrane helix of KAAT1 led to results\nequivalent to those observed in the corresponding mutants of GAT1; namely,\nsubstrate (leucine) uptake and substrate-evoked net inward current were\nseverely curtailed. The KAAT1 A523S mutant, which corresponds to a serotonin\ntransporter mutant that is thought to render Li+ equivalent to\nNa+ as a co-transported ion, functioned no differently to WT.The effects of mutation Y147F in the third transmembrane helix of KAAT1\nwere dramatically different from the equivalent mutation, Y140F, in GAT1.\nAlthough kinetic characteristics, expression levels and plasma membrane\nlocalization were all similar in Y147F and WT, the Y147F mutant exhibited a\nsevenfold increase in labeled leucine uptake by Xenopus oocytes in\nNa+ buffer. This increase is in sharp contrast to the complete loss\nof uptake activity in the GAT1 Y140F mutant. KAAT1 Y147F also differed from WT\nin cation selectivity and substrate spectrum, as revealed by\namino-acid-induced net inward currents that were measured with a two-electrode\nvoltage clamp.Amino-acid-independent currents induced by Li+ and\nNa+ chloride salts were observed in both WT and the Y147F mutant.\nThe Li+-induced current was 30% higher in Y147F than in WT, whereas\nno substrate-independent K+-induced currents above control levels\nwere detected either in WT or Y147F. These results suggest that transport of\nK+, the physiological co-substrate in insect midgut, is tightly\ncoupled to that of amino acids in KAAT1, in contrast to the independence of\ncation and amino acid transport in the closely related cation amino acid\ntransporter channel, CAATCH1."},{"title":"Copepod feeding currents: flow patterns, filtration rates and energetics","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/2/255","abstract":"Particle image velocimetry was used to construct a quasi 3-dimensional\nimage of the flow generated by the feeding appendages of the calanoid copepod\nTemora longicornis.

The B cell is a non-tympanal\nreceptor common to all moths that has been suggested to respond to sound, but\nwe found no evidence of this and suggest that its acoustic responsiveness is\nan artifact arising from its proprioceptive function.

The results of this\nwork indicate that MAP is a major protein in M. galloprovincialis\nsemen, with dual presence in both sperm cells and cell-free seminal fluid.\nShortly after spawning, the released sperm mass is subdivided in diffused\ncloudy-like and thread-shaped `clots', in which a soluble-phase MAP may\npersist as long as the clots keep their compact form. Additional experiments\ninvolving the incubation of spawned spermatozoa at increasing Triton X-100\nconcentrations demonstrated that MAP is also strongly associated with sperm\ncells. These results were further validated by immunofluorescent staining,\nwhich revealed that MAP is localized in the mid-piece region of spawned\nspermatozoa. This unexpected finding raises the possibility that MAP may play\na role in sperm fertility in bivalves. Using whole-mount histology and\nmicromanipulation techniques, we studied the structural patterning of the\nmantle gonad-duct network and assessed the sampling of luminal contents from\nthe ducts. Of particular interest is the observation that MAP content in the\nluminal fluid increases from the lumen of the spermatogenic tubules to that of\nthe collecting gonad ducts, where MAP is detected at a very high\nconcentration.

When the myogenic activity of the heart muscle \nwas pharmacologically isolated from the ganglionic drive by applying a \nglutamatergic antagonist, Joro spider toxin (JSTX), the spontaneous muscle \ncontraction caused a hyperpolarizing deflection in the CG neuron. Under \nspecific conditions made by JSTX and tetrodotoxin, the CG burst became \nentrained to the myogenic rhythm. These results suggest that the \nLigia CG neurons have tension sensitivity in addition to their \npacemaker and motoneuronal functions.

Rhodamine-labelled neurons were identified in vitro \nprior to recording, and whole-cell K+ and Ca2+ currents \nwere measured. All neurons expressed transient and sustained outward \nK+ currents, but Kenyon cells expressed higher relative amounts of \ntransient A-type K+ (IK,A) currents than sustained \ndelayed rectifier K+ current (IK,V). The current density \nof the IK,V was significantly higher in projection neurons than in \nKenyon cells. The voltage-dependency of K+ currents at positive \nmembrane potentials was linear in Kenyon cells, but N-shaped in projection \nneurons. Blocking of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ currents transformed \nthe N-shaped voltage-dependency into a linear one, indicating activation of \ncalcium-dependent K+ currents (IK,Ca). The densities of \ncurrents through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels did not differ \nbetween the two neuron classes and the voltage-dependency of current \nactivation was similar.

(1) What is the effect of these pollutants on \nthe rate of oxygen consumption \n(ṀO2) at \ndifferent levels of exercise and (2) why does ammonia accumulate within these \nfish, when the low external pH should favour the diffusion of NH3 \nacross the gills? Mean \nṀO2 of fish in \nCLP and control (normal pH and no added copper) conditions were not \nsignificantly different from each other at any level of exercise. This \nsuggests that exposure to CLP was not a `loading' factor at any level of \nactivity.

There was no \nevidence from cardiovascular variables, such as heart rate and cardiac output, \nto suggest any changes in the oxygen transport system to compensate for any \npossible reduction in branchial gas exchange. Thus, it is suggested that \noxygen exchange and transport do not limit the swimming performance of CLP \ntrout, but that exposure to CLP reduces the maximum demand for O2, \ni.e. it is a limiting factor.The accumulation of ammonia in the plasma and white muscles during exposure \nto CLP has already been implicated in reducing the swimming performance of \nbrown trout.

The drag force, and \nhence the cost of locomotion, experienced by blue crabs is shown to be a \nfunction of the body orientation angle relative to the flow. Rather than \nadopting a fixed orientation that minimizes the drag, blue crabs decrease \ntheir relative angle (increase drag) when odor is present in low speed flow, \nwhile assuming a drag-minimizing posture under other conditions. The \nmotivation for crabs to adopt an orientation with larger drag appears to \nrelate to their ability to acquire chemical signal information for odor \ntracking. In particular, when orienting at a smaller angle relative to the \nflow direction, more concentrated odor filaments arrive at the antennules to \nmediate upstream movement, allowing a more useful bilateral comparison between \nthe appendage chemosensors to be made. Blue crabs respond to conflicting \ndemands by weighting the degree of drag minimization in proportion to the \npotential magnitude of the drag cost and the potential benefit of acquiring \nchemosensory cues. Higher flow velocity magnifies the locomotory cost of a \nhigh drag posture, thus in swift flows crabs minimize drag and sacrifice their \nability to acquire olfactory cues."},{"title":"Proliferation of myogenic progenitor cells following feeding in the \nsub-antarctic notothenioid fish Harpagifer bispinis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/1/163","abstract":"Feeding metabolism and the activation of myogenic progenitor cells were \ninvestigated in the fast myotomal muscle of the sub-Antarctic fish \nHapagifer bispinis acclimatized to either simulated summer (10°C; \n18 h:6 h light:dark) or simulated winter (5°C; 6 h:18 h light:dark) \nconditions.

Although\noccupying only a small portion of the cross-sectional area, the notochord\nprovides the body with 75% of its total EI and 80% of total\nC, by virtue of its high E, ranging from 4 to 8 MPa, which\nis an order of magnitude greater than that of the whole body. Thus, as the\nbody's primary source of EI and C, the notochord determines\nthe passive (i.e. internal, non-muscular) mechanical behavior of the swimming\nhagfish. EI and C covary inversely and non-linearly such\nthat as C increases, EI decreases. However, the bending\nmoments M (Nm) produced by each property increase proportionally, and\nthe ratio of stiffness to damping moments, also known as the amplification\nratio at resonance, is nearly invariant (approximately 7) with changes in\ndriving frequency. If the body operates in life at or near resonance, the\nvariables EI and C interact over a range of swimming speeds\nto produce passive mechanical stability."},{"title":"Magnetic compass orientation in European robins is dependent on both wavelength and intensity of light","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/24/3845","abstract":"Magnetic compass orientation in birds has been shown to be light dependent.\nResults from behavioural studies indicate that magnetoreception capabilities\nare disrupted under light of peak wavelengths longer than 565 nm, and shifts\nin orientation have been observed at higher light intensities\n(43-44×1015 quanta s-1 m-2).

We found that the SR\naccumulated Ca2+ more rapidly and to a greater concentration\n(1043±189 μmol l-1 Ca2+, 1138±173μ\nmol l-1 Ca2+, and 1095±142 μmol\nl-1 Ca2+ at 7°C, 14°C and 21°C,\nrespectively) when stimulated with physiological AP waveforms at physiological\nfrequencies compared with 200 ms SQ pulses at the same frequencies\n(664±180 μmol l-1 Ca2+, 474±75 μmol\nl-1 Ca2+ and 367±42 μmol l-1\nCa2+ at 7°C, 14°C and 21°C, respectively). Also, and in\ncontrast to 200 ms SQ pulse stimulation, temperature had little effect on\nsteady-state SR Ca2+ accumulation during AP stimulation.\nFurthermore, we observed SR-Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the\nL-type Ca2+ channel current (ICa) at 7°C, 14°C\nand 21°C, providing additional evidence of maintained SR function in fish\nhearts over an acute range of temperatures.

During the larval stage and in\njuveniles younger than 100 dph, two classes of visual pigment were found, with\nwavelengths of maximum absorbance (λmax) at approximately\n425 nm and 535 nm. Following double cone formation, from 40 dph onwards, the\nshort wavelength-sensitive pigment was recorded in single cones and the longer\nwavelength-sensitive pigment in double cones. From 100 dph, a gradual shift in\nthe λmax towards longer wavelengths was observed in both\ncone types. By 160 dph, and in adults, all single cones had aλ\nmax at approximately 475 nm while theλ\nmax in double cones ranged from 545 to 575 nm. The\nrelationships between the λmax and the ratio of\nbandwidth:λmax, for changes in either chromophore or opsin,\nwere modelled mathematically for the long-wavelength-sensitive visual\npigments. Comparing our data with the models indicated that changes inλ\nmax were not mediated by a switch from an A1 to\nA2 chromophore, rather a change in opsin expression was most\nlikely. The shifts in the λmax of the visual pigments occur\nat a stage when the juvenile fish begin feeding in deeper, tanninstained\nestuarine waters, which transmit predominantly longer wavelengths, so the\nspectral sensitivity changes may represent an adaptation by the fish to the\nchanging light environment."},{"title":"Effects of temperature on intracellular [Ca2+] in trout atrial\nmyocytes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/23/3641","abstract":"Acute temperature change can be cardioplegic to mammals, yet certain\nectotherms maintain their cardiac scope over a wide temperature range.

Neither hatching nor hatching synchrony was affected by removal of\nthe region of the optic peduncle from the compound eye—retina complex to\nthe MI: the circatidal rhythm also remained. Removal of the MI probably caused\ndamage to the sinus gland and the bundle of axons running from the sinus gland\nto the X organ. Nevertheless, maintenance of highly synchronized hatching\nindicates that the X organ—sinus gland system is not related to\nhatching. Hatching and hatching synchrony were not affected by dorsal-half\ncuts of the MT: the timing of hatching was not affected either. By contrast,\ntransverse and ventral-half cuts of the MT caused severe damage to most\nfemales; hatching of many females was suppressed, while hatching of some\nfemales was either periodic, at intervals of approximately 24 h, or arrhythmic\nfor a few days. The bundle of neuronal axons is tangled in the MT, and the\naxons inducing hatching pass through the ventral half of the MT. Complete\nincision of these axon bundles may have suppressed hatching. Incomplete\nincision of the axon bundle or partial damage to the neurons may have caused\nperiodic or arrhythmic patterns of hatching. There are two possible roles for\nMT in hatching. One possibility is that neurons in the MT only induce hatching\nunder the control of the circatidal pacemaker located in a site somewhere\nother than the optic peduncle. Another possibility is that the circatidal\npacemaker is actually present in the MT. The second possibility seems more\nplausible.

When the enterins were\napplied to the aorta, the basal tonus of the arterial muscles was diminished.\nThe enterins also decreased the contraction amplitude of the anterior aorta\nevoked either by the application of an Aplysia cardioactive peptide,\nNdWFamide, or by the stimulation of a nerve innervating the aorta (the vulvar\nnerve).

In the presence of 4-AP, the\nenterins failed to inhibit the muscle contraction evoked by the vulvar nerve\nstimulation, suggesting that the inhibition is mainly due to the activation of\nthe 4-AP-sensitive K+ channels. The inhibition of the\nNdWFamide-evoked contraction by the enterin was not, however, affected by\n4-AP.

Here, we present the first biological application of\nstereo-DPIV, an engineering technique that allows simultaneous calculation of\nU, V and W velocity vectors. We quantified the wakes of\nrainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, 16.5-21.5 cm total body length,\nBL), swimming steadily in a recirculating flow tank at a slow\ncruising speed of 1.2 BL s-1. These data extend the\ncomparative basis of current hydromechanical data on the wakes of\nfree-swimming fishes to the salmoniforms and are used to test current\nhypotheses of fin function by calculations of mechanical performance and\nFroude efficiency.Stereo-DPIV wake images showed three-dimensional views of oscillating jet\nflows high in velocity relative to free-stream values. These jet flows are\nconsistent with the central momentum jet flows through the cores of shed\nvortex rings that have been previously viewed for caudal fin swimmers using\ntwo-dimensional DPIV. The magnitude and direction of U, V and\nW flows in these jets were determined over a time series of 6-8\nconsecutive strokes by each of four fish.Although the fish swam at the same relative speed, the absolute magnitudes\nof U, V and W were dependent on individual because of body\nsize variation. Vertical flows were small in magnitude (<1 cm\ns-1) and variable in direction, indicating limited and variable\nvertical force production during slow, steady, forward swimming. Thus, in\ncontrast to previous data from sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) and\nmackerel (Scomber japonicus), the trout homocercal caudal fin does\nnot appear to generate consistent vertical forces during steady swimming.\nU flows were of the order of 3-6 cm s-1; lateral flows\nwere typically strongest, with W magnitudes of 4-6 cm s-1.\nSuch strong lateral flows have also been shown for more derived euteleosts\nwith homocercal caudal fins.The ratios of the magnitudes of wake flow,\nU/(U+V+W), which is a flow equivalent to\nmechanical performance, were also dependent on individual and ranged from 0.32\nto 0.45, a range similar to the range of mechanical performance values\npreviously determined using standard two-dimensional DPIV methods for caudal\nfin locomotion by more derived euteleosts. Strong lateral jet flow appears to\nbe a general feature of caudal fin locomotion by teleosts and may reflect the\nnature of undulatory propulsion as a posteriorly propagated wave of bending.\nFroude efficiency (ηp) was independent of individual; meanη\np was 0.74, which is similar to previous findings for\ntrout."},{"title":"Ultraviolet colour perception in European starlings and Japanese quail","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/21/3299","abstract":"Whereas humans have three types of cone photoreceptor, birds have four\ntypes of single cones and, unlike humans, are sensitive to ultraviolet light\n(UV, 320-400 nm).

Total cardiac output, systemic\nvascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, heart rate and cardiac\nstroke volume were derived from these measurements. Anaesthetised turtles\nshowed cardiovascular characteristics that were similar to those of\nnon-apnoeic non-anaesthetised turtles, because anaesthesia blocked the\ncholinergically mediated constriction of the pulmonary artery that is normally\nassociated with apnoea. As a result, the anaesthetised turtles exhibited a\nlarge net left-to-right shunt, and the adrenergic responses could be observed\nwithout confounding changes resulting from apnoea.

Thus, we conclude\nthat, independent of whether the pulmonary vascular resistance is modulated\n(as during apnoea) or the systemic resistance is modulated with adrenergic\nmechanisms (as shown here), the consequences on the cardiac shunt patterns are\nthe same because they are determined primarily by the ratios of the pulmonary\nand systemic resistance."},{"title":"Sexual maturation and reproductive zinc physiology in the female squirrelfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/21/3367","abstract":"Female squirrelfish (Holocentridae) accumulate higher concentrations of\nhepatic zinc than any other known organism.

The\ncardiovascular responses to hypercarbia in the intact fish included a\nsignificant bradycardia (from 75.0±1.6 to 69.0±2.0 beats\nmin-1; means ± S.E.M.; N=16), an increase in dorsal\naortic blood pressure (from 30.8±1.5 to 41.9±2.5 mmHg;\nN=16) and a rise in systemic vascular resistance (from 1.1±0.1\nto 1.4±0.1 mmHg ml-1 kg-1 min-1;\nN=16). Removal of the first gill arch or pre-treatment with the\nmuscarinic receptor antagonist atropine prevented the hypercarbic bradycardia\nwithout affecting the pressure or resistance responses. Correlation analysis,\nhowever, revealed shallow but significant inverse relationships between water\nPCO2 and cardiac frequency in both atropinised\n(r2=0.75) and gill-extirpated\n(r2=0.90) fish, suggesting a direct mild effect of\nCO2 on cardiac function. The ventilatory response to hypercarbia in\nthe intact fish consisted of an increase in ventilation amplitude (from\n0.62±0.06 to 1.0±0.13 cm; N=16) with no change in\nbreathing frequency. Removal of the first gill arch lowered resting breathing\nfrequency and prevented the statistically significant elevation of breathing\namplitude. Gill extirpation, however, did not totally abolish the positive\ncorrelation between water PCO2 and ventilation\namplitude (r2=0.84), suggesting the presence of additional\n(although less important) chemoreceptive sites that are not confined to the\nfirst gill arch. Plasma catecholamine levels were elevated during hypercarbia,\nand this response was unaffected by prior gill extirpation.To assess whether the CO2 chemoreceptors of the first gill arch\nwere sensing water and/or blood PCO2, bolus\ninjections of CO2-enriched water or saline were made into the\nbuccal cavity or caudal vein, respectively.

Attempts to\nassociate different eye movements with either the expression of different\nmyosins or the activity of particular EOM fiber types are complicated by the\nmolecular heterogeneity of several of the fiber types, and by electromyography\nstudies showing that the majority of extraocular motor units participate in\nboth fast and slow eye movements.

Each transfer function exhibited an inverted `V'\nor `U' shape, with the velocity of TM motion peaking in the mid-frequency\nrange and becoming poorer at lower and higher frequencies.

The objective of these computations was to\ninvestigate the fluid dynamics of force production associated with the\nflapping aquatic flight of the bird wrasse Gomphosus varius. For this\ncomputational work, we used the geometry of the wrasse and its pectoral fin,\nand previously measured fin kinematics, as the starting points for\ncomputational investigation of three-dimensional (3-D) unsteady fluid\ndynamics. We performed a 3-D steady computation and a complete set of 3-D\nquasisteady computations for a range of pectoral fin positions and surface\nvelocities. An unstructured, grid-based, unsteady Navier—Stokes solver\nwith automatic adaptive remeshing was then used to compute the unsteady flow\nabout the wrasse through several complete cycles of pectoral fin oscillation.\nThe shape deformation of the pectoral fin throughout the oscillation was taken\nfrom the experimental kinematics. The pressure distribution on the body of the\nbird wrasse and its pectoral fins was computed and integrated to give body and\nfin forces which were decomposed into lift and thrust. The velocity field\nvariation on the surface of the wrasse body, on the pectoral fins and in the\nnear-wake was computed throughout the swimming cycle. We compared our\ncomputational results for the steady, quasi-steady and unsteady cases with the\nexperimental data on axial and vertical acceleration obtained from the\npectoral fin kinematics experiments. These comparisons show that steady state\ncomputations are incapable of describing the fluid dynamics of flapping fins.\nQuasi-steady state computations, with correct incorporation of the\nexperimental kinematics, are useful when determining trends in force\nproduction, but do not provide accurate estimates of the magnitudes of the\nforces produced.

We therefore determined egg and hatchling composition and\nthe development of embryonic respiration in the Australian pelican\nPelecanus conspicillatus, which lays one of the largest eggs (140-210\ng) with an altricial developmental mode. The small yolk fraction (21%) is\ntypical of all pelecaniforms; however, we found that intraspecific variability\nin fresh egg mass was related to water content (principally in the albumen),\nbut independent of yolk mass (mean 13 g dry mass). P. conspicillatus\neggs have, on average, 635 kJ of energy, irrespective of egg mass across the\nwhole range of egg mass.The embryonic developmental pattern of O2 consumption and\nCO2 production showed clear plateaus lasting 2-3 days immediately\nprior to internal pipping, resembling the typical precocial pattern. However,\nthe rate of pre-internal pipping O2 consumption was low in\ncomparison with that of precocial species of similar egg mass. There is no\nevidence to support the hypothesis that the observed plateau in rates of\nO2 uptake is due to a diffusion limitation of the eggshell gas\nconductance in this species. Embryonic metabolic rate nearly doubled during\nthe pipping period, but the mass-independent metabolic rate of the hatchling\nwas low in comparison with that of the resting adult. The total O2\nconsumed (11 063 ml) is equivalent to 217.3 kJ (or 34% of egg energy) based on\nindirect calorimetry and the observed respiratory exchange ratio of 0.71.\nThus, the cost of development (direct calorimetry) was 0.29 kJ J-1\nin the egg (mean egg mass 168 g), which is one of lowest reported values. As a\nresult, the production efficiency of pelican embryonic development was 61.6%,\nhigher than the average for birds in general (56.9%) and, in particular, of\nseabirds that have prolonged incubation periods on the basis of egg mass. High\nefficiency in embryonic development in this species was attained as a result\nof rapid embryonic growth later in incubation, low hatchling energy density\n(23.6 kJ g-1 dry matter) and dry matter content, low embryonic\nmetabolic rate throughout incubation and a shorter than expected incubation\nperiod of 33 days (predicted 36 days)."},{"title":"Hearing asymmetry and auditory acuity in the Australian bushcricket\nRequena verticalis (Listroscelidinae; Tettigoniidae;\nOrthoptera)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/18/2935","abstract":"Fluctuating asymmetry in bilaterally placed sensory structures of insects\nmay be considered maladaptive; natural selection should favour a symmetrical\nsystem.

Olfactory sensitivity to Na+ may warn freshwater\nfish that they are reaching the limit of their osmotic tolerance when in an\nestuarine environment.

As a fly approaches an object, the image projected across its retina\nexpands, providing the fly with visual feedback that can be used either to\ntrigger a collision-avoidance maneuver or a landing response. To determine how\na fly makes the decision to land on or avoid a looming object, we measured the\nbehaviors generated in response to an expanding image during tethered flight\nin a visual closed-loop flight arena. During these experiments, each fly\nvaried its wing-stroke kinematics to actively control the azimuth position of\na 15°×15° square within its visual field. Periodically, the\nsquare symmetrically expanded in both the horizontal and vertical directions.\nWe measured changes in the fly's wing-stroke amplitude and frequency in\nresponse to the expanding square while optically tracking the position of its\nlegs to monitor stereotyped landing responses. Although this stimulus could\nelicit both the landing responses and collision-avoidance reactions, separate\npathways appear to mediate the two behaviors. For example, if the square is in\nthe lateral portion of the fly's field of view at the onset of expansion, the\nfly increases stroke amplitude in one wing while decreasing amplitude in the\nother, indicative of a collision-avoidance maneuver. In contrast, frontal\nexpansion elicits an increase in wing-beat frequency and leg extension,\nindicative of a landing response. To further characterize the sensitivity of\nthese responses to expansion rate, we tested a range of expansion velocities\nfrom 100 to 10 000° s-1. Differences in the latency of both the\ncollision-avoidance reactions and the landing responses with expansion rate\nsupported the hypothesis that the two behaviors are mediated by separate\npathways. To examine the effects of visual feedback on the magnitude and time\ncourse of the two behaviors, we presented the stimulus under open-loop\nconditions, such that the fly's response did not alter the position of the\nexpanding square. From our results we suggest a model that takes into account\nthe spatial sensitivities and temporal latencies of the collision-avoidance\nand landing responses, and is sufficient to schematically represent how the\nfly uses integration of motion information in deciding whether to turn or land\nwhen confronted with an expanding object."},{"title":"The locust frontal ganglion: a central pattern generator network controlling foregut rhythmic motor patterns","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/18/2825","abstract":"The frontal ganglion (FG) is part of the insect stomatogastric nervous\nsystem and is found in most insect orders.

The complete crayfish\nheart SERCA, identified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction\n(RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), consists of 4495 bp with\na 3060 bp open reading frame, coding for 1020 amino acids. This isoform\ndiffers from the previously identified axial abdominal (tail) muscle SERCA\nsolely in its C-terminal amino acids. The last nine amino acids of the tail\nmuscle isoform are replaced by 27 hydrophobic amino acids in the heart isoform\nthat have the potential to form an additional transmembrane domain. Consistent\nwith other invertebrate studies, Southern blot analysis suggested that the\nheart and tail muscle isoforms are encoded from the same gene that is equally\nrelated to SERCA-1, -2 and -3 of vertebrates. The tissue\ndistributions of these two isoforms have been assessed using isoform-specific\nprobes and northern analysis. A cardiac-specific probe bound only to a 5.8 kb\nspecies in heart and had minimal cross-hybridization with 7.6 and 5.8 kb\nspecies in eggs and no hybridization with tail muscle. A tail-isoform-specific\nprobe hybridized with a 4.5 kb species in tail muscle and cross-hybridized\nwith a 4.5 kb species in eggs and 8.8 kb in heart muscle. Both isoforms are\nexpressed in eggs suggesting that transcripts are formed early in development\nand are subsequently broadly expressed in all tissue types. Expression of the\ncardiac muscle SERCA isoform varied with the stage of moulting. Expression was\nhigh in intermoult and decreased in premoult.

Ca2+ entry into the proximal endolymph was faster\nthan into the distal fluid. Net Ca2+ movement across the saccular\nepithelium depended on the direction and intensity of the chemical gradient of\ncalcium between the Ringer solution and the endolymph. Increasing the calcium\nconcentration in the Ringer solution up to 4.4 mmol l-1 provoked an\naccumulation of Ca2+ in both proximal and distal endolymphs, and\nequilibrium was reached about 30 min after the beginning of perfusion.\nPerfusion with calcium-free Ringer partially emptied the proximal compartment\nof calcium, whereas the calcium levels in the distal endolymph did not vary\nduring 70 min of perfusion. Verapamil (10-5 mol l-1) and\ncyanide (CN, 10-3 mol l-1) did not modify the\naccumulation of Ca2+ within the endolymph in the presence of a\nfavourable calcium chemical gradient. Furthermore the relationship between\nCa2+ net fluxes and the chemical calcium gradient across the\nsaccular epithelium was linear, indicating a passive diffusional mechanism\nvia a paracellular pathway.

We studied the role of thermal acclimation in the Chilean\nmouse-opossum, Thylamys elegans, by measuring MMR and BMR before and\nafter acclimation to cold or warm conditions. Following acclimation we also\nmeasured the mass of metabolically active organs, and the activity of a key\ndigestive enzyme, aminopeptidase-N. No significant effect of thermal\nacclimation (i.e. between cold- and warm-acclimated animals) was observed for\nbody mass, MMR, body temperature or factorial aerobic scope. However, the BMR\nof cold-acclimated animals was 30 % higher than for warm-acclimated\nindividuals. For organ mass, acclimation had a significant effect on the dry\nmass of caecum, liver and kidneys only.

Right and left atrial filling pressures and\nventricular outflow pressures of the pulmonary and systemic vessels could be\nmanipulated independently, permitting the establishment of large experimental\nintraventricular pressure gradients across the muscular ridge.

Therefore, the heart of Python appears to\nexhibit a large degree of ventricular flow separation as previously described\nfor varanid lizards.

The corresponding angle of the\nreaction force is much greater than body angle (mean 11 °) and the angle\nof the path of motion of the center of mass (mean approximately 0 °), thus\nstrongly supporting the classical model of heterocercal tail function for\nsteady horizontal locomotion. Vortex jet angle varies significantly with body\nangle changes during vertical maneuvering, but sharks show no evidence of\nactive reorientation of jet angle relative to body angle, as was seen in a\nprevious study on the function of sturgeon tail. Vortex jet orientation is\nsignificantly more inclined than the relatively horizontal jet generated by\nsturgeon tail vortex rings, demonstrating substantial differences in function\nin the heterocercal tails of sharks and sturgeon.We present a summary of forces on a swimming shark integrating data\nobtained here on the tail with previous data on pectoral fin and body\nfunction. Body orientation plays a critical role in the overall force balance\nand compensates for torques generated by the tail. The pectoral fins do not\ngenerate lift during steady horizontal locomotion, but play an important\nhydrodynamic role during vertical maneuvering."},{"title":"α1- and β-adrenoceptor stimulation differentially\nactivate p38-MAPK and atrial natriuretic peptide production in the perfused\namphibian heart","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/16/2387","abstract":"We investigated the activation of p38-MAPK by various adrenergic agents in\nthe perfused Rana ridibunda heart.

Analysis of fibre\nnumbers and sizes indicated that white and red myotomal muscles each develop\nin a different manner. In white muscle, the initial growth phase is dominated\nby fibre hypertrophy, while the later larval growth phase also includes\nsignificant hyperplasia. Red muscle growth is mainly due to hypertrophy within\nthe studied developmental period. The temperature regimes applied in the\npresent study may modify the mechanisms of muscle growth in different ways.\nFor white muscle, pre-hatching hyperplasia (i.e. proliferation of somitic\nwhite fibre precursor cells) is reduced under the cold regime whereas\npost-hatching hyperplasia is not. The inverse is true for white fibre\nhypertrophy. A similar situation is seen with red muscle except that\npost-hatching hyperplasia is low and refractory to temperature. Rates of\nincrease in relative amount of red muscle appear to depend not only upon\nspecies and temperature but also upon whether the fish have been reared under\nchanging or constant thermal regimes.

With this sliding joint, `stick-and-slip' sounds are\nproduced by rubbing the base of each antenna against the antennular plate.

The\npromotor muscle pulls the plectrum over the file during sound-producing and\nnon-sound-producing movements; a higher intensity of muscle activity is\nassociated with sound production. The promotor muscle is larger and attaches\nmore medially in sound-producing palinurids than in non-sound producers.

The mechanisms underlying these fast\nmovements were analysed by measuring movements of the body and legs from\nimages captured at 250 Hz.A forward jump of both adults and nymphs involves movements of the abdomen\nand the middle and hind pairs of legs. The abdomen is raised and swung\nforwards by flexion at the joint with the metathorax and at the joint between\nthe meso- and metathorax. At the same time, the tibiae of the hind and middle\nlegs are extended and their femora depressed. The femoro-tibial joints of the\nlegs are not fully flexed before a jump, and no structures in these joints\nappear to store muscular energy. The whole jumping sequence takes\napproximately 100 ms and results in take-off angles of 10-35° at\nvelocities of 0.6-0.8 m s-1 and with an acceleration of 10 m\ns-2. The abdominal angular velocity was 2000° s-1\nand the tip of the abdomen moved at linear velocities of some 1 m\ns-1, while the maximum rate of tibial extension was 4000°\ns-1.Rapid backward movements result either in the collapse of the body onto the\nground, with a displacement away from the stimulus of approximately half a\nbody length, or in the propulsion of the insect off its perch. Neither\nmovement involves curling of the abdomen.From a horizontal posture, the forward jumps result in a displacement of a\nfew body lengths. More lift can be generated in adults by elevating the hind\nwings as the abdomen is swung forwards and depressing them as the legs lose\ncontact with the ground. In this way, jumps can lead directly to flapping\nflight. Take-off into flight can, however, be achieved without the abdominal\nmovements seen during jumping.From a vertical posture, a forward jump propels the insect upwards and\nbackwards before it falls to the ground horizontally displaced from its perch.\nBackward movements result in the insect falling with little horizontal\ndisplacement from its perch."},{"title":"Fuel use and metabolic response to endurance exercise: a wind tunnel study of a long-distance migrant shorebird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/16/2453","abstract":"This study examines fuel use and metabolism in a group of long-distance\nmigrating birds, red knots Calidris canutus (Scolopacidae), flying\nunder controlled conditions in a wind tunnel for up to 10 h.

We have examined what wood\nants learn about a laterally placed, extended landmark, a wall, while walking\nparallel to it to reach a feeder and how they use this stored information to\nguide their path. Manipulation of the height of the wall and the ant's\nstarting distance from it reveals that ants maintain a desired distance from\nthe wall by keeping the image of the top of the wall at a particular retinal\nelevation. Ants can thus employ image matching both for returning to a place\nand for following a fixed route.Unlike many flying insects, an ant's direction of motion while walking is\nalways along its longitudinal body axis and, perhaps for this reason, it\nfavours its frontal retina for viewing discrete landmarks. We find that ants\nalso use their frontal retina for viewing a laterally placed wall. On a coarse\nscale, the ant's path along the wall is straight, but on a finer scale it is\nroughly sinusoidal, allowing the ant to scan the surrounding landscape with\nits frontal retina. The ant's side-to-side scanning means that the wall is\nviewed with its frontal retina for phases of the scanning cycle throughout its\ntrajectory. Details of the scanning pattern depend on the scene. Ants scan\nfurther to the side that is empty of the wall than to the side containing the\nwall, and they scan further into the wall side when the wall is of a lower\napparent height.

The results show that amino acid ligand-gating selectivity and current\nmagnitudes in Na+- and K+-containing media are\ndifferentially altered in CAATCH1 Y147F compared with the wild type. In the\nabsence of amino acid ligands, the channel conductance of Na+,\nK+ and Li+ that is observed in the wild type was reduced\nto virtually zero in Y147F. In the wild type, proline binding increased\nconductance strongly in Na+-containing medium and moderately in\nK+-containing medium, whereas in Y147F proline failed to elicit any\ncation currents beyond those of N-methyl-D-glucamine- or\nwater-injected oocytes. In the wild type, methionine binding strongly\ninhibited inward Na+ currents, whereas in Y147F it strongly\nstimulated inward currents in both Na+ and K+-containing\nmedia. Indeed, in Na+-containing medium, the relative potency\nranking for inward current inhibition in the wild type\n(Met>Leu>Gly>Phe>Thr) was similar to the ranking of\nligand-permissive gating of large inward currents in Y147F. In\nNa+-containing medium, current/voltage relationships elicited by\nligands in the wild type were complex and reversing, whereas in Y147F they\nwere linear and inwardly rectifying. In K+-containing medium,\ncurrent/voltage relationships remained non-linear in Y147F. Both wild-type and\nY147F currents were Cl--independent.

To determine how rotational\ninertia scales with body mass, we used the fact that the period of a physical\npendulum is proportional to its rotational inertia0.50, and\nmeasured rotational inertia in two groups of vertebrates with greatly\ndifferent body shapes: murine rodents (Mus domesticus and Rattus\nnorvegicus) and lizards (Iguana iguana and Varanus\nexanthematicus).

This suggests either that these animals are not\nconstrained by rotational inertia because of their relatively small size or\nthat larger rodents and lizards are poorer turners than smaller ones. The\nmurine rodents had a 3.0- to 4.9-fold lower rotational inertia than similarly\nsized lizards of either species.

The polymorphic\nciliate Tetrahymena vorax appears in two forms (`microstomes' and\n`macrostomes').

The non-specific, constitutive\nphagocytosis in microstomes thereby changes into a specific inducible process\nin macrostomes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the\nphagocytotic process in macrostomes is specifically aimed at catching T.\nthermophila. The two forms of phagocytosis represent an interesting model\nsystem for studying the mechanism whereby phagosomes are formed. The\nmacrostomal form capture deciliated and ciliated Tetrahymena\nthermophila, latex beads with diameters of 20.3 and 30.0 μm and small\nmicrostomal cells. However, the macrostomes select T. thermophila as\na prey when they have the opportunity to choose between deciliated T.\nthermophila and latex beads and between T. thermophila and\nmicrostomes. The non-selective formation of phagosomes seen in microstomes\nchanges to a highly selective process during the transformation to\nmacrostomes. Unlike microstomes, macrostomes do not form a closed vacuole\nafter capturing a latex bead, indicating that mechanical stimulation by the\nprey does not in itself trigger phagocytosis in the macrostomal form of T.\nvorax. Although macrostomes captured T. thermophila in\npreference to microstomes, phagocytosis of microstomes started immediately\nfollowing capture, indicating that the substance/molecule that triggers the\nformation of the phagosome is not specific for T. thermophila\ncells.After capturing a T. thermophila cell, the macrostomal cell, which\nnormally swims in a forward direction, reverses direction and swims backwards\nfor a short time before starting to rotate. Macrostomal cells did not change\ntheir swimming pattern after capturing a latex bead.

In many animal species, exposure to hypoxia\nstimulates cardiac output and is followed by an increase in cardiac mass. The\nworking hypothesis of the present study was that the hearts of these aquatic\nsalamanders exposed to 10-14 days of 5 % oxygen in a laboratory setting would\nbecome larger and would differentially express proteins that would help confer\ntolerance to hypoxia. During exposure to hypoxia, cardiac output increased, as\ndid hematocrit. Cardiac mass also increased, but mitotic figures were not\ndetected in the cardiac myocytes of colchicine-injected animals. The mass\nincrease was probably due to hypertrophy, although a very slow rate of\nhyperplasia cannot be ruled out. Representational difference analysis\nindicated that at least 14 mRNAs were expressed in hearts from the hypoxic\nanimals that were not expressed in hearts from normoxic animals. The\ndifferentially expressed genes were cloned and sequenced and confirmed as\ncoming from the ventricles of the hypoxic salamanders. Genes differentially\nexpressed include mitochondrial genes and genes for elongation factor 2, a\nprotein synthesis gene. The mechanical performance of buffer-perfused hearts\nisolated from normoxic and hypoxic animals did not differ. Acute responses to\nhypoxia were also measured. The rate of oxygen consumption of unanesthetized\nsalamanders in metabolism chambers decreased when chamber oxygen concentration\nwas reduced below 12 % oxygen.

The study explored the contribution of the left and right\nbrain hemispheres by performing tests with the right or left eye occluded. The\nresults show that pigeons can establish accurate bearings towards a\nnon-visible goal by using a global reference frame only. Furthermore, there\nwas a peak of searching activity at the location predicted by the global\nreference frame. Search at this location and directedness of the bearings were\nequally high with both right and left eye, suggesting that both brain\nhemispheres have the same competence level for these components of the task. A\nlateralization effect occurred when prominent landmarks were removed or\ntranslated. While the right brain hemisphere completely ignored such changes,\nthe left brain hemisphere was distracted by removal of landmarks. After\ntranslation of landmarks, the left but not the right brain hemisphere\nallocated part of the searching activity to the site predicted by the new\nlandmark position. The results show that a mainly geometric global visual\nreference frame is sufficient to determine exact bearings from familiar and\nunfamiliar release points.

Frog\njumping is a behavior in which the physical properties of the body and\nmusculotendon actuators may have evolved specifically to extend the limits of\nperformance. Little is known about how the joints of the frog contribute to\nand limit jumping performance. To address these issues, we developed a\nskeletal model of the frog Rana pipiens that contained realistic\nbones, joints and body-segment properties. We performed forward dynamic\nsimulations of jumping to determine the minimal number of joint degrees of\nfreedom required to produce maximal-distance jumps and to produce jumps of\nvaried take-off angles. The forward dynamics of the models was driven with\njoint torque patterns determined from inverse dynamic analysis of jumping in\nexperimental frogs. When the joints were constrained to rotate in the\nextension—flexion plane, the simulations produced short jumps with a\nfixed angle of take-off. We found that, to produce maximal-distance jumping,\nthe skeletal system of the frog must minimally include a gimbal joint at the\nhip (three rotational degrees of freedom), a universal Hooke's joint at the\nknee (two rotational degrees of freedom) and pin joints at the ankle,\ntarsometatarsal, metatarsophalangeal and iliosacral joints (one rotational\ndegree of freedom). One of the knee degrees of freedom represented a unique\nkinematic mechanism (internal rotation about the long axis of the tibiofibula)\nand played a crucial role in bringing the feet under the body so that maximal\njump distances could be attained. Finally, the out-of-plane degrees of freedom\nwere found to be essential to enable the frog to alter the angle of take-off\nand thereby permit flexible neuromotor control. The results of this study form\na foundation upon which additional model subsystems (e.g. musculotendon and\nneural) can be added to test the integrative action of the\nneuromusculoskeletal system during frog jumping."},{"title":"A comparison of propagated action potentials from tropical and temperate squid axons: different durations and conduction velocities correlate with ionic conductance levels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/12/1819","abstract":"To determine which physiological properties contribute to temperature\nadaptation in the squid giant axon, action potentials were recorded from four\nspecies of squid whose habitats span a temperature range of 20°C.

Bats adjust the temporal,\nspectral and intensity parameters of their echolocation calls depending on the\ncharacteristics of the returning echo signal. The mechanism of audio-vocal\nintegration in both mammals and birds is, however, still largely unknown.\nHere, we present behavioral evidence suggesting a novel audio-vocal control\nmechanism in echolocating horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum).\nThese bats compensate for even subtle frequency shifts in the echo caused by\nflight-induced Doppler effects by adjusting the frequency of their\necholocation calls. Under natural conditions, when approaching background\ntargets, the bats usually encounter only positive Doppler shifts. Hence, we\ncommonly believed that, during this Doppler-shift compensation behavior,\nhorseshoe bats use auditory feedback to compensate only for these increases in\necho frequency (=positive shifts) by actively lowering their call frequency\nbelow the resting frequency (the call frequency emitted when not flying and\nnot experiencing Doppler shifts). Re-investigation of the Doppler-shift\ncompensation behavior, however, shows that decreasing echo frequencies\n(=negative shifts) are involved as well: auditory feedback from frequencies\nbelow the resting frequency, when presented at similar suprathreshold\nintensity levels as higher echo frequencies, cause the bat's call frequency to\nincrease above the resting frequency. However, compensation for negative\nshifts is less complete than for positive shifts (22% versus 95%),\nprobably because of biomechanical restrictions in the larynx of bats.\nTherefore, Doppler-shift compensation behavior involves a quite different\nneural substrate and audio-vocal control mechanism from those previously\nassumed. The behavioral results are no longer consistent with solely\ninhibitory feedback originating from frequencies above the resting frequency.\nInstead, we propose that auditory feedback follows an antagonistic push/pull\nprinciple, with inhibitory feedback lowering and excitatory feedback\nincreasing call frequencies. While the behavioral significance of an active\ncompensation for echo frequencies below RF remains unclear, these behavioral\nresults are crucial for determining the neural implementation of audio-vocal\nfeedback control in horseshoe bats and possibly in mammals in general."},{"title":"The digestive tract of Nautilus pompilius (Cephalopoda,\nTetrabranchiata): an X-ray analytical and computational tomography study on\nthe living animal","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/11/1617","abstract":"Using X-ray analytical studies and computational tomography, the position\nof the digestive tract of the tetrabranchiate cephalopod Nautilus\npompilius L. was demonstrated in a living animal.

Most research on the role of these structures\nin fertilization has focused on chemical constituents and their influence on\nsperm—egg interaction. Here I test an alternative hypothesis that\naccessory structures play an important physical role in fertilization by\nincreasing the size and buoyancy of the egg, making it a better target for\nsperm. In the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus, the jelly coat\nincreases egg target size sixfold. At nonsaturating sperm concentrations,\nfertilization declined consistently following jelly coat removal by two\nindependent methods. Regression analysis using a standard fertilization\nkinetics model found that 54-73% of this decline on average was predicted by\nchanges in the rate of sperm—egg collision, resulting from changes in\negg target size and density. Sperm swimming speed, a key parameter in the\nmodel, did not vary as a function of sperm concentration or exposure to\negg-water. The organic cost of jelly is a fraction of that of the ovum,\nproviding an efficient means of extending target size beyond the ovum size\nthat is optimal for larval or juvenile development. These results support the\nhypothesis that physical attributes of jelly coats can account for a\nsignificant portion of their contribution to fertilization, and may help to\nexplain why coats and other accessory structures are often substantially\nlarger than expected from the nature of chemical interactions between egg and\nsperm."},{"title":"Respiratory adaptations in a deep-sea orbiniid polychaete from Gulf of Mexico brine pool NR-1: metabolic rates and hemoglobin structure/function relationships","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/11/1669","abstract":"Methanoaricia dendrobranchiata Blake (Polychaeta; Orbiniidae)\noccurs in large numbers in association with communities of the mussel\nBathymodiolus childressi at hydrocarbon seeps on the Louisiana Slope\nof the Gulf of Mexico.

The mechanical power developed during single running steps was\ncalculated from force-plate and high-speed video measurements as turkeys\naccelerated over a trackway. Steady-speed running steps and accelerations were\ncompared to determine how turkeys alter their running mechanics from a\nlow-power to a high-power gait. During maximal accelerations, turkeys\neliminated two features of running mechanics that are characteristic of\nsteady-speed running: (i) they produced purely propulsive horizontal ground\nreaction forces, with no braking forces, and (ii) they produced purely\npositive work during stance, with no decrease in the mechanical energy of the\nbody during the step. The braking and propulsive forces ordinarily developed\nduring steady-speed running are important for balance because they align the\nground reaction force vector with the center of mass. Increases in\nacceleration in turkeys correlated with decreases in the angle of limb\nprotraction at toe-down and increases in the angle of limb retraction at\ntoe-off. These kinematic changes allow turkeys to maintain the alignment of\nthe center of mass and ground reaction force vector during accelerations when\nlarge propulsive forces result in a forward-directed ground reaction force.\nDuring the highest accelerations, turkeys produced exclusively positive\nmechanical power. The measured power output during acceleration divided by the\ntotal hindlimb muscle mass yielded estimates of peak instantaneous power\noutput in excess of 400 W kg-1 hindlimb muscle mass. This value\nexceeds estimates of peak instantaneous power output of turkey muscle fibers.\nThe mean power developed during the entire stance phase increased from\napproximately zero during steady-speed runs to more than 150 W kg-1\nmuscle during the highest accelerations. The high power outputs observed\nduring accelerations suggest that elastic energy storage and recovery may\nredistribute muscle power during acceleration. Elastic mechanisms may expand\nthe functional range of muscle contractile elements in running animals by\nallowing muscles to vary their mechanical function from force-producing struts\nduring steady-speed running to power-producing motors during acceleration."},{"title":"Feeding patterns of Chelus fimbriatus (Pleurodira:\nChelidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/10/1495","abstract":"The kinematics of feeding on fish have been studied in the aquatic feeding\nspecialist Chelus fimbriatus, the fringed turtle, to provide a basic\ndescription of complete feeding cycles.

Estimates of lift from our circulation model\nwere sufficient to support body weight at all but the slowest speeds (1 and 3\nms-1). From comparisons of aerodynamic impulse derived from our\ncirculation analysis with the impulse estimated from whole-body acceleration,\nit appeared that our quasi-steady aerodynamic analysis was most accurate at\nintermediate speeds (5-11 ms-1). Despite differences in wing shape\nand wing loading, both species shifted from a vortex-ring to a\ncontinuous-vortex gait at 7 ms-1. We found that the shift from a\nvortex-ring to a continuous-vortex gait (i) was associated with a phase delay\nin the peak angle of attack of the proximal wing section from downstroke into\nupstroke and (ii) depended on sufficient forward velocity to provide airflow\nover the wing during the upstroke similar to that during the downstroke. Our\nkinematic estimates indicated significant variation in the magnitude of\ncirculation over the course the wingbeat cycle when either species used a\ncontinuous-vortex gait.

The steady-state active isometric forces following\nstretches of 9 mm on the descending limb of the force—length\nrelationship were always equal to or greater than the corresponding forces\nfrom the purely isometric contractions at the length at which the stretch was\nstarted.

The probability of urine\nrelease is greater during fights than during non-social activities or\ninactivity. The eventual winners are more likely to release urine during\nfights than the eventual losers. In both winners and losers, urine release is\ncoupled to offensive behaviours, and the probability of urine release\nincreases with increasing levels of aggression. In A. leptodactylus,\nurine is carried to the opponent by the forward-projecting gill currents.\nDuring spontaneous release, urine is fanned laterally with the aid of the\nexopodites of the maxillipeds. Aggressive behaviour is effective in\nintimidating blindfolded opponents only in conjunction with urine release:\nreceivers decrease offensive behaviour and increase defensive behaviour.\nAggressive behaviour alone does not intimidate opponents. The loser of a\nrecent fight is deterred equally well by a familiar and an unfamiliar\nopponent. Hence, in crayfish, individual recognition of the urine scent of a\ndominant individual does not appear to be significant for the maintenance of\ndominance hierarchies.

During starvation and moulting,\nV-ATPase activity decreases as a result of the dissociation of the\nV1 complex from the Vo complex. To determine whether\nsubunit biosynthesis is reduced during periods of enzyme inactivity, we\nmeasured the transcript levels and transcriptional activities of V-ATPase\ngenes.

Exposure to ETH\nstimulates the release of eclosion hormone (EH) which, in turn, activates a\nset of neurons containing crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) by elevating\ntheir levels of intracellular cyclic GMP. We characterized a set of non-CCAP\ncontaining neurons that also appear to be EH targets because of their response\nto cyclic GMP at ecdysis. The neurons did not display leucokinin-,\ndiuretic-hormone- or FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity. They are probably the\nbursicon-containing cells described previously. After release of EH, there is\na transient inhibition of the abdominal centers responsible for ecdysis.\nTransection experiments suggested that this suppression is via\ndescending inhibitory units from the suboesophageal and thoracic ganglia. The\nduration of this inhibition appears to depend on the levels of cyclic GMP and\ncan be extended by pharmacologically suppressing cyclic GMP breakdown. We\nfurther found that brief exposure to CO2 caused premature ecdysis.\nSince the CO2 treatment was effective only after EH release, it\nprobably acts by suppressing descending inhibition.

The burst-swimming\nperformance of 55 frogs was assessed using a high-speed digital camera, and\ntheir endurance capacity was measured in a constant-velocity swimming\nflume.The work-loop technique was used to assess maximum power production of\nwhole peroneus muscles at a cycle frequency of 6 Hz, while fatigue-resistance\nwas determined by recording the decrease in force and net power production\nduring a set of continuous cycles at 2 Hz. We found no significant\ncorrelations between measures of burst swimming performance and endurance\ncapacity, suggesting that there is no trade-off between these two measures of\nwhole-animal performance. In contrast, there was a significant negative\ncorrelation between peak instantaneous power output of the muscles at 6 Hz and\nthe fatigue-resistance of force production at 2 Hz (other correlations between\npower and fatigue were negative but non-significant). Thus, our data support\nthe suggestion that a physiological conflict between maximum power output and\nfatigue resistance exists at the level of vertebrate muscles.

In doing so, we aimed to\ntest the assumption that sprint speed is correlated with hindlimb length\nthrough its effect on stride length. Variation in maximal sprint speed is\ndetermined by variation in both stride length and frequency, but those species\nthat modulate their sprint speed mainly by altering stride length appear to\nattain the highest maximal speeds. At maximal sprint speed, long-limbed\nspecies take larger strides because of the positive effect of hindlimb length\non step length and floating distance.

The\ntemporal and spatial resolution of the resulting images is sufficient to\ndescribe the kinematics of specific muscles of the buccal mass and the\ninternal movements of the main structures responsible for grasping food, the\nradula and the odontophore. These observations suggest that a previously\nundescribed feature on the anterior margin of the odontophore, a fluid-filled\nstructure that we term the prow, may aid in opening the jaw lumen early in\nprotraction. Radular closing during swallowing occurs near the peak of\nprotraction as the radular stalk is pushed rapidly out of the odontophore.\nRetraction of the odontophore is enhanced by the closure of the lumen of the\njaws on the elongated odontophore, causing the odontophore to rotate rapidly\ntowards the esophagus. Radular opening occurs after the peak of retraction and\nwithout the active contraction of the protractor muscle 12 and is due, in\npart, to the movement of the radular stalk into the odontophore.

At a given speed and\nfish size, the rate of oxygen consumption\n(V̇O2) was\nsignificantly higher at 24 than at 18°C because of a higher net cost of\ntransport (1073-4617 J km-1 kg-1 at 18°C and\n2708-14895 J km-1 kg-1 at 24°C).

At a given speed and fish size, there were no\nsignificant effects of temperature on tail-beat frequency, tail-beat amplitude\nor stride length, but propulsive wavelength increased significantly with\ntemperature as a result of an increase in propulsive wave velocity. Thus, the\nmain effects of temperature on chub mackerel swimming were increases in both\nUmax,c and the net cost of swimming at 24°C. Like\nother fishes, S. japonicus apparently must recruit more slow,\noxidative muscle fibers to swim at a given sustainable speed at the lower\ntemperature because of the reduced power output. Thus, the 24°C mackerel\nreach a higher speed before they must recruit the fast, glycolytic fibers,\nthereby increasing Umax,c at 24°C. By quantifying\nin vivo the effects of temperature on the swimming performance of an\nectothermic species that is closely related to the endothermic tunas, this\nstudy also provides evidence that maintaining the temperature of the slow,\noxidative locomotor muscle at 6°C or more above ambient water temperature\nin tunas should significantly increase sustainable swimming speeds, but also\nincrease the energetic cost of swimming, unless cardiac output limits muscle\nperformance."},{"title":"In vivo membrane trafficking role for an insect\nN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor which is developmentally regulated\nin endocrine cells","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/7/911","abstract":"The hexameric ATPase, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) is\nimplicated in the release of neurotransmitters and in mediating fusion between\nintracellular membranes.

Therefore, the disappearance of oocytes and the decomposition of the ovarian cavity caused by apoptosis during sex differentiation were male-specific events. In genetic all-females, apoptosis in a proportion of early diplotene oocytes was found in the undifferentiated gonads at 15–19 days post-hatching, probably as a result of programmed oocyte loss during ovarian development. These findings suggest that oocyte apoptosis is the mechanism of testicular and ovarian differentiation in zebrafish.\n      "},{"title":"Specialized olfactory receptor neurons mediating intra- and interspecific\nchemical communication in leafminer moths Eriocrania spp.\n(Lepidoptera: Eriocraniidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/7/989","abstract":"We performed a physiological and morphological characterization of sensilla\nauricillica in male Eriocrania semipurpurella moths.

Sensilla express ensembles of proteins, including odorant binding proteins (OBPs), olfactory receptors (ORs) and odor degrading enzymes (ODEs); odors are thought to be transported to ORs by OBPs and subsequently degraded by ODEs. These proteins belong to multigene families. The unique combinatorial expression of specific members of each of these gene families determines, in part, the phenotype of a sensillum and what odors it can detect. Furthermore, OBPs, ORs and ODEs are expressed in different cell types, suggesting the need for cell–cell communication to coordinate their expression. This report examines the OBP gene family. In Manduca sexta, the genes encoding PBP1Msex and GOBP2Msex are sequenced, shown to be adjacent to one another, and characterized together with OBP gene structures of other lepidoptera and Drosophila melanogaster. Expression of PBP1Msex, GOBP1Msex and GOBP2Msex is characterized in adult male and female antenna and in larval antenna and maxilla. The genomic organization of 25 D. melanogaster OBPs are characterized with respect to gene locus, gene cluster, amino acid sequence similarity, exon conservation and proximity to OR loci, and their sequences are compared with 14 M. sexta OBPs. Sensilla serve as portals of important behavioral information, and genes supporting sensilla function are presumably under significant evolutionary selective pressures. This study provides a basis for studying the evolution of the OBP gene family, the regulatory mechanisms governing the coordinated expression of OBPs, ORs and ODEs, and the processes that determine specific sensillum phenotypes.\n      "},{"title":"NaCl and fluid secretion by the intestine of the teleost Fundulus heteroclitus: involvement of CFTR","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/6/745","abstract":"\n        Sections of posterior intestine of the euryhaline killifish Fundulus heteroclitus adapted to sea water were stimulated by the calcium ionophore ionomycin (1 μmol l–1) in combination with agents to elevate intracellular cyclic AMP levels, 0.5 mmol l–1 dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (db-cAMP) with 0.1 mmol l–1 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Intestinal bag preparations from recently fed animals (but not from overnight unfed animals) changed from fluid absorption (+18.9±8.30 μl cm–2 h–1 , N=8) in the untreated control period to net fluid secretion after stimulation (–7.43±1.30 μl cm–2 h–1, N=8, P<0.01; means ± s.e.m.), indicative of the capacity of teleost intestine to undergo secretion. Posterior intestinal pieces mounted in vitro in Ussing-style membrane chambers showed net Cl– uptake (+2.245±0.633 μequiv cm–2 h–1, N=7) that turned to net secretion following stimulation by ionomycin + db-cAMP + IBMX (–3.809±1.22 μequiv cm–2 h–1, N=7, P<0.01). Mucosal application of the anion channel blocker 1 mmol l–1 diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC) after ionomycin + db-cAMP + IBMX treatment significantly reduced serosal-to-mucosal unidirectional Cl– flux (P<0.001), net Cl– flux (P<0.05), short-circuit current (Isc, P<0.001) and tissue conductance (Gt, P<0.001), while 0.1 mmol l–1 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-stilbene-disulphonic acid (DIDS, a blocker of anion exchange) was without effect. Stimulation by db-cAMP + IBMX (no ionomycin) significantly increased unidirectional fluxes, Isc and Gt but did not produce net Cl– secretion. Ionomycin alone produced a transient increase in Isc but had no effect on Gt and caused no significant changes in unidirectional or net Cl– fluxes. Addition of db-cAMP + IBMX after ionomycin treatment produced net secretion of Cl– and large increases in unidirectional fluxes and Gt. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) was immunocytochemically localized with a monoclonal mouse antibody to the carboxy terminus and found to be present in the cytoplasm and basolateral membranes of all enterocytes and in the brush-border membrane of some cells, whereas NKCC immunofluorescence, demonstrating the presence of the Na+/K+/2Cl– cotransporter, was present in the cytoplasm and brush-border membrane. We conclude that the teleost intestine is capable of salt and fluid secretion only if intracellular Ca2+ and cyclic AMP pathways are stimulated together and that this secretion appears to involve activation of CFTR ion channels in the apical membrane of a subpopulation of enterocytes.\n      "},{"title":"Cardiorespiratory responses of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) to severe hypoxia at three acclimation temperatures","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/6/759","abstract":"\n        In vivo measurements of the cardiovascular responses of anoxia-tolerant teleosts to severe prolonged hypoxia are limited.

While routine Q and fH values varied with temperature under normoxic conditions (Q10 values of 1.7 and 2.6, respectively), severe hypoxic exposure significantly depressed fH and Q to similar minimum values that were largely independent of acclimation temperature (Q10 values of 1.2). In contrast, the duration of cardiac depression and the subsequent time period during which carp could tolerate severe hypoxia were inversely related to acclimation temperature (24 h at 6°C, 6 h at 10°C, and 2.5 h at 6°C). Likewise, respiration rate during hypoxia showed a temperature dependence. An unusual finding was that cardiorespiratory status partially recovered during the latter stages of severe hypoxic exposure. We conclude that the cardiorespiratory responses to severe prolonged hypoxia in common carp involved a mixture of temperature-independent, temperature-dependent and time domain phases.\n      "},{"title":"Peripheral oxygen transport in skeletal muscle of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic notothenioid fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/6/769","abstract":"\n        Transcellular oxygen flux was modelled mathematically in the aerobic skeletal muscles of perciform fish species living at widely different temperatures (Antarctica, sub-Antarctica and the Mediterranean Sea). Using structural data derived from stereological analysis of electron micrographs, mean fibre PO2 was calculated on the basis of temperature-corrected rates of mitochondrial respiration and oxygen diffusion. The mean muscle fibre diameter (MFD) among Antarctic notothenioids was in the range 17–61 μm and mitochondrial volume density, Vv(mit,f), was 0.27–0.53, but capillary-to-fibre ratio varied only between 1.2 and 1.5. For a mean capillary PO2 of 6 kPa, the model predicted a mean tissue PO2 in the range 0.7–5.8 kPa at the estimated maximum aerobic capacity (ṀO2max). The lowest levels of tissue oxygenation were found in the pectoral muscle fibres of the icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus, which lacks the respiratory pigments haemoglobin and myoglobin. Red-blooded notothenioids found in the sub-Antarctic had a similar muscle fine structure to those caught south of the Antarctic Convergence, with an MFD of 20–41 μm and Vv(mit,f) of 0.27–0.33, resulting in an estimated mean PO2 of 4–5 kPa at ṀO2max. Mean tissue PO2 in the sub-Antarctic icefish Champsocephalus esox, with greater MFD and Vv(mit,f), 56 μm and 0.51, respectively, was calculated to exceed 1 kPa at winter temperatures (4°C), although oxidative metabolism was predicted to be impaired at the summer maximum of 10°C. At the high end of the thermal range, related perciform species from the Mediterranean had a negligible drop in intracellular PO2 across their small-diameter fibres, to a minimum of 5.4 kPa, comparable with that predicted for Trematomus newnesi from the Antarctic (5.6 kPa) with a similar MFD. These data suggest that, within a single phylogenetic group, integrative structural adaptations potentially enable a similar degree of tissue oxygenation over a 20°C range of environmental temperature in the red-blooded notothenioids, and that this is compromised by the lack of respiratory pigments in the icefishes. The mean capillary radius was 1.5 times greater in the two icefish than in the other notothenioids, and the model simulations indicate that the evolution of wide-bore capillaries is essential to maintain tissue oxygenation in the absence of respiratory pigments.\n      "},{"title":"Metabolic rate and respiratory gas-exchange patterns in tenebrionid beetles from the Negev Highlands, Israel","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/6/791","abstract":"\n        This study correlates the pattern of external gas exchange with the diel activity of nine species of tenebrionid beetle from the Negev Desert, Israel. The study species are active throughout the summer months when daytime temperatures are high and no rain falls. There were no differences in standard metabolic rate, determined by flow-through respirometry, among the nine species. All the nocturnally active beetles exhibited a form of continuous respiration, whereas the two diurnally active and one crepuscular species exhibited a cyclic form of respiration referred to as the discontinuous gas-exchange cycle (DGC). The DGCs recorded have a long flutter period consisting of miniature ventilations, and 29–48 % of the total CO2 output occurred during this period. In this study, the flutter period played an important role in the modulation of metabolic rate, in contrast to other studies in which the burst period has been shown to be important. We suggest that the long flutter period is important in reducing respiratory water loss in arid-dwelling arthropods. This study lends support to the hypothesis that discontinuous gas exchange is important in reducing respiratory water loss from beetles that need to minimise dessication because of the high water vapour pressure gradient they experience. If the use of underground burrows were responsible for the evolution of discontinuous gas exchange, then we would expect all nine tenebrionid species to use DGCs since both the nocturnally and diurnally active species bury in the sand during periods of inactivity. We conclude that the activity patterns of the beetles are more important than their habitat associations in designating the type of respiration used.\n      "},{"title":"Luminescence in ophiuroids (Echinodermata) does not share a common nervous control in all species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/6/799","abstract":"\n        Study of the control mechanisms of light emission in invertebrates shows the involvement of several neurotransmitters.

The aim of this work is to investigate the nature of control mechanisms of light emission in three luminous ophiuroid species, A. filiformis, O. aranea and O. californica, in order to see whether or not they share common mechanisms. Luminescence induced by general depolarisation of tissues using KCl (200 mmol l–1) shows different patterns, according to species. Only A. filiformis emits light in response to acetylcholine. In this species, the involvement of both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors is proposed, since atropine and tubocurarine (at 10–3 mol l–1) inhibited 99 % and 71 %, respectively, of the light emitted. Study of the subtypes of cholinergic receptors involved in photogenesis revealed that several subtypes of muscarinic receptors might be involved.

Hydrocarbons are not synthesized by the ovaries, but are delivered by hemolymph lipoproteins and accumulate within the basal oocytes. A native B. germanica hydrocarbon, [3H]3,11-dimethylnonacosane, injected into adult females of various ages, was taken up by the ovaries in relation to oocyte growth. Ovarian uptake of the hydrocarbon was low in day 0–1 females, increased dramatically between days 3 and 6 and declined sharply through oviposition on day 8–9; ovarian uptake of the hydrocarbon was low during a 21-day pregnancy that followed. [1-14C]Propionate, which becomes incorporated into methyl-branched hydrocarbons, was injected into 5-day-old vitellogenic females to monitor the de novo biosynthesis of hydrocarbons and the time course of hydrocarbon deposition in the ovary. Propionate was rapidly incorporated into hydrocarbons within 4 h. Hydrocarbon uptake by the ovaries, however, was three times higher 24 h after injection than 4 h after injection, showing that hydrocarbons are slowly and continuously deposited in oocytes. This result was confirmed with topical application of [3H]3,11-dimethylnonacosane: ovarian uptake was three times higher after 24 h than after 4 h. In vitro incubations of sternites, which synthesize hydrocarbons, with [14C]propionate and ovaries, showed that both hemolymph and purified high-density lipophorin facilitated ovarian uptake of newly synthesized hydrocarbons; maximum uptake occurred with 10 % hemolymph or 1 mg ml–1 high-density lipophorin. These results were confirmed with sternites treated with [3H]3,11-dimethylnonacosane and co-incubated with ovaries. This is the first report to show that copious amounts of maternal hydrocarbons are provisioned in oocytes and to demonstrate the existence of a hydrocarbon transport pathway involving hemolymph high-density lipophorin.\n      "},{"title":"The use of landmarks and panoramic context in the performance of local vectors by navigating honeybees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/6/807","abstract":"\n        Bees seem to use landmarks to segment familiar routes. They can associate, with a landmark, a memory that encodes the direction and distance of the path segment between that landmark and the next. The expression of the memory results in the performance of a local vector matching the distance and direction of the path segment. The memories of path segments appear to be ‘chained’ together, so that the performance of one local vector is sometimes sufficient to elicit the subsequent local vector, even in the absence of the associated landmark. We have investigated the effect of visual panoramic context on the expression of local vectors. Bees were trained to fly along a narrow channel to collect sucrose from a feeder positioned partway along it. Panoramic context was provided by various types of patterning on the walls. The channel was partitioned into different segments using landmarks of two kinds: a boundary landmark that marked a change in the pattern on one or both side-walls of the channel, and an isolated landmark, consisting of a baffle through which the bee passed, for which the wall pattern was the same before as after. In tests, we removed the feeder and analysed the search distribution of the bees for various arrangements of landmarks. Altering the spatial relationship between landmarks has different consequences for the two types of landmark. If the final boundary landmark is shifted, the centre of the search distribution shifts by approximately the same amount. Changes in the position of an isolated landmark have a weaker effect. In the absence of the final context, the search is disrupted. We suggest that for local vectors to be expressed the surrounding panoramic context needs to be appropriate. A comparison of search patterns from two different training configurations of landmarks supports the hypothesis that local vector memories merely encode route segments and that global positional coordinates are not linked to landmark memories.\n      "},{"title":"Differing mechanisms of cold-induced changes in capillary supply in m. tibialis anterior of rats and hamsters","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/6/829","abstract":"\n        The physiological, metabolic and anatomical adaptations of skeletal muscle to chronic cold exposure were investigated in Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus), a species that defends core temperature, and Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), which may adopt a lower set point under unfavourable conditions. Animals were exposed to a simulated onset of winter in an environmental chamber, progressively shortening photoperiod and reducing temperature from 12 h:12 h L:D and 22°C to 1 h:23 h L:D and 5°C over 4 weeks. The animals were left at 4°C for a further 4 weeks to complete the process of cold-acclimation. M. tibialis anterior from control (euthermic) and cold-acclimated animals of similar mass showed a significant hyperactivity-induced hypertrophy in the rat, but a small disuse atrophy in the hamster. Little evidence was found for interconversion among fibre types in skeletal muscle on cold-acclimation, and only modest differences were seen in activity of oxidative or glycolytic enzymes in either species. However, adjustments in Type II fibre size paralleled the muscle hypertrophy in rat and atrophy in hamster. Cold-induced angiogenesis was present in the rat, averaging a 28 % increase in capillary-to-fibre ratio (C:F) but, as this was balanced by fibre hypertrophy across the whole muscle, there was no change in capillary density (CD). In contrast, the C:F was similar in both groups of hamsters, whereas CD rose by 33 % in line with fibre atrophy. Within distinct regions of the m. tibialis anterior, there was a correlation between angiogenesis and fibre size in rats, in which oxygen diffusion distance increased, but not in hamsters, in which there was a reduced oxygen diffusion distance. Consequently, the change in C:F was greatest (39 %) in the glycolytic cortex region of the m. tibialis anterior in rats. We conclude that non-hibernator and hibernator rodents improve peripheral oxygen transport following cold-acclimation by different mechanisms. In rats, an increase in fibre girth was accompanied by a true angiogenesis, while the improved apparent capillary supply in hamsters was due to smaller fibre diameters. These responses are consistent with the strategies of resisting and accommodating, respectively, an annual fall in environmental temperature.\n      "},{"title":"Effects of metamorphosis on the aquatic escape response of the two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/6/841","abstract":"\n        Although numerous studies have described the escape kinematics of fishes, little is known about the aquatic escape responses of salamanders. We compare the escape kinematics of larval and adult Eurycea bislineata, the two-lined salamander, to examine the effects of metamorphosis on aquatic escape performance. We hypothesize that shape changes associated with resorption of the larval tail fin at metamorphosis will affect aquatic locomotor performance. Escape responses were recorded using high-speed video, and the effects of life stage and total length on escape kinematics were analyzed statistically using analysis of covariance. Our results show that both larval and adult E. bislineata use a two-stage escape response (similar to the C-starts of fishes) that consists of a preparatory (stage 1) and a propulsive (stage 2) stroke. The duration of both kinematic stages and the distance traveled during stage 2 increased with total length. Both larval and adult E. bislineata had final escape trajectories that were directed away from the stimulus. The main kinematic difference between larvae and adults is that adults exhibit significantly greater maximum curvature during stage 1. Total escape duration and the distance traveled during stage 2 did not differ significantly between larvae and adults. Despite the significantly lower tail aspect ratio of adults, we found no significant decrease in the overall escape performance of adult E. bislineata. Our results suggest that adults may compensate for the decrease in tail aspect ratio by increasing their maximum curvature. These findings do not support the hypothesis that larvae exhibit better locomotor performance than adults as a result of stronger selective pressures on early life stages.\n      Movie available on-line: http://www.biologists.com/JEB/movies/jeb3978.html."},{"title":"Anoxia induces thermotolerance in the locust flight system","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/6/815","abstract":"\n        Heat shock and anoxia are environmental stresses that are known to trigger similar cellular responses. In this study, we used the locust to examine stress cross-tolerance by investigating the consequences of a prior anoxic stress on the effects of a subsequent high-temperature stress. Anoxic stress and heat shock induced thermotolerance by increasing the ability of intact locusts to survive normally lethal temperatures. To determine whether induced thermotolerance observed in the intact animal was correlated with electrophysiological changes, we measured whole-cell K+ currents and action potentials from locust neurons. K+ currents recorded from thoracic neuron somata were reduced after anoxic stress and decreased with increases in temperature. Prior anoxic stress and heat shock increased the upper temperature limit for generation of an action potential during a subsequent heat stress. Although anoxia induced thermotolerance in the locust flight system, a prior heat shock did not protect locusts from a subsequent anoxic stress. To determine whether changes in bioenergetic status were implicated in whole-animal cross-tolerance, phosphagen levels and rates of mitochondrial respiration were assayed. Heat shock alone had no effect on bioenergetic status. Prior heat shock allowed rapid recovery after normally lethal heat stress but afforded no protection after a subsequent anoxic stress. Heat shock also afforded no protection against disruption of bioenergetic status after a subsequent exercise stress. These metabolite studies are consistent with the electrophysiological data that demonstrate that a prior exposure to anoxia can have protective effects against high-temperature stress but that heat shock does not induce tolerance to anoxia.\n      "},{"title":"Dual antennular chemosensory pathways mediate odor-associative learning and odor discrimination in the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/6/851","abstract":"\n        Chemosensory neurons in the antennular flagella of lobsters mediate long-range responses to chemicals.

Aesthetasc sensilla on the lateral flagella are innervated by chemosensory neurons that project to the olfactory lobes. A diversity of other ‘non-aesthetasc’ sensilla on both lateral and medial flagella are innervated by mechano- and chemosensory neurons, and most of these non-aesthetasc neurons project to the lateral antennular neuropils. We investigated the roles of these two pathways in odor-associative learning and odor discrimination by selectively removing either aesthetasc or non-aesthetasc sensilla from the spiny lobster Panulirus argus. Lobsters lacking both aesthetasc and non-aesthetasc antennular sensilla show very reduced or no odor-mediated searching behavior. We associatively conditioned lobsters using two paradigms: aversive conditioning with generalization testing (which reveals the similarity in the lobsters’ perception of odorants) and discrimination conditioning (which reveals the lobsters’ ability to discriminate odorants). Sham-control intact lobsters performed these tasks well, as did lobsters lacking either aesthetascs or non-aesthetasc setae. There was a strong but statistically non-significant trend that lobsters lacking either aesthetascs or non-aesthetasc setae generalized more between complex odor mixtures than did intact lobsters. After aversive conditioning with generalization testing, aesthetasc-ablated lobsters had more difficulty discriminating among the most closely related complex mixtures than did intact or non-aesthetasc-ablated lobsters. However, after discrimination conditioning, aesthetasc-ablated lobsters were as proficient as intact animals in discriminating highly similar mixtures. These results indicate overlap and redundancy in the function of these two chemosensory pathways in odor-associative learning and odor discrimination, but these pathways also complement each other to enable better discrimination. This study presents the first evidence for a role of non-aesthetasc chemosensory neurons in complex odor-mediated behaviors such as learning and discrimination.\n      "},{"title":"The visual centring response in desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/5/585","abstract":"\n        When negotiating their way through cluttered environments, desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, tend to run along the midlines of the alleys formed by adjacent low shrubs.

The sidewalls of the channel were either homogeneously black or provided with stationary or moving black-and-white gratings. The speed of motion and the spatial period of the gratings and the height of the walls could be varied independently on the left-hand and right-hand sides of the channel. The results clearly show that the ants, while exhibiting their centring responses, try to balance neither the self-induced image speeds nor the contrast frequencies seen in their left and right visual fields, but the vertical angle subtended by the landmarks on either side. When manoeuvring through the channel, the ants always adjust the lateral positions of their walking trajectories in such a way that the vertical angles subtended by the walls are identical for both eyes.\n      "},{"title":"Cn11, the first example of a scorpion toxin that is a true blocker of Na+ currents in crayfish neurons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/6/869","abstract":"\n        A novel crustacean toxin (Cn11) was isolated and characterized from the venom of the Mexican scorpion Centruroides noxius Hoffmann.

In neurons isolated from the X organ–sinus gland system of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii, it blocks the Na+ currents with an estimated Km of 320 nmol l–1, without affecting the Ca2+ and K+ currents. The voltage-gated tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ current was recorded from X organ neurons in culture 24 h after plating using the whole-cell clamp configuration. The Na+ current was isolated by blocking Ca2+ currents with Cd2+ and Cs+ and K+ currents with tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine. Under control conditions, the Na+ currents were activated at –40 mV with a maximum amplitude at 0 mV. In the presence of 1 μmol l–1 Cn11, the Na+ current amplitude was reduced by 75 % without apparent modifications to the gating mechanism.

When a female returns from the ocean, she has to find her pup among several hundred others. Taking into account both spectral and temporal domains, we investigated the individual vocal signature occurring in the ‘female attraction call’ used by pups to attract their mother. We calculated the intra- and inter-individual variability for each measured acoustic cue to isolate those likely to contain information about individual identity. We then tested these cues in playback experiments. Our results show that a female pays particular attention to the lower part of the signal spectrum, the fundamental frequency accompanied by its first two harmonics being sufficient to elicit reliable recognition. The spectral energy distribution is also important for the recognition process. Of the temporal features, frequency modulation appears to be a key component for individual recognition, whereas amplitude modulation is not implicated in the identification of the pup’s voice by its mother. We discuss these results with respect to the constraints imposed on fur seals by a colonial way of life.\n      "},{"title":"Carbonic anhydrase in the midgut of larval Aedes aegypti: cloning, localization and inhibition","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/5/591","abstract":"\n        The larval mosquito midgut exhibits one of the highest pH values known in a biological system.

Alkalization is likely to involve bicarbonate/carbonate ions. These ions are produced in vivo by the enzymatic action of carbonic anhydrase. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of this enzyme in the alkalization mechanism, to establish its presence and localization in the midgut of larval Aedes aegypti and to clone and characterize its cDNA. Here, we report the physiological demonstration of the involvement of carbonic anhydrase in midgut alkalization. Histochemistry and in situ hybridization showed that the enzyme appears to be localized throughout the midgut, although preferentially in the gastric caeca and posterior regions with specific cellular heterogeneity. Furthermore, we report the cloning and localization of the first carbonic anhydrase from mosquito larval midgut. A cDNA clone from Aedes aegypti larval midgut revealed sequence homology to α-carbonic anhydrases from vertebrates. Bioinformatics indicates the presence of at least six carbonic anhydrases or closely related genes in the genome of another dipteran, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Molecular analyses suggest that the larval mosquito may also possess multiple forms.\n      "},{"title":"Kinematics and hydrodynamics of an invertebrate undulatory swimmer: the damsel-fly larva","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/5/627","abstract":"\n        The kinematics and hydrodynamics of free-swimming larvae of Enallagma cyathigerum were investigated using videography combined with a simple wake visualisation technique (tracer dyes). Damsel-fly larvae are undulatory swimmers with two distinct styles of movement: ‘slow’ swimming, in which body undulation is assisted by paddling of the legs, and ‘fast’ swimming, in which the legs are inactive. In both cases, the wake consists of discrete ring vortices shed from the caudal fin at the end of each half-stroke. The vortices propagate away from the mid-line, alternately to one side of the body then the other, at an angle of 67° from dead aft. There is no aft-flowing jet such as that observed in the wakes of continuously swimming fish that use caudal fin propulsion. The estimated momentum within the vortices, and the resultant thrust on the body are in tolerable agreement with calculations based on the large-amplitude bulk momentum model of fish locomotion. However, the drag on the body is not known, so it cannot be concluded with certainty that a force balance exists. The agreement between experiment and prediction gives confidence to the idea that most, if not all, of the vorticity generated by the swimming larva is located within the observable wake elements.\n      "},{"title":"Ticking of the clockwork cricket: the role of the escapement mechanism","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/5/613","abstract":"\n        The ‘clockwork cricket’ model for cricket sound production suggests that the catch-and-release of the file of one forewing by the plectrum on the opposite wing act as an ‘escapement’ to provide the phasic impulses that initiate and sustain the vibration of the resonant regions of the wings from which the sounds are produced. The action of the escapement produces the familiar ticking sound of clocks.\n      \n        The higher-frequency components of the songs of twelve species of cricket were analysed after removing the dominant low-frequency components and amplifying the remaining higher-frequency components.

In all of these, the anomalous pulse envelope was associated with changes in the amplitude and/or instantaneous frequency of the higher-frequency components of the sound.\n      \n        A model of the escapement suggests that the frequency of the residual components of the song depends on the symmetry of action of the plectrum on the teeth of the file.\n      "},{"title":"The use of ground-borne vibrations for prey localization in the Saharan sand vipers (Cerastes)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/5/661","abstract":"\n        Sand vipers of the genus Cerastes are specialized semi-fossorial snakes that launch predatory strikes at rodents and lizards while partially buried in the soft sand of the Saharan desert. This study attempted to document which environmental stimuli are used by these snakes as a trigger for the ambush behavior. Denervating the olfactory and vomeronasal organs produced no changes in prey capture behavior in Cerastes cerastes. Occluding the eyes of the denervated specimens resulted in significant decreases in strike distance, diversity of strike angle and strike accuracy, demonstrating the importance of visual stimuli for target acquisition in this species. Nevertheless, every olfactory-denervated, temporarily blinded specimen succeeded in capturing free-ranging mice in every trial. Presentation of chemosensory-neutral targets to the olfactory-denervated, temporarily blinded specimens resulted in similar predatory behaviors, whether the target was isothermic to the environment or heated to mammalian body temperature. Collectively, these results provide evidence for the importance of visual stimuli during foraging in C. cerastes, the first experimental evidence for foraging by vibration detection in snakes and the strongest evidence to date that snakes are capable of ‘hearing’ vibrational stimuli.\n      "},{"title":"Mechanical trade-offs explain how performance increases without increasing cost in rattlesnake tailshaker muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/5/667","abstract":"\n        Rattling by rattlesnakes is one of the fastest vertebrate movements and involves some of the highest contraction frequencies sustained by vertebrate muscle. Rattling requires higher accelerations at higher twitch frequencies, yet a previous study showed that the cost per twitch of rattling is independent of twitch frequency. We used force and video recordings over a range of temperatures to examine how western diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) achieve faster movements without increases in metabolic cost. The key findings are (i) that increasing muscle twitch tension trades off with decreasing twitch duration to keep the tension–time integral per twitch nearly constant over a wide range of temperatures and twitch frequencies and (ii) that decreasing lateral displacement of the rattle joint moderates the mechanical work and power required to shake the rattle at higher frequencies. These mechanical trade-offs between twitch tension and duration and between joint force and displacement explain how force, work and power increase without an increase in metabolic cost.\n      "},{"title":"Accumulation of ammonia in the body and NH3 volatilization from alkaline regions of the body surface during ammonia loading and exposure to air in the weather loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/5/651","abstract":"\n        The weather loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus inhabits rice fields that experience drought in summer and ammonia loading during agricultural fertilisation. Exposure of specimens to ammonia led to the accumulation of ammonia in muscle, liver and blood. The level of ammonia reached in the plasma was the highest reported among fishes. Ammonia was not detoxified to urea, and urea excretion rate was unaffected by ammonia exposure. Fish acidified the water to reduce ammonia loading. Ammonia loading, unlike aerial exposure, did not induce glutamine synthesis, and there was no accumulation of glutamine. This is a unique observation different from those reported for other fishes in the literature. An initial switch to partial amino acid catabolism led to the accumulation of alanine and was probably associated with a decreased rate of ammonia production. Aerial exposure led to decreases in rates of ammonia and urea excretion, as well as the accumulation of tissue ammonia. As the internal ammonia levels increased, M. anguillicaudatus was able to excrete some ammonia in the gaseous form (NH3). The percentage of ammonia excreted as NH3 increased with time of exposure and with increasing temperature. It appears that air-breathing through the gut is involved, with the anterior portion of the digestive tract playing a central role: it became significantly more alkaline in fish exposed to air or to environmental ammonia. The skin, which also became more alkaline during air exposure, may also be involved in ammonia volatilization in air-exposed fish. This represents the first report of a fish using volatilization of NH3 as part of a defence against ammonia toxicity. It can be concluded that the main strategy adopted by M. anguillicaudatus confronted with ammonia loading or air exposure is to tolerate high ammonia levels in the tissues. During periods of elevated tissue ammonia levels, some ammonia is lost by volatilization via air-breathing using the gut. In addition, some ammonia may be lost across the skin during air exposure.\n      "},{"title":"Interspecific- and acclimation-induced variation in levels of heat-shock proteins 70 (hsp70) and 90 (hsp90) and heat-shock transcription factor-1 (HSF1) in congeneric marine snails (genus Tegula): implications for regulation of hsp gene expression","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/5/677","abstract":"\n        In our previous studies of heat-shock protein (hsp) expression in congeneric marine gastropods of the genus Tegula, we observed interspecific and acclimation-induced variation in the temperatures at which heat-shock gene expression is induced (Ton). To investigate the factors responsible for these inter- and intraspecific differences in Ton, we tested the predictions of the ‘cellular thermometer’ model for the transcriptional regulation of hsp expression. According to this model, hsps not active in chaperoning unfolded proteins bind to a transcription factor, heat-shock factor-1 (HSF1), thereby reducing the levels of free HSF1 that are available to bind to the heat-shock element, a regulatory element upstream of hsp genes. Under stress, hsps bind to denatured proteins, releasing HSF1, which can now activate hsp gene transcription. Thus, elevated levels of heat-shock proteins of the 40, 70 and 90 kDa families (hsp 40, hsp70 and hsp90, respectively) would be predicted to elevate Ton. Conversely, elevated levels of HSF1 would be predicted to decrease Ton. Following laboratory acclimation to 13, 18 and 23°C, we used solid-phase immunochemistry (western analysis) to quantify endogenous levels of two hsp70 isoforms (hsp74 and hsp72), hsp90 and HSF1 in the low- to mid-intertidal species Tegula funebralis and in two subtidal to low-intertidal congeners, T. brunnea and T. montereyi. We found higher endogenous levels of hsp72 (a strongly heat-induced isoform) at 13 and 18°C in T. funebralis in comparison with T. brunnea and T. montereyi. However, T. funebralis also had higher levels of HSF1 than its congeners. The higher levels of HSF1 in T. funebralis cannot, within the framework of the cellular thermometer model, account for the higher Ton observed for this species, although they may explain why T. funebralis is able to induce the heat-shock response more rapidly than T. brunnea. However, the cellular thermometer model does appear to explain the cause of the increases in Ton that occurred during warm acclimation of the two subtidal species, in which warm acclimation was accompanied by increased levels of hsp72, hsp74 and hsp90, whereas levels of HSF1 remained stable. T. funebralis, which experiences greater heat stress than its subtidal congeners, consistently had higher ratios of hsp72 to hsp74 than its congeners, although the sum of levels of the two isoforms was similar for all three species except at the highest acclimation temperature (23°C). The ratio of hsp72 to hsp74 may provide a more accurate estimate of environmental heat stress than the total concentrations of both hsp70 isoforms.\n      "},{"title":"Evolutionary determinants of normal arterial plasma pH in ectothermic vertebrates","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/5/641","abstract":"\n        Mean values of normal arterial pH in different species of fish, amphibians and reptiles at 15 and 25°C, taken from the literature, are negatively correlated with arterial PCO2 and plasma [Na+]. At either temperature, the data accord with the hypothesis that extracellular acid–base homeostasis evolved to maintain an optimal pH at particular cell-surface sites that are similar in all species. These hypothetical sites bear fixed negative charges that attract H+, but which are partially screened by Na+; for the surface pH to be constant, the bulk interstitial pH should then vary inversely with [Na+], as is the case. At the same time, the bulk interstitial fluid must be more acid than arterial plasma by an amount that increases with decreasing arterial PCO2. With allowance made for additional screening by Ca2+ and Mg2+, the relevant cell-surface pH is probably approximately 6.2.\n      "},{"title":"How the efficiency of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) ventricular muscle changes with cycle frequency","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/5/697","abstract":"\n        Different species of animals require different cardiac performance and, in turn, their cardiac muscle exhibits different properties. A comparative approach can reveal a great deal about the mechanisms underlying myocardial contraction. Differences in myocardial Ca2+ handling between fish and mammals suggest a greater energy cost of activation in fish. Further, while there is considerable evidence that heart rate (or cycle frequency) should have a profound effect on the efficiency of teleost cardiac muscle, this effect has been largely overlooked. We set out to determine how cycle frequency affects the power output and efficiency of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) ventricular muscle and to relate this to the heart’s function in life. We measured power output and the rate of oxygen consumption (V̇O2) and then calculated efficiency over a physiologically realistic range of cycle frequencies.\n      \n        In contrast to mammalian cardiac muscle, in which V̇O2 increases with increasing heart rate, we found no significant change in V̇O2 in the teleost. However, power output increased by 25 % as cycle frequency was increased from 0.6 to 1.0 Hz, so net and total efficiency increased. A maximum total efficiency of 20 % was achieved at 0.8 Hz, whereas maximum power output occurred at 1.0 Hz. We propose that, since the heart operates continuously, high mechanical efficiency is a major adaptive advantage, particularly at lower heart rates corresponding to the more commonly used slower, sustainable swimming speeds. Efficiency was lower at the higher heart rates required during very fast swimming, which are used during escape or prey capture.\n      \n        If a fixed amount of Ca2+ is released and then resequestered each time the muscle is activated, the activation cost should increase with frequency. We had anticipated that this would have a large effect on the total energy cost of contraction. However, since V̇O2 remains constant, less oxygen is consumed per cycle at high frequencies. We suggest that a constant V̇O2 would be observed if the amount of activator Ca2+ were to decrease with frequency. This decrease in activation energy is consistent with the decrease in the systolic intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transient with increasing stimulation frequency seen in earlier studies.\n      "},{"title":"Protein loss during long-distance migratory flight in passerine birds: adaptation and constraint","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/5/687","abstract":"\n        During long-distance flights, birds catabolize not only fat but also protein. Because there is no storage form of protein, protein catabolism entails a structural or functional loss. In this study, we investigated which organs were most reduced in lean mass during different phases of fat store loss and whether protein loss can be regarded as adaptive or as a constraint. Body and organ composition were analysed both during the autumn migration over continental Europe (sample from Switzerland) and after a long-distance flight over the Sahara and the Mediterranean Sea in spring (sample from Ventotene, Italy) in four species of passerine bird: pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, garden warbler Sylvia borin and barn swallow Hirundo rustica. Large variations in protein mass occurred when long non-stop flights were performed. After a long-distance flight, birds showed a marked increase in net protein loss when fat stores were nearing depletion (analogous to the late phase of endurance fasting when the rate of protein catabolism is increased). When fat reserves were above approximately 5–10 %, protein was derived from all organs, but particularly from the breast muscles. When fat stores diminished further and protein catabolism increased, the mass of the digestive organs was reduced fastest. When the decrease in breast muscle mass during flight was regarded in terms of potential flight performance, it appeared that the use of breast muscle protein with decreasing body mass can be regarded as adaptive as long as fat stores did not reach a critical level. Below approximately 5–10 % body fat, however, protein loss reduced flight performance. This demonstrates that the phase of fasting (the size of the remaining fat stores) is an important condition for understanding the occurrence and effects of protein loss during endurance flights.\n      "},{"title":"Template-matching describes visual pattern-recognition tasks in the weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/4/549","abstract":"\n        Several insects use template-matching systems to recognize objects or environmental landmarks by comparing actual and stored retinal images. Such systems are not viewpoint-invariant and are useful only when the locations in which the images have been stored and where they are later retrieved coincide. Here, we describe that a vertebrate, the weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii, appears to use template-matching to recognize visual patterns that it had previously viewed from a fixed vantage point. This fish is nocturnal and uses its electrical sense to find its way in the dark, yet it has functional vision that appears to be well adapted to dim light conditions. We were able to train three fish in a two-alternative forced-choice procedure to discriminate a rewarded from an unrewarded visual pattern. From its daytime shelter, each fish viewed two visual patterns placed at a set distance behind a transparent Plexiglas screen that closed the shelter. When the screen was lifted, the fish swam towards one of the patterns to receive a food reward or to be directed back into its shelter. Successful pattern discrimination was limited to low ambient light intensities of approximately 10 lx and to pattern sizes subtending a visual angle greater than 3°. To analyze the characteristics used by the fish to discriminate the visual training patterns, we performed transfer tests in which the training patterns were replaced by other patterns. The results of all such transfer tests can best be explained by a template-matching mechanism in which the fish stores the view of the rewarded training pattern and chooses from two other patterns the one whose retinal appearance best matches the stored view.\n      "},{"title":"Hyperosmotic and thermal stresses activate p38-MAPK in the perfused amphibian heart","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/4/443","abstract":"\n        We assessed the activation of p38-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) by osmotic and thermal stresses in the isolated perfused amphibian (Rana ridibunda) heart. Hyperosmotic stress induced the rapid activation of the kinase. In particular, in the presence of 0.5 mol l–1 sorbitol, p38-MAPK was maximally phosphorylated (by approximately twelvefold) at 15 min, while excess of NaCl (206 mmol l–1 final concentration) or KCl (16 mmol l–1 final concentration) stimulated a less potent activation, maximised (by approximately eightfold and fourfold) within 2 min and 30 s, respectively, relative to control values. The effect of all three compounds examined was reversible, since the kinase phosphorylation levels decreased upon reperfusion of the heart with normal bicarbonate-buffered saline. Conversely, hypotonicity did not induce any p38-MAPK activation. Furthermore, both hypothermia and hyperthermia induced considerable phosphorylation of the kinase, by four- and 7.5-fold, respectively, relative to control values. Immunohistochemical studies elucidated the localisation pattern of phospho-p38-MAPK and also revealed enhanced atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) immunoreactivity in osmotically stressed hearts. Interestingly, SB 203580 (1 μmol l–1) not only completely blocked the activation of p38-MAPK by all these interventions, but also abolished the enhanced ANP immunoreactivity induced by 0.5 mol l–1 sorbitol.

In this study, egg deposition by a herbivorous insect was shown to induce a gymnosperm plant to emit volatiles that attract egg parasitoids. Odour from twigs of Pinus sylvestris laden with egg masses of the pine sawfly Diprion pini attracts the eulophid egg parasitoid Chrysonotomyia ruforum. Volatiles released from pine twigs without diprionid eggs are not attractive. Oviposition by the sawfly onto pine needles induces not only a local response in pine needles laden with eggs but also a systemic reaction. Needles without eggs but adjacent to those bearing diprionid eggs also release the volatiles that attract the egg parasitoid. The elicitor of the attractive volatiles was shown to be present in the oviduct secretion coating the eggs of D. pini. When pine twigs are treated with jasmonic acid, a well-known plant wound signal, they emit volatiles that attract the egg parasitoid. These results show, for the first time, that a gymnosperm plant is able to attract parasitoids as soon as a herbivore has deposited its eggs on it. Thus, the plant appears to defend itself against herbivores prior to being damaged by feeding larvae.\n      "},{"title":"Discrimination of closed shapes by two species of bee, Apis mellifera and Megachile rotundata","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/4/559","abstract":"\n        In the present study, the performance of two bee species, the honeybee Apis mellifera and the leaf-cutter bee Megachile rotundata, in discriminating among various closed (convex) shapes was examined systematically for the first time. Bees were trained to each of five different shapes, a disc, a square, a diamond and two different triangles, all of the same area, using fresh bees in each experiment. In subsequent tests, the trained bees were given a choice between the learned shape and each of the other four shapes. Two sets of experiments were conducted with both species. In the first, solid black shapes were presented against a white background, thus providing a high luminance contrast. In the second, the shapes carried a random black-and-white pattern and were presented 5 cm in front of a similar pattern, thus producing motion contrast, rather than luminance contrast, against the background.\n      \n        The results obtained with the solid shapes reveal that both bee species accomplish the discrimination, although the performance of the honeybee is significantly better than that of the leaf-cutter bee. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the various shapes differs between the two species. However, in neither species is the discrimination performance correlated with the amount of overlap of the black areas contained in the various pairs of shapes, suggesting that, in our experiments, shape discrimination is not based on a template-matching process. We propose that it is based on the use of local parameters situated at the outline of the shape, such as the position of angles or acute points and, in particular, the position and orientation of edges. This conclusion is supported by the finding that bees of both species accomplish the discrimination even with the patterned shapes. These shapes are visible only because of the discontinuity of the speed of image motion perceived at the edge between the shape and the background.\n      "},{"title":"Insect midgut K+ secretion: concerted run-down of apical/basolateral transporters with extra-/intracellular acidity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/4/463","abstract":"\n        In lepidopteran larvae, three transport mechanisms are involved in the active and electrogenic K+ secretion that occurs in the epithelial goblet cells of the midgut. These consist of (i) basolateral K+ channels, allowing K+ entry from the haemolymph into the cytosol, (ii) apical electrogenic K+/2H+ antiporters, which are responsible for secondary active extrusion of K+ from the cell into the gut lumen via the goblet cavity and (iii) apical V-ATPase-type proton pumps. The latter energize apical K+ exit by building up a large, cavity-positive electrical potential that drives the antiporters. Net K+ secretion (IK) can be measured as short-circuit current (Isc) across the in vitro midgut mounted in an Ussing chamber. We investigated the influence of protons on the transepithelial IK and the partial reactions of the basolateral K+ permeability (PK) and the apical, lumped ‘K+ pump’ current (IP) at various extra- and intracellular pH values. In particular, we wanted to know whether increased cellular acidity could counteract the reversible dissociation of the V-ATPase into its V1 and Vo parts, as occurs in yeast after glucose deprivation and in the midgut of Manduca sexta during starvation or moulting, thus possibly enhancing K+ transport.When intact epithelia were perfused with high-[K+] (32 mmol l–1) salines with different pH values, IK was reversibly reduced when pH values fell below 6 on either side of the epithelium. Attempts to modify the intracellular pH by pulsing with NH4+ or propionate showed that intracellular acidification caused a reduction in IK similar to that obtained in response to application of external protons. Treatment with azide, a well-known inhibitor of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, had the same effect as pulsing with ammonium or propionate with, however, much faster kinetics and higher reversibility. Breakdown of the basolateral or apical barrier using the antibiotic nystatin allowed the intracellular pH to be clamped to that of the saline facing the nystatin-treated epithelial border. Cell acidification achieved by this manipulation led to a reduction in both apical IP and basolateral PK. The transepithelial IK showed an approximately half-maximal reduction at external pH values close to 5 in intact tissues, and a similar reduction in IP and PK values was seen at an intracellular pH of 5 in nystatin-permeabilised epithelia. Thus, the hypothesized V1Vo stabilization by cell acidity is not reflected in the pH-sensitivity of IP. Moreover, all components that transport K+ are synchronously inhibited below pH 6. The significance of our findings for the midgut in vivo is discussed.\n      "},{"title":"Visual control of host pursuit in the parasitoid fly Exorista japonica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/4/485","abstract":"\n        The tachinid fly Exorista japonica is a parasitoid of many kinds of lepidopterous larvae.

Observation was performed in sunlight and under illumination from a fluorescent lamp. The fly pursued hosts discontinuously with a repeated stop-and-run motion. During a run, its movements consisted of rotation, forward translation and sideways translation. Rotation during a run was positively correlated with the angular position of the host’s head. The direction of translation depended on the angular position of the host’s head. Forward translation was negatively correlated with the visual angle subtended by the host. These results suggest that the fly orients and walks towards the leading edge of a moving target.

The two corticotropin-releasing-factor (CRF)-related diuretic peptides previously isolated from Tenebrio molitor, Tenmo-DH37 and Tenmo-DH47, were found to stimulate Tenebrio molitor tubules in vitro in a dose-dependent manner with EC50 values of 0.12 nmol l–1 and 26 nmol l–1 respectively. However, no synergistic or additive effect was observed when these two peptides were tested simultaneously. We then investigated antagonism between second messengers: dose–response curves were constructed for stimulation of Tenebrio molitor tubules by cyclic AMP and their inhibition by cyclic GMP. When both cyclic nucleotides were included in the bathing Ringer, the stimulatory effect of cyclic AMP was neutralised by cyclic GMP. Similarly, the stimulatory effect of Tenmo-DH37 was reversed on addition of an antidiuretic peptide (Tenmo-ADF), which was recently isolated from Tenebrio molitor and acts via cyclic GMP. The cardioacceleratory peptide CAP2b, originally isolated from Manduca sexta, also increases intracellular cyclic GMP levels and inhibited fluid secretion by Tenebrio molitor tubules, with an EC50 value of 85 nmol l–1. This inhibitory effect was reversed by Tenmo-DH37. Endogenous diuretic and antidiuretic peptides, effective at low concentrations and acting via antagonistic second messengers, have the potential for fine control of secretion rates in the Malpighian tubules of Tenebrio molitor.\n      "},{"title":"Heart rate and energy expenditure of incubating wandering albatrosses: basal levels, natural variation, and the effects of human disturbance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/4/475","abstract":"\n        We studied the changes in heart rate (HR) associated with metabolic rate of incubating and resting adult wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans) on the Crozet Islands.

Incubating albatrosses were then fitted with HR recorders to estimate energy expenditure of albatrosses within natural field conditions. We also examined the natural variation in HR and the effects of human disturbance on nesting birds by monitoring the changes in HR. Basal HR was positively related to the mass of the individual. The HR of incubating birds corresponded to a metabolic rate that was 1.5-fold (males) and 1.8-fold (females) lower than basal metabolic rate (BMR) measured in this and a previous study. The difference was probably attributable to birds being stressed while they were held in the metabolic chamber or wearing a mask. Thus, previous measurements of metabolic rate under basal conditions or for incubating wandering albatrosses are likely to be overestimates. Combining the relationship between HR and metabolic rate for both sexes, we estimate that wandering albatrosses expend 147 kJ kg–1 day–1 to incubate their eggs. In addition, the cost of incubation was assumed to vary because (i) HR was higher during the day than at night, and (ii) there was an effect of wind chill (<0°C) on basal HR. The presence of humans in the vicinity of the nest or after a band control was shown to increase HR for extended periods (2–3 h), suggesting that energy expenditure was increased as a result of the disturbance. Lastly, males and females reacted differently to handling in terms of HR response: males reacted more strongly than females before handling, whereas females took longer to recover after being handled.\n      "},{"title":"Physiological responses of Houbara bustards to high ambient temperatures","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/4/503","abstract":"\n        Desert birds often experience a scarcity of drinking water and food and must survive episodes of high ambient temperature (Ta).

Captive-reared Houbara bustards (mass 1245±242 g, N=7, mean ± s.d.) in summer have a resting metabolic rate (RMR) of 261.4 kJ day–1, 26 % below allometric predictions, and a total evaporative water loss (TEWL) at 25°C of 25.8 g day–1, 31 % below predictions. When Ta exceeded body temperature (Tb), the dry heat transfer coefficient decreased, a finding supporting the prediction that birds should minimize dry heat gain from the environment at high Ta values.

The amplitudes of the EPSPs in the distal fibres were intermediate between those of the proximal and central regions. These differences in EPSP amplitudes were correlated with differences in short-term facilitation between the three regions. When given a 10- or 20-pulse train of stimuli, the proximal fibres showed greater short-term facilitation initially, often followed by a maximization of short-term facilitation towards the end of a train. In contrast, the central fibres showed a linear increase in short-term facilitation throughout a stimulus train. The distal fibres showed intermediate short-term facilitation compared with the other two regions. Analysis of myofibrillar isoforms showed that levels of troponin-T1 (TnT1), a 55 kDa isoform expressed in slow-tonic (S2) fibres, were correlated with synaptic properties. Proximal fibres had the highest levels of TnT1, with lower levels in distal fibres; central fibres lacked TnT1, which is characteristic of slow-twitch (S1) fibres. In addition, differences in troponin-I isoforms correlated with TnT1 levels between the proximal, central and distal regions. The correlation between slow fibre phenotype and strength of innervation suggests a relationship between synaptic structure and expression of troponin isoforms.\n      "},{"title":"Mechanics of the respiratory system in the newborn tammar wallaby","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/4/533","abstract":"\n        We investigated whether the mechanical properties of the respiratory system represent a major constraint to spontaneous breathing in the newborn tammar wallaby Macropus eugenii, which is born after a very short gestation (approximately 28 days, birth mass approximately 380 mg). The rate of oxygen consumption (V̇O2) through the skin was approximately 33 % of the total V̇O2 at day 1 and approximately 14 % at day 6. The mass-specific resting minute ventilation (V̇e) and the ventilatory equivalent (V̇e/V̇O2) were approximately the same at the two ages, with a breathing pattern significantly deeper and slower at day 1. The mass-specific compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) did not differ significantly between the two age groups and was close to the values predicted from measurements in eutherian newborns. Mass-specific respiratory system resistance (Rrs) at day 1 was higher than at day 6, and also higher than in eutherian newborns. Chest distortion, quantified as the degree of abdominal motion during spontaneous breathing compared with that required to inflate the lungs passively, at day 1 was very large, whereas it was modest at day 6. We conclude that, in the tammar wallaby at birth, the high resistance of the respiratory system and the distortion of the chest wall greatly reduce the mechanical efficiency of breathing. At this age, gas exchange through the skin is therefore an important complement to pulmonary ventilation.\n      "},{"title":"Ion transport across posterior gills of hyperosmoregulating shore crabs (Carcinus maenas): amiloride blocks the cuticular Na+ conductance and induces current-noise","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/4/523","abstract":"\n        Split gill lamellae and gill cuticles of shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) adapted to 10 ‰ salinity were mounted in a modified Ussing-type chamber. With NaCl saline on both sides, split gill lamellae generated a short-circuit current (Isc) of –301±16 μA cm–2 at a conductance (Gte) of 40±2 mS cm–2. The net influxes of Na+ and Cl– were 8.3±2.6 and 18.2±2.7 μmol cm–2 h–1, respectively. External amiloride (100 μmol l–1) reduced Gte to approximately 50 % of the original value at unchanged Isc; Cl– fluxes remained unaffected, whereas Na+ fluxes were markedly reduced by 70–80 %. The Isc in the presence of external amiloride was almost completely inhibited by internal ouabain. At a clamp voltage of 50 mV (outside-positive), a positive current was measured at unchanged Gte. Under these conditions, amiloride reduced the current and conductance at half-maximal concentrations of 3.6 and 2.0 μmol l–1, respectively. At outside-positive voltages, but not under short-circuit conditions, external amiloride induced Lorentzian components in the power density spectra. The amiloride-dependent changes in the corner frequency (linear) and of the low-frequency plateau (‘bell-shaped’) were as expected for channel blockade by amiloride with pseudo-first-order kinetics. With an outside-positive clamp voltage of 50 mV across isolated cuticles, a positive cuticular current (Icut) of 25 188±3791 μA cm–2 and a cuticular conductance (Gcut) of 547±76 mS cm–2 were measured. External amiloride reduced Icut and Gcut at half-maximal concentrations of 0.7 and 0.6 μmol l–1, respectively. Amiloride-induced current-noise analysis gave similar results to those observed with split gill lamellae. Ion-substitution experiments with isolated cuticles further support inhibition by external amiloride of the cuticular Na+ conductance of shore crab gills and not amiloride-sensitive transporters (Na+ channels or Na+/H+ antiports) in the apical membrane.\n      "},{"title":"Shell clamping behaviour in the limpet Cellana tramoserica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/4/539","abstract":"\n        The behaviour of clamping the shell against the substratum may play an important role in the limpet adhesion mechanism because friction generated by this behaviour resists dislodgement by shear forces. This paper describes the development of an apparatus to analyse limpet clamping activity in relation to known forces, including simulated wave activity and predator attack. The results show that Cellana tramoserica clamps its shell in a closely regulated manner consistent with an active role in the limpet adhesion mechanism. Limpets clamped sharply for several seconds in response to single disturbances such as tapping the shell. In response to more continuous disturbance simulating a concerted predator attack, limpets clamped tightly for several minutes. In response to lifting forces applied to the shell, limpets clamped at a set proportion of the lifting force, even if the lift force was a highly dynamic wave profile. This behaviour has implications for numerical models that attempt to describe limpet adhesion because it shows that limpets cannot be represented by a simple mechanical analogue and that the clamping behaviour must be accounted for if useful predictions are to be drawn.\n      "},{"title":"Implanted electrode recordings from a praying mantis auditory interneuron during flying bat attacks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/3/307","abstract":"\n        Using an implanted electrode, we recorded the responses from the ultrasound-sensitive mantis interneuron 501-T3 during flying bat attacks in a large flight room where the mantis served as the target. 501-T3 responds to each vocalization emitted with multi-spike bursts when pulse repetition rates (PRRs) are below 55 pulses s–1. As PRR increases and pulse durations fall below 3 ms, 501-T3 ceases burst activity. On average, spike bursts cease 272 ms before contact (when the bat is 73 cm away from the preparation). The timing of cessation of activity in 501-T3 is similar to the latency for the diving portion of the response of the mantid (242 ms). Experiments using vocalizing stationary bats confirm that 501-T3 responds more reliably to longer pulse durations (⩾3 ms) when intensities are below 90 dB pe SPL. The cessation of 501-T3 activity is probably due both to the increasing PRR and to the decreasing pulse duration that occur in the terminal buzz phase of a bat attack. 501-T3 may be actively shut off at high PRRs and/or intensities to protect the interneuron from habituation while the mantis performs an escape response. The cessation of 501-T3 activity is consistent with the lack of a very late ultrasound-mediated evasive response by the mantis. However, cessation of 501-T3 activity may allow a true ‘last-chance’ response to be mediated by other neural systems.\n      "},{"title":"Evidence for increased myofibrillar mobility in desmin-null mouse skeletal muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/3/321","abstract":"\n        Quantitative electron microscopy was used to characterize the longitudinal mobility of myofibrils during muscle extension to investigate the functional roles of skeletal muscle intermediate filaments.

At short SL (<2.20 μm), wild-type and desmin-null Δxmyo were not significantly different, although there was a trend towards greater Z-disk misalignment in muscles from knockout animals (Δxmyo 0.34±0.04 μm versus 0.22±0.09 μm; P>0.2; means ± s.e.m.).

The results, which establish a maximum extension of the desmin network surrounding the Z-disk, provide what we believe to be the first quantitative estimation of the functional limits of the desmin intermediate filament system in the presence of an intact myofibrillar lattice. The existence of a limit on the extension of desmin suggests a mechanism for the recruitment of desmin into a network of force transmission, whether as a longitudinal load bearer or as a component in a radial force-transmission system.\n      "},{"title":"Tissue- and development-specific induction and turnover of hsp70\ntranscripts from loci 87A and 87C after heat shock and during recovery\nin Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/3/345","abstract":"\n        The haploid genome of Drosophila melanogaster normally carries at least five nearly identical copies of heat-shock-inducible hsp70 genes, two copies at the 87A7 and three copies at the 87C1 chromosome sites. We used in situ hybridization of the cDNA, which hybridizes with transcripts of all five hsp70 genes, and of two 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR; specific for the 87A7- and 87C1-type hsp70 transcripts) riboprobes to cellular RNA to examine whether all these copies were similarly induced by heat shock in different cell types of D. melanogaster. Our results revealed remarkable differences not only in the heat-shock-inducibility of the hsp70 genes at the 87A7 and 87C1 loci, but also in their post-transcriptional metabolism, such as the stability of the transcripts and of their 3′UTRs in different cell types in developing embryos and in larval and adult tissues. Our results also revealed the constitutive presence of the heat-shock-inducible form of Hsp70 in a subset of late spermatogonial cells from the second-instar larval stage onwards. We suggest that the multiple copies of the stress-inducible hsp70 genes do not exist in the genome of D. melanogaster only to produce large amounts of the Hsp70 rapidly and at short notice, but that they are specifically regulated in a developmental-stage-specific manner. It is likely that the cost/benefit ratio of not producing or of producing a defined amount of Hsp70 under stress conditions varies for different cell types and under different physiological conditions and, accordingly, specific regulatory mechanisms operating at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels have evolved.\n      "},{"title":"Determining patterns of motor recruitment during locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/3/359","abstract":"\n        Motor units are the functional units of muscle contraction in vertebrates. Each motor unit comprises muscle fibres of a particular fibre type and can be considered as fast or slow depending on its fibre-type composition. Motor units are typically recruited in a set order, from slow to fast, in response to the force requirements from the muscle. The anatomical separation of fast and slow muscle in fish permits direct recordings from these two fibre types. The frequency spectra from different slow and fast myotomal muscles were measured in the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. These two muscle fibre types generated distinct low and high myoelectric frequency bands. The cat paw-shake is an activity that recruits mainly fast muscle. This study showed that the myoelectric signal from the medial gastrocnemius of the cat was concentrated in a high frequency band during paw-shake behaviour. During slow walking, the slow motor units of the medial gastrocnemius are also recruited, and this appeared as increased muscle activity within a low frequency band. Therefore, high and low frequency bands could be distinguished in the myoelectric signals from the cat medial gastrocnemius and probably corresponded, respectively, to fast and slow motor unit recruitment. Myoelectric signals are resolved into time/frequency space using wavelets to demonstrate how patterns of motor unit recruitment can be determined for a range of locomotor activities.\n      "},{"title":"The influence of visual landscape on the free flight behavior of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/3/327","abstract":"\n        To study the visual cues that control steering behavior in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we reconstructed three-dimensional trajectories from images taken by stereo infrared video cameras during free flight within structured visual landscapes. Flies move through their environment using a series of straight flight segments separated by rapid turns, termed saccades, during which the fly alters course by approximately 90° in less than 100 ms. Altering the amount of background visual contrast caused significant changes in the fly’s translational velocity and saccade frequency. Between saccades, asymmetries in the estimates of optic flow induce gradual turns away from the side experiencing a greater motion stimulus, a behavior opposite to that predicted by a flight control model based upon optomotor equilibrium. To determine which features of visual motion trigger saccades, we reconstructed the visual environment from the fly’s perspective for each position in the flight trajectory. From these reconstructions, we modeled the fly’s estimation of optic flow on the basis of a two-dimensional array of Hassenstein–Reichardt elementary motion detectors and, through spatial summation, the large-field motion stimuli experienced by the fly during the course of its flight. Event-triggered averages of the large-field motion preceding each saccade suggest that image expansion is the signal that triggers each saccade. The asymmetry in output of the local motion detector array prior to each saccade influences the direction (left versus right) but not the magnitude of the rapid turn. Once initiated, visual feedback does not appear to influence saccade kinematics further. The total expansion experienced before a saccade was similar for flight within both uniform and visually textured backgrounds. In summary, our data suggest that complex behavioral patterns seen during free flight emerge from interactions between the flight control system and the visual environment.\n      "},{"title":"Kinematics of diving Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica L.):\nevidence for an active upstroke","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/3/371","abstract":"\n        To examine the propulsion mechanism of diving Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica), their three-dimensional kinematics was investigated by digital analysis of sequential video images of dorsal and lateral views. During the dives of this wing-propelled bird, the wings are partly folded, with the handwings directed backwards. The wings go through an oscillating motion in which the joint between the radius-ulna and the hand bones leads the motion, with the wing tip following. There is a large rotary motion of the wings during the stroke, with the wings being pronated at the beginning of the downstroke and supinated at the end of the downstroke/beginning of the upstroke. Calculated instantaneous velocities and accelerations of the bodies of the birds show that, during the downstroke, the birds accelerate upwards and forwards. During the upstroke, the birds accelerate downwards and, in some sequences analysed, also forwards, but in most cases the birds decelerate. In all the upstrokes analysed, the forward/backward acceleration shows the same pattern, with a reduced deceleration or even a forward acceleration during ‘mid’ upstroke indicating the production of a forward force, thrust. Our results show that the Atlantic puffin can use an active upstroke during diving, in contradiction to previous data. Furthermore, we suggest that the partly folded wings of diving puffins might act as efficient aft-swept wingtips, reducing the induced drag and increasing the lift-to-drag ratio.\n      A movie is available on-line."},{"title":"Differences in behaviour between rainbow trout selected for high- and low-stress responsiveness","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/3/391","abstract":"\n        Two F1 lines of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, divergent for plasma cortisol responsiveness, were generated by individual selection for post-stress cortisol values within the F0 generation. Adult females of the F1 generation were transferred to rearing in social isolation in observation tanks. After 6 days, locomotor activity in high-responding (HR) and low-responding (LR) individuals was quantified as time spent moving during a 20 min observation period. Behavioural observations were repeated the next day with a smaller conspecific intruder present in each observation tank. Differential hypothalamus–pituitary–interrenal axis activity in the two lines was subsequently confirmed by a standardised confinement stress test, which resulted in significantly higher plasma cortisol concentrations in HR than LR fish. HR fish displayed higher levels of locomotor activity than LR fish in the presence of an intruder, but not when in isolation. Aggressive behaviour towards the intruder was not seen, suggesting either a state-dependent lack of territorial aggression, or chronic stress in the experimental fish. A significantly higher incidence of feed intake was seen in LR trout when held in observation tanks (40 % versus 0 % of the fish took food when in isolation), suggesting that these fish acclimated more successfully to the experimental conditions than HR fish did. These results suggest that selection for stress responsiveness in salmonid fish leads to behavioural alterations, which are of potential importance to the performance of these fish in aquaculture rearing operations.\n      "},{"title":"A motor and a brake: two leg extensor muscles acting at the same joint manage energy differently in a running insect","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/3/379","abstract":"\n        The individual muscles of a multiple muscle group at a given joint are often assumed to function synergistically to share the load during locomotion. We examined two leg extensors of a running cockroach to test the hypothesis that leg muscles within an anatomical muscle group necessarily manage (i.e. produce, store, transmit or absorb) energy similarly during running. Using electromyographic and video motion-analysis techniques, we determined that muscles 177c and 179 are both active during the first half of the stance period during muscle shortening. Using the in vivo strain and stimulation patterns determined during running, we measured muscle power output. Although both muscles were stimulated during the first half of shortening, muscle 177c generated mechanical energy (28 W kg–1) like a motor, while muscle 179 absorbed energy (–19 W kg–1) like a brake. Both muscles exhibited nearly identical intrinsic characteristics including similar twitch kinetics and force–velocity relationships. Differences in the extrinsic factors of activation and relative shortening velocity caused the muscles to operate very differently during running. Presumed redundancy in a multiple muscle group may, therefore, represent diversity in muscle function. Discovering how muscles manage energy during behavior requires the measurement of a large number of dynamically interacting variables.\n      "},{"title":"Modulation of swimming in the gastropod Melibe leonina by nitric oxide","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/3/397","abstract":"\n        Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous intercellular messenger produced by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. It has been implicated as a neuromodulator in several groups of animals, including gastropods, crustaceans and mammals. In this study, we investigated the effects of NO on the swim motor program produced by isolated brains and by semi-intact preparations of the nudibranch Melibe leonina. The NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 1 mmol l–1) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, 1 mmol l–1) both had a marked effect on the swim motor program expressed in isolated brains, causing an increase in the period of the swim cycle and a more erratic swim rhythm. In semi-intact preparations, the effect of NO donors was manifested as a significant decrease in the rate of actual swimming. An NO scavenger, reduced oxyhemoglobin, eliminated the effects of NO donors on isolated brains, supporting the assumption that the changes in swimming induced by donors were actually due to NO. The cGMP analogue 8-bromoguanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (1 mmol l–1) produced effects that mimicked those of NO donors, suggesting that NO is working via a cGMP-dependent mechanism. These results, in combination with previous histological studies indicating the endogenous presence of nitric oxide synthase, suggest that NO is used in the central nervous system of Melibe leonina to modulate swimming.\n      "},{"title":"Copper transport by lobster (Homarus americanus) hepatopancreatic mitochondria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/3/405","abstract":"\n        Mechanisms of copper transport into purified mitochondrial suspensions prepared from the hepatopancreas of the Atlantic lobster Homarus americanus were investigated.

Copper transport by this mitochondrial preparation was kinetically the sum of saturable and non-saturable transfer components. Addition of 500 μmol l–1 Ca2+ or 500 nmol l–1 Ruthenium Red abolished the non-saturable copper transport component, significantly (P<0.01) reduced the apparent binding affinity of the saturable transport component, but was without effect (P>0.05) on the apparent maximal transport velocity of the saturable transfer process. The antiport inhibitor diltiazem (500 μmol l–1) acted as a mixed inhibitor of the saturable transport mechanism, but had no effect on the non-saturable component of transfer. These results suggest that the non-saturable copper influx process was probably by way of the well-known Ruthenium-Red-sensitive Ca2+ uniporter and that the saturable transport component was probably due to a combination of both the Na+-dependent, diltiazem-sensitive 1Ca2+/2Na+ antiporter and the Na+-independent, diltiazem-insensitive 1Ca2+/2H+ antiporter.

However, cnidarian medusae span several taxonomic classes (collectively known as the Medusazoa) and represent a diverse array of morphologies and swimming styles. Does one mode of propulsion appropriately describe swimming by all medusae? This study examined a group of co-occurring hydromedusae collected from the waters of Friday Harbor, WA, USA, to investigate relationships between swimming performance and underlying mechanisms of thrust production. The six species examined encompassed a wide range of bell morphologies and swimming habits. Swimming performance (measured as swimming acceleration and velocity) varied widely among the species and was positively correlated with bell streamlining (measured as bell fineness ratio) and velar structure development (measured as velar aperture ratio). Calculated thrust production due to jet propulsion adequately explained acceleration patterns of prolate medusae (Aglantha digitale, Sarsia sp. and Proboscidactyla flavicirrata) possessing well-developed velums. However, acceleration patterns of oblate medusae (Aequorea victoria, Mitrocoma cellularia and Phialidium gregarium) that have less developed velums were poorly described by jet thrust production. An examination of the wakes behind swimming medusae indicated that, in contrast to the clearly defined jet structures produced by prolate species, oblate medusae did not produce defined jets but instead produced prominent vortices at the bell margins. These vortices are consistent with a predominantly drag-based, rowing mode of propulsion by the oblate species. These patterns of propulsive mechanics and swimming performance relate to the role played by swimming in the foraging ecology of each medusa. These patterns appear to extend beyond hydromedusae and thus have important implications for other members of the Medusazoa.\n      "},{"title":"The pulmonary surfactant system matures upon pipping in the freshwater turtle Chelydra serpentina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/3/415","abstract":"\n        Pulmonary surfactant (PS), a mixture of phospholipids (PL), neutral lipids and surfactant proteins (SP), lowers surface tension within the lung, which increases lung compliance and improves the removal of fluid at birth. Here, we have examined the expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and the surfactant protein SP-B, and also the composition of pulmonary surfactant lipids in the developing lung of the turtle Chelydra serpentina. Lavage and lung tissue were collected from late embryonic, pipped and hatchling turtles. TTF-1, a regulator of gene expression of surfactant proteins and cell differentiation in mammals, was detected using immunohistochemistry in epithelia of the gas-exchange area and conducting airways during late development. Expression declined in hatchlings. SP-B was detected in subsets of cells within the respiratory epithelium at all stages sampled. The same cell types also stained for TTF-1. Turtle surfactant lipids matured toward the end of incubation. Maximal secretion of both total phospholipids and disaturated phospholipid (DSP) occurred at the time of pipping, coincident with the onset of breathing. The DSP/PL ratio increased after pipping, whereas cholesterol levels (Chol) increased prior to pipping. This resulted in a decrease in the Chol/PL and Chol/DSP ratios after pipping. Thus, TTF-1 and SP-B appear to be highly conserved within the vertebrates.

Isolated gills, bathed and perfused with NaCl saline, spontaneously generate a negative transbranchial potential difference (Vte), which stabilises at positive or negative values. Ouabain shifts Vte to more positive values. When mounted in an Ussing chamber, distal split lamellae generate a negative, Cl–-dependent short-circuit current (Isc). Na+ substitution leads to more negative values of Isc. Internal ouabain is without effect, while diphenylamine-2-carboxylate and acetazolamide abolish Isc. Proximal split lamellae show a positive, Na+-dependent Isc, which decreases after internal application of ouabain.

Bath-application of 10–4 mol l–1 OA to the semi-intact preparation induced phasic muscle contractions, which are consistent with crawling. In the isolated VNC, OA induced bursts of motor neuron activity in the first lateral nerves. Burst frequency increased with OA concentration, with a large increase in activity observed in the range 10–6–10–4 mol l–1. At 10–4 mol l–1, the coefficient of variation of burst periods (BPs) was smaller than that seen upon application of OA at other concentrations, which is indicative of rhythmic bursts. These rhythmic bursts propagated along the VNC from the anterior to posterior, with a propagation velocity ranging from 60 to 110 mm s–1. This velocity is consistent with the propagation velocity of muscle contraction during crawling behavior in the intact earthworm. From these results, we conclude that fictive crawling motor patterns are observed at 10–4 mol l–1 OA, and that OA can induce rhythmic bursts in the isolated VNC of the earthworm.\n      "},{"title":"Whole-body hyperthermia-induced thermotolerance is associated with the induction of Heat Shock Protein 70 in mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/2/273","abstract":"\n        Molecular mechanisms of whole-body thermotolerance (WBT) in mammals have not been investigated thoroughly.

To study the molecular mechanism of WBT, we successfully developed a mouse model and suggest that, rather than the activities of antioxidant enzymes, it is HSP70i that has a role to help animals survive during severe heat stress.\n      "},{"title":"The archaeogastropod mollusc Haliotis iris: tissue and blood metabolites and allosteric regulation of haemocyanin function","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/2/253","abstract":"\n        We investigated divalent cation and anaerobic end-product concentrations and the interactive effects of these substances and pH on haemocyanin oxygen-binding (Hc-O2) in the New Zealand abalone Haliotis iris. During 24 h of environmental hypoxia (emersion), d-lactate and tauropine accumulated in the foot and shell adductor muscles and in the haemolymph of the aorta, the pedal sinus and adductor muscle lacunae, whereas l-lactate was not detected. Intramuscular and haemolymph d-lactate concentrations were similar, but tauropine accumulated to much higher levels in muscle tissues. Repeated disturbance and short-term exposure to air over 3 h induced no accumulation of d- or l-lactate and no change in [Ca2+], [Mg2+], pH and O2-binding properties of the native haemolymph.\n      \n        The haemolymph showed a low Hc-O2 affinity, a large reverse Bohr effect and marked cooperativity. Dialysis increased Hc-O2 affinity, obliterated cooperativity and decreased the pH-sensitivity of O2 binding. Replacing Mg2+ and Ca2+ restored the native O2-binding properties and the reverse Bohr shift. l- and d-lactate exerted minor modulatory effects on O2-affinity. At in vivo concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+, the cooperativity is dependent largely on Mg2+, which modulates the O2 association equilibrium constants of both the high-affinity (KR) and the low-affinity (KT) states (increasing and decreasing, respectively). This allosteric mechanism contrasts with that encountered in other haemocyanins and haemoglobins. The functional properties of H. iris haemocyanin suggest that high rates of O2 delivery to the tissues are not a priority but are consistent with the provision of a large O2 reserve for facultatively anaerobic tissues during internal hypoxia associated with clamping to the substratum.\n      "},{"title":"Copper metabolism in actively growing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss): interactions between dietary and waterborne copper uptake","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/2/279","abstract":"\n        Juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were exposed to diets with low (12.6 nmol g–1), normal (50.4 nmol g–1) or elevated (4437.5 nmol g–1) Cu concentrations in combination with either low (5.8 nmol l–1) or normal (48.5 nmol l–1) waterborne Cu levels over a 50-day period, during which body mass increased up to fivefold. A nutritional requirement for Cu was demonstrated based on growth response and whole body and tissue Cu status. Simultaneous low Cu levels in both the water and the diet depressed growth by 31 % over 7 weeks. There were reductions in both specific growth rate (SGR, 1.95 versus 2.55 % day–1) and food conversion efficiency (FCE, 53–59 % versus 75–80 %) over weeks 0–4, but these effects disappeared in weeks 4–7. Elevated concentrations of dietary Cu did not affect SGR or FCE. Low levels of dietary and waterborne Cu decreased, and high levels of dietary Cu increased, the Cu concentrations in whole body, liver, carcass, gut and gills. Copper levels in the liver strongly reflected the exposure conditions with a corresponding fivefold decrease and a 22-fold increase in Cu concentration. Restricting available Cu caused an exponential decline in whole body Cu concentration from 0.0175 to 0.0069 μmol g–1 and increased the uptake of waterborne Cu (measured with 64Cu) by the gills. Conversely, high levels of dietary Cu caused a linear increase in whole body Cu concentration to approximately 0.170 μmol g–1 and depressed the uptake of waterborne Cu. Waterborne Cu uptake contributed the majority (60 %) of the body’s Cu accumulation under Cu-deficient conditions while dietary Cu contributed the majority (99 %) at high dietary levels of Cu. True bioavailability of dietary Cu decreased with increasing levels of dietary Cu concentration, although the absolute amount retained increased. These findings demonstrate an important interaction between dietary and waterborne Cu uptake in fish and provide compelling evidence of a key role for the gill in Cu homeostasis.\n      "},{"title":"Vascular control in larval Xenopus laevis: the role of endothelial-derived factors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/2/225","abstract":"\n        We used novel digital contrasting methods to measure the effects of endothelin-1 (ET-1, 10–6 to 10–8 mol l–1), the nitric-oxide-releasing agent sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 10–2 mol l–1) and Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME, 10–4 mol l–1), a non-selective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, on the diameter of tiny arteries and veins of the head in anaesthetized Xenopus laevis tadpoles (stage NF 50–53). Perfusion of the main artery and vein supplying the head with ET-1 caused an immediate, significant and dose-dependent vasoconstriction. While preincubation with l-NAME caused no significant change in vessel diameter, the constriction provoked by subsequent endothelin administration was significantly enhanced. Application of SNP caused a vasodilation that was significant only after preconstriction with ET-1 (10–6 mol l–1). Our results provide strong evidence that the vasculature of developing Xenopus laevis tadpoles (NF stage 50–53) is influenced by endogenously released nitric oxide and endothelin.

Such changes may affect maximal exercise performance. This repeated-measures, randomized study, conducted at 3600 m, tests the hypothesis that a P-mediated increase in V̇e increases maximal oxygen consumption (V̇O2max) during the L phase relative to the F phase in Bolivian women, either born and raised at high altitude (HA), or resident at HA since early childhood. Subjects (N=30) enrolled in the study were aged 27.7±0.7 years (mean ± s.e.m.) and non-pregnant, non-lactating, relatively sedentary residents of La Paz, Bolivia, who were not using hormonal contraceptives. Mean salivary P levels at the time of the exercise tests were 63.3 pg ml–1 and 22.9 pg ml–1 for the L and F phases, respectively. Subset analyses of submaximal (N=23) and maximal (N=13) exercise responses were conducted only with women showing increased P levels from F to L and, in the latter case, with those also achieving true V̇O2max. Submaximal exercise V̇e and ventilatory equivalents were higher in the L phase (P<0.001). P levels were significantly correlated to the submaximal exercise V̇e (r=0.487, P=0.006). Maximal work output (W) was higher (approximately 5 %) during the L phase (P=0.044), but V̇O2max (l min–1) was unchanged (P=0.063). Post-hoc analyses revealed no significant relationship between changes in P levels and changes in V̇O2max from F to L (P=0.072). In sum, the menstrual cycle phase has relatively modest effects on ventilation, but no effect on V̇O2max of HA native women.\n      "},{"title":"Light-induced and circadian changes in the compound eye of the haematophagous bug Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera: Reduviidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/2/201","abstract":"\n        We analysed dynamic changes in the ommatidial structure of the compound eyes of Triatoma infestans. This nocturnal insect possesses open-rhabdom eyes, in which a ring of six rhabdomeres from retinula cells 1–6 (R1–6) surrounds a central pair of rhabdomeres from retinula cells 7 and 8 (R7–8). Screening pigments are located in all the photoreceptors and in the primary (PPC) and secondary (SPC) pigment cells. During the day, pigments within R1–6 and the PPCs form a small ‘pupil’ above the rhabdom and pigments within R7–8 are clustered around the central rhabdomere, allowing light to reach only the central rhabdomere. At night, the ‘pupil’ widens, and pigments inside R7–8 concentrate in the proximal region of the cells, allowing light to reach the peripheral rhabdomeres. In addition, the distance between the cornea and the rhabdom decreases. These rhythmic changes adapt the sensitivity of the eye by controlling the amount of light reaching and travelling within the rhabdom. Furthermore, the rhythm persists under conditions of constant darkness (DD), i.e. it is controlled by an endogenous oscillator. Remarkably, there are differences in pigment movements between the retinula cells of a single ommatidium. The migration of pigments in R1–6 is regulated by a circadian input, while that in R7–8 is regulated by both direct light and circadian inputs. The rhythm vanishes under constant-light conditions (LL). In this species, the circadian rhythm of photonegative behaviour persists in both DD and LL conditions, suggesting that these two rhythms, in retinal morphology and visual behaviour, may be generated by different circadian oscillators.\n      "},{"title":"The effect of stimulus features on the visual orienting behaviour of the salamander Plethodon jordani","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/2/241","abstract":"\n        The effects of the visual features of prey-like objects on the orienting behaviour of the salamander Plethodon jordani were studied.

They differed in size, contrast, velocity and movement pattern of the entire body or the body appendages. Size and velocity appeared to be the dominant features; shape was of lesser importance. Contrast and movement pattern were of intermediate importance and local motion of little importance. This rank order was the same when the probability of a response to the different stimuli was estimated by means of the maximum-likelihood method. Cluster analysis revealed that in all animals stimuli could be grouped into five clusters. Among individuals, the rank order of stimuli was similar for high- and low-ranking stimuli and varied for those of intermediate rank; stimuli could be grouped into 3–5 clusters.

Contraction of the dorsal muscles, m. syringealis dorsalis (dS) and m. tracheobronchialis dorsalis, constricts the syringeal lumen and thus reduces airflow by adducting connective tissue masses, the medial (ML) and lateral (LL) labia. Activity of the medial portion of the dS appears to affect the position of the ML and, consequently, plays a previously undescribed role in aperture control. Under the experimental conditions used in this study, full constriction of the syringeal lumen could not be achieved by stimulating adductor muscles. Full closure may require simultaneous activation of extrinsic syringeal muscles or the supine positioning of the bird may have exerted excessive tension on the syrinx. Contraction of m. tracheobronchialis ventralis enlarges the syringeal lumen and thus increases airflow by abducting the LL but does not affect the ML. The largest syringeal muscle, m. syringealis ventralis, plays a minor role, if any, in direct aperture control and thus in gating airflow.\n      \n        In parrots (cockatiels, Nymphicus hollandicus), direct observations show that even during quiet respiration the lateral tympaniform membranes (LTMs) are partially adducted into the tracheal lumen to form a narrow slot. Contraction of the superficial intrinsic muscle, m. syringealis superficialis, adducts the LTMs further into the tracheal lumen but does not close the syringeal aperture fully. The intrinsic deep muscle, m. syringealis profundus, abducts the LTMs through cranio-laterad movement of a paired, protruding half-ring. The weakly developed extrinsic m. sternotrachealis seems to increase tension in the ipsilateral LTM but does not move it in or out of the syringeal lumen.\n      "},{"title":"Three-dimensional morphometry of spinal cord injury following polyethylene glycol treatment","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/1/13","abstract":"\n        We are developing a novel means of restoring function after severe acute spinal cord injury.

In the present paper, we used three-dimensional computer reconstructions of PEG-treated and sham-treated spinal cords to determine whether the pathological character of a 1-month-old injury is ameliorated by application of PEG. Using a novel isocontouring algorithm, we show that immediate PEG treatment and treatment delayed by up to 7 h post-injury statistically increased the volume of intact spinal parenchyma and reduced the amount of cystic cavitation. Furthermore, in PEG-treated animals, the lesion was more focal and less diffuse throughout the damaged segment of the spinal cord, so that control cords showed a significantly extended lesion surface area. This three-dimensional computer evaluation showed that the functional recovery produced by topical application of a hydrophilic polymer is accompanied by a reduction in spinal cord damage.\n      "},{"title":"Effects of longitudinal body position and swimming speed on mechanical power of deep red muscle from skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/2/189","abstract":"\n        The mechanical power output of deep, red muscle from skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) was studied to investigate (i) whether this muscle generates maximum power during cruise swimming, (ii) how the differences in strain experienced by red muscle at different axial body locations affect its performance and (iii) how swimming speed affects muscle work and power output. Red muscle was isolated from approximately mid-way through the deep wedge that lies next to the backbone; anterior (0.44 fork lengths, ANT) and posterior (0.70 fork lengths, POST) samples were studied. Work and power were measured at 25°C using the work loop technique. Stimulus phases and durations and muscle strains (±5.5 % in ANT and ±8 % in POST locations) experienced during cruise swimming at different speeds were obtained from previous studies and used during work loop recordings. In addition, stimulus conditions that maximized work were determined. The stimulus durations and phases yielding maximum work decreased with increasing cycle frequency (analogous to tail-beat frequency), were the same at both axial locations and were almost identical to those used by the fish during swimming, indicating that the muscle produces near-maximal work under most conditions in swimming fish. While muscle in the posterior region undergoes larger strain and thus produces more mass-specific power than muscle in the anterior region, when the longitudinal distribution of red muscle mass is considered, the anterior muscles appear to contribute approximately 40 % more total power. Mechanical work per length cycle was maximal at a cycle frequency of 2–3 Hz, dropping to near zero at 15 Hz and by 20–50 % at 1 Hz. Mechanical power was maximal at a cycle frequency of 5 Hz, dropping to near zero at 15 Hz. These fish typically cruise with tail-beat frequencies of 2.8–5.2 Hz, frequencies at which power from cyclic contractions of deep red muscles was 75–100 % maximal. At any given frequency over this range, power using stimulation conditions recorded from swimming fish averaged 93.4±1.65 % at ANT locations and 88.6±2.08 % at POST locations (means ± s.e.m., N=3–6) of the maximum using optimized conditions. When cycle frequency was held constant (4 Hz) and strain amplitude was increased, work and power increased similarly in muscles from both sample sites; work and power increased 2.5-fold when strain was elevated from ±2 to ±5.5 %, but increased by only approximately 12 % when strain was raised further from ±5.5 to ±8 %. Taken together, these data suggest that red muscle fibres along the entire body are used in a similar fashion to produce near-maximal mechanical power for propulsion during normal cruise swimming. Modelling suggests that the tail-beat frequency at which power is maximal (5 Hz) is very close to that used at the predicted maximum aerobic swimming speed (5.8 Hz) in these fish.\n      "},{"title":"Circadian rhythm of acidification in insect vas deferens regulated by rhythmic expression of vacuolar H+-ATPase","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/1/37","abstract":"\n        Recent studies have demonstrated that the peripheral tissues of vertebrates and invertebrates contain circadian clocks; however, little is known about their functions and the rhythmic outputs that they generate. To understand clock-controlled rhythms at the cellular level, we investigated a circadian clock located in the reproductive system of a male moth (the cotton leaf worm Spodoptera littoralis) that is essential for the production of fertile spermatozoa. Previous work has demonstrated that spermatozoa are released from the testes in a daily rhythm and are periodically stored in the upper vas deferens (UVD). In this paper, we demonstrate a circadian rhythm in pH in the lumen of the UVD, with acidification occurring during accumulation of spermatozoa in the lumen. The daily rhythm in pH correlates with a rhythmic increase in the expression of a proton pump, the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), in the apical portion of the UVD epithelium. Rhythms in pH and V-ATPase persist in light/dark cycles and constant darkness, but are abolished in constant light, a condition that disrupts clock function and renders spermatozoa infertile. Treatment with colchicine impairs the migration of V-ATPase-positive vesicles to the apical cell membrane and abates the acidification of the UVD lumen. Bafilomycin, a selective inhibitor of V-ATPase activity, also prevents the decline in luminal pH. We conclude that the circadian clock generates a rhythm of luminal acidification by regulating the levels and subcellular distribution of V-ATPase in the UVD epithelium. Our data provide the first evidence for circadian control of V-ATPase, the fundamental enzyme that provides the driving force for numerous secondary transport processes. They also demonstrate how circadian rhythms displayed by individual cells contribute to the synchrony of physiological processes at the organ level.\n      "},{"title":"In vivo oocyte hydration in Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus); proteolytic liberation of free amino acids, and ion transport, are driving forces for osmotic water influx","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/2/211","abstract":"\n        The in vivo swelling and hydration of maturing oocytes of Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus were studied in order to characterise the osmotic mechanism underlying oocyte hydration in oviparous marine teleosts that spawn pelagic eggs. Sequential biopsies from two females, spanning four hydration cycles, were examined by osmometry, solute analysis and electrophoresis of dissected hydrating oocytes and ovulated eggs. The hydration cycle of the biopsied halibuts lasted 33–54 h. The majority of ovarian oocytes existed in a pre-hydrated condition (individual wet mass approx. 3.7 mg, diameter approx. 1.87 mm, 63 % H2O) with easily visible, non-coalesced, yolk platelets. Group-synchronous batches of the pre-hydrated oocytes increased in individual wet mass, diameter and water content to reach the ovulated egg stage of approximately 15 mg, 3.0 mm and 90 % H2O, respectively. The yolk osmolality of the hydrating oocytes was transiently hyperosmotic to the ovarian fluid (range 305–350 mOsmol l–1) with a peak osmolality of about 450 mOsmol l–1 in oocytes of 6–8 mg individual wet mass. The transient hyperosmolality was well accounted for by the increase in oocyte content of free amino acids (FAAs; approx. 2300 nmol oocyte–1), K+ (approx. 750 nmol oocyte–1), Cl– (approx. 900 nmol oocyte–1), total ammonium (approx. 300 nmol oocyte–1) and inorganic phosphate (Pi; approx. 200 nmol oocyte–1) when relating to the increase in cellular water. The oocyte content of Na+ did not increase during the hydration phase. Extensive proteolysis of yolk proteins, in particular a 110 kDa protein, correlated with the increase in the FAA pool, although the latter increased by approx. 20 % more than could be accounted for by the decrease in the oocyte protein content. Both indispensable and dispensable amino acids increased in the FAA pool, and particularly serine, alanine, leucine, lysine, glutamine and glutamate. Taurine content remained stable at approx. 70 nmol oocyte–1 during oocyte hydration. The results show that final hydration of Atlantic halibut oocytes is caused by an osmotic water uptake in which FAAs, derived mainly from the hydrolysis of a 110 kDa yolk protein, contribute approximately 50 % of the yolk osmolality and ions (Cl–, K+, Pi, NH4+) make up the balance.\n      "},{"title":"Behavioral recovery from spinal cord injury following delayed application of polyethylene glycol","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/1/1","abstract":"\n        Topical application of the hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) to isolated adult guinea pig spinal cord injuries has been shown to lead to the recovery of both the anatomical integrity of the tissue and the conduction of nerve impulses through the lesion. Furthermore, a brief (2 min) application of the fusogen (Mr 1800, 50 % w/v aqueous solution) to the exposed spinal cord injury in vivo can also cause rapid recovery of nerve impulse conduction through the lesion in association with functional recovery. Behavioral recovery was demonstrated using a long-tract, spinal-cord-dependent behavior in rodents known as the cutaneus trunci muscle (CTM) reflex. This reflex is observed as a contraction of the skin of the back in response to tactile stimulation. Here, we confirm and extend these preliminary observations. A severe compression/contusion injury to the exposed thoracic spinal cord of the guinea pig was performed between thoracic vertebrae 10 and 11. Approximately 7 h later, a topical application of PEG was made to the injury (dura removed) for 2 min in 15 experimental animals, and levels of recovery were compared with those of 13 vehicle-treated control animals. In PEG-treated animals, 93 % recovered variable levels of CTM functioning and all recovered some level of conduction through the lesion, as measured by evoked potential techniques. The recovered reflex was relatively normal compared with the quantitative characteristics of the reflex prior to injury with respect to the direction, distance and velocity of skin contraction. Only 23 % of the control population showed any spontaneous CTM recovery (P=0.0003) and none recovered conduction through the lesion during the 1 month period of observation (P=0.0001).

In air-exposed fish, both ammonia (JAmm) and urea (JUrea) excretion continued at approximately 57 % and 39 %, respectively, of submerged rates. Remarkably, approximately 42 % of the total ammonia excreted during air-exposure was through NH3 volatilization. Ammonia did not accumulate in whole-body tissues of air-exposed fish, but levels of both urea and some FAAs (primarily alanine and glutamine) were up to twofold higher after 10 days. The activities of the ornithine–urea cycle enzymes carbamoyl phosphate synthetase III and ornithine transcarbamylase increased (by approximately 30 % and 36 %, respectively) in whole-body tissues of air-exposed fish, while levels of arginase remained unchanged. The activities of enzymes involved in amino acid and oxidative metabolism were not significantly different between control and air-exposed fish. Partitioning of the anterior and posterior ends of immersed fish revealed that just over half (57 %) of the total nitrogen (ammonia+urea) was excreted through the anterior end of the fish, presumably via the branchial tissues, while emersed fish increased excretion via the posterior end (kidney+skin). R. marmoratus do not undergo a shift towards ureotelism during air-exposure. Rather, we propose that R. marmoratus are able to survive on land for extended periods without significant ammonia accumulation because they continuously release ammonia, partially by NH3 volatilization.\n      "},{"title":"Passerines versus nonpasserines: so far, no statistical differences in the scaling of avian energetics","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/1/101","abstract":"\n        We analyzed and compared the scaling of both basal and maximal thermogenic metabolic rates in passerine and nonpasserine birds using conventional and phylogenetic methods.

The influence of environmental salinity and external ammonia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/1/79","abstract":"\n        At a field site in Belize, mangrove killifish Rivulus marmoratus inhabit hypersaline waters (up to 48 ‰) containing approximately 1 mmol l–1 ammonia. We tested the hypotheses that R. marmoratus modify their nitrogen metabolism and excretion (i) by accumulating free amino acids (FAAs) and urea in the tissues during hyperosmotic stress and (ii) by shifting to ureotelism and accumulating FAAs during hyperammonia stress. Urea excretion (JUrea) (but not ammonia excretion, JAmm) displayed a diurnal pattern, with significantly less (75 %) urea excreted at night than during the day in both laboratory-reared clones and wild-caught killifish. When fish were exposed to hypersaline conditions (45 ‰ sea water), JUrea was significantly reduced and tissue urea and FAA levels were elevated compared with those of control fish (15 ‰ sea water). When R. marmoratus were exposed to 0, 1, 2, 5 and 10 mmol l–1 NH4Cl (pH 8) for 48 h, no differences were found in JUrea. Remarkably, prolonged exposure (10 days) to 5 mmol l–1 NH4Cl (pH 8) did not result in an elevation of tissue ammonia levels. In addition, tissue urea and total FAA levels did not differ between control and ammonia-exposed fish after ⩾4 days. We propose that the euryhaline R. marmoratus retain urea and FAAs within their tissues in response to extreme osmotic stress. In contrast to many ammonia-tolerant fishes, R. marmoratus do not shift to ureotelism during prolonged hyperammonia stress, nor do they convert nitrogenous wastes into FAAs. The data suggest that killifish continue to eliminate ammonia despite an unfavourable blood-to-water gradient, thereby avoiding accumulation of ammonia.\n      "},{"title":"Gone but not forgotten: the lingering effects of intermediate-term memory on the persistence of long-term memory","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/1/131","abstract":"\n        Aerial respiratory behaviour can be operantly conditioned in Lymnaea stagnalis and, depending on the interval between the training sessions, memories of significantly different durations are produced. In naïve snails, a 15 min training procedure with a 30 min interval between three training sessions results in memory that persists for only 3 h (intermediate-term memory, ITM); whilst if the three 15 min training sessions are separated by a 1 h interval memory persists for 48 h (long-term memory, LTM). We found that if ITM training preceded LTM training, then LTM would persist for 24 h longer. This augmenting effect on LTM persistence could be demonstrated for up to 5 h following the last ITM training session, even though ITM was not observed at that time. However, if LTM training ensued 8 h after the last ITM training session, an augmented LTM did not occur. Extinguishing the memory produced by the ITM training procedure also prevented augmentation of LTM. That is, if an extinction procedure was given to the snails after the ITM training procedure, LTM did not persist longer than 48 h. Thus, at the behavioural level, ITM and LTM are interconnected.\n      "},{"title":"Effects of weather on daily body mass regulation in wintering dunlin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/1/109","abstract":"\n        We investigated the influence of changes in weather associated with winter storms on mass balance, activity and food consumption in captive dunlin (Calidris alpina) held in outdoor aviaries, and compared the aviary results with weather-related body mass differences in free-living dunlin collected at Bolinas Lagoon, California. Captive birds fed ad libitum increased their body mass at higher wind speeds and lower temperatures, suggesting regulation of energy stores, whereas free-living birds exhibited patterns suggesting thermoregulatory limits on body mass regulation. Daily energy expenditure in aviary dunlin was 2.85 kJ g d–1, or 2.8× basal metabolic rate (BMR), with thermostatic costs averaging 59 % of daily expenditure. Slight but significant increases in body mass and energy expenditure in captive birds on rainy days, adjusted for possible external water mass, suggested rainfall as a proximate cue in regulating daily body mass. Body mass changes under artificial rainfall indicated similar results, and field masses suggested that free-living birds have greater body mass on days with measurable rainfall. Increased activity costs under artificial rainfall were associated with an increase in maintenance activities, relative to controls. Whether activity costs increased on days with natural rates of rainfall was unclear. Our results are consistent with current hypotheses regarding the role of body mass regulation in providing insurance against increased starvation risk during deteriorating thermal or foraging conditions, or in reducing the costs of extra mass as conditions improve.\n      "},{"title":"In vivo characterisation of intestinal zinc uptake in freshwater rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/1/141","abstract":"\n        Knowledge of the uptake mechanisms and metabolism of metals is essential for understanding the factors governing metal toxicity, discerning means by which acclimation and homeostasis may be achieved and characterising interactions between the metal of interest and other environmental moieties. Zinc is both an important aquatic contaminant and a vital micronutrient. The physiological characterisation of dietary zinc absorption in fish has, therefore, important implications for environmental protection and aquaculture. The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of intestinal zinc uptake in freshwater rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), using an in vivo cannulation technique. Only a saturable component of zinc uptake, with a concentration giving half-maximal rate of accumulation (K0.5) of 309 μmol l–1, and a maximal rate of accumulation (Jmax) of 933 nmol kg–1 h–1, was described. This characterised the intestine as a low-affinity, high-capacity zinc absorption pathway. Physiological mechanisms appear to regulate zinc uptake. Intestinal mucus was one important regulatory locus, promoting zinc uptake at low concentrations yet buffering the animal against high luminal zinc loads. Regulatory mechanisms also seemed to limit subepithelial zinc accumulation. Experiments using ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) to wash the intestinal lumen following zinc perfusion exhibited a higher proportion of loosely associated zinc at higher perfused concentrations. This was attributed to saturation of the uptake process or efflux from the subepithelium. Two distinct pathways for passage of zinc across the epithelium were discerned, with post-intestinal transfer possibly mediated by sulphydryl groups, as illustrated by N-ethylmaleimide perfusion experiments. Putative roles of zinc transporters and/or intracellular-binding proteins are discussed.\n      "},{"title":"Egocentric information helps desert ants to navigate around familiar obstacles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4177","abstract":"\n        Homing ants have been shown to associate directional information with familiar landmarks. The sight of these local cues might either directly guide the path of the ant or it might activate a landmark-based vector that points towards the goal position. In either case, the ants define their courses within allocentric systems of reference. Here, we show that desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, forced to run along a devious path can use egocentric information as well. The ants were trained to deviate from their straight homebound course by a wide inconspicuous barrier that was placed between the feeding and nesting sites. At a distant test area, the ants were confronted with an identical barrier rotated through 45°. After passing the edge of the obstacle, the ants did not proceed in the trained direction, defined by the skylight compass, but rotated their courses to match the rotation of the barrier. Visual guidance could be excluded because, as soon as the ants turned around the end of the barrier, the visual cue it provided vanished from their field of view. Instead, the ants must have maintained a constant angle relative to their previous walking trajectory along the obstacle and, hence, must have determined their new vector course in an egocentric way.\n      "},{"title":"Amino acid modulation of in vivo intestinal zinc absorption in freshwater rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/1/151","abstract":"\n        The composition of the intestinal lumen is likely to have considerable influence upon the absorption, and consequently the nutrition and/or toxicity, of ingested zinc in aquatic environments, where zinc is both a nutrient and a toxicant of importance. The effects of amino acids upon intestinal zinc uptake in freshwater rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were studied using an in vivo perfusion technique. The presence of histidine, cysteine and taurine had distinct modifying actions upon quantitative and qualitative zinc absorption, compared to perfusion of zinc alone. Alterations in zinc transport were not correlated with changes in levels of free zinc ion. The chemical nature of the zinc–amino acid chelate, rather than the chelation itself, appeared to have the most important influence upon zinc absorption. l-histidine, despite a strong zinc-chelating effect, maintained quantitative zinc uptake at control (zinc alone) levels. This effect correlated with the formation of Zn(His)2 species. d-histidine at a luminal concentration of 100 mmol l–1 significantly enhanced subepithelial zinc accumulation, but reduced the fraction of zinc that was retained and absorbed by the fish. The possibility of a Zn(His)2-mediated pathway for intestinal uptake is discussed. l-cysteine specifically stimulated the accumulation of zinc post-intestinally, an effect attributed to enhanced zinc accumulation in the blood. Taurine increased subepithelial zinc accumulation, but decreased the passage of zinc to post-intestinal compartments. Amino acids are proposed to have important roles in modifying intestinal zinc uptake with potential implications for environmental toxicity as well as aquaculture.\n      "},{"title":"A comparison of nutritional regulation in solitarious- and gregarious-phase nymphs of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/1/121","abstract":"\n        Nutritional regulatory responses were compared for the cryptic ‘solitarious’ and the conspicuously coloured, aggregating ‘gregarious’ phases of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria. The desert locust has the genetic potential to exist in either phase, changing between them within a lifetime and epigenetically across generations. Our aim was to compare final-instar nymphs of the two phases with respect to key nutritional variables, including (i) points of regulated intake (the ‘intake target’) for protein and carbohydrate, (ii) the nature of trade-offs between over-eating nutrients in excess and under-eating those in deficit when fed nutritionally unbalanced foods, (iii) diet-related patterns of nutrient utilisation, and (iv) the performance consequences of eating nutritionally unbalanced diets. When provided with pairs of nutritionally unbalanced but complementary foods, both phases regulated their intake of protein and carbohydrate to a similar point. However, when confined to foods that were of unbalanced protein to carbohydrate ratio, gregarious nymphs ate more than solitarious insects. Both phases regulated protein growth, but gregarious insects did so to a lower adult body protein content and converted ingested protein to growth less efficiently. When fed a food high in carbohydrate and low in protein, gregarious nymphs deposited more body lipid and survived less well than did solitarious insects. Solitarious nymphs developed more quickly than gregarious nymphs except on the two most extremely unbalanced diets, on which development time was similar. The results are discussed with respect to the different nutritional ecologies of the two phases and used to develop the hypothesis that animals have evolved to trade-off the cost of eating excess of a nutritionally unbalanced diet against the probability of encountering foods of complementary composition in the future.\n      "},{"title":"Patch-clamp analysis of voltage-activated and chemically activated currents in the vomeronasal organ of Sternotherus odoratus (stinkpot/musk turtle)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4199","abstract":"\n        The electrophysiological basis of chemical communication in the specialized olfactory division of the vomeronasal (VN) organ is poorly understood. In total, 198 patch-clamp recordings were made from 42 animals (Sternotherus odoratus, the stinkpot/musk turtle) to study the electrically and chemically activated properties of VN neurons. The introduction of tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated dextran into the VN orifice permitted good visualization of the vomeronasal neural epithelium prior to dissociating it into single neurons. Basic electrical properties of the neurons were measured (resting potential, –54.5±2.7 mV, N=11; input resistance, 6.7±1.4 GΩ, N=25; capacitance, 4.2±0.3 pF, N=22; means ± s.e.m.). The voltage-gated K+ current inactivation rate was significantly slower in VN neurons from males than in those from females, and K+ currents in males were less sensitive (greater Ki) to tetraethylammonium. Vomeronasal neurons were held at a holding potential of –60 mV and tested for their response to five natural chemicals, female urine, male urine, female musk, male musk and catfish extract. Of the 90 VN neurons tested, 33 (34 %) responded to at least one of the five compounds. The peak amplitude of chemically evoked currents ranged from 4 to 180 pA, with two-thirds of responses less than 25 pA. Urine-evoked currents were of either polarity, whereas musk and catfish extract always elicited only inward currents. Urine applied to neurons harvested from female animals evoked currents that were 2–3 times larger than those elicited from male neurons. Musk-evoked inward currents were three times the magnitude of urine- or catfish-extract-evoked inward currents. The calculated breadth of responsiveness for neurons presented with this array of five chemicals indicated that the mean response spectrum of the VN neurons is narrow (H metric 0.11). This patch-clamp study indicates that VN neurons exhibit sexual dimorphism in function and specificity in response to complex natural chemicals.\n      "},{"title":"The correlation between wing kinematics and steering muscle activity in the blowfly Calliphora vicina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4213","abstract":"\n        Determining how the motor patterns of the nervous system are converted into the mechanical and behavioral output of the body is a central goal in the study of locomotion. In the case of dipteran flight, a population of small steering muscles controls many of the subtle changes in wing kinematics that allow flies to maneuver rapidly. We filmed the wing motion of tethered Calliphora vicina at high speed and simultaneously recorded multi-channel electromyographic signals from some of the prominent steering muscles in order to correlate kinematics with muscle activity. Using this analysis, we found that the timing of each spike in the basalare muscles was strongly correlated with changes in the deviation of the stroke plane during the downstroke. The relationship was non-linear such that the magnitude of the kinematic response to each muscle spike decreased with increasing levels of stroke deviation. This result suggests that downstroke deviation is controlled in part via the mechanical summation of basalare activity. We also found that interactions among the basalares and muscles III2–III4 determine the maximum forward amplitude of the wingstroke. In addition, activity in muscle I1 appears to participate in a wingbeat gearing mechanism, as previously proposed. Using these results, we have been able to correlate changes in wing kinematics with alteration in the spike rate, firing phase and combinatorial activity of identified steering muscles.\n      "},{"title":"Variations in respiratory muscle activity during echolocation when stationary in three species of bat (Microchiroptera: Vespertilionidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4185","abstract":"\n        Echolocating bats use respiratory muscles to power the production of biosonar vocalisations. The physical characteristics of these calls vary among species of bat, and variations also exist in the timing and patterns of respiratory muscle recruitment during echolocation. We recorded electromyograms from the respiratory muscles of three species of bat (Family Vespertilionidae) while the animals vocalised from stationary positions. Activity was recorded consistently from the lateral abdominal muscles (internal abdominal oblique and transversus abdominis) from all calling bats, but we found much variation within and among species. Bats in the family Vespertilionidae devoted longer periods of expiratory muscle activity to each call than did the mormoopid bat Pteronotus parnellii. These differences correlate negatively with the duration of calls. We suggest that morphological adaptations in some bats may facilitate the economic production of echolocation calls at rest.\n      "},{"title":"Identification of myosin light chains in Rana pipiens skeletal muscle and their expression patterns along single fibres","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4237","abstract":"\n        Isoforms of myosin heavy chain (MHC) and myosin light chain (MLC) influence contractile kinetics of skeletal muscle. We previously showed that the four major skeletal muscle fibre types in Rana pipiens (type 1, type 2, type 3 and tonic; amphibian nomenclature) contain four unique MHC isoforms. In the present study we defined the MLCs expressed in each of these R. pipiens fibre types. The MLC composition of single MHC-typed fibres was determined from western blots using a panel of monoclonal MLC antibodies. A total of seven MLCs were identified, including four types of MLC1, two of MLC2 and a single MLC3. Twitch fibre types (types 1, 2 and 3) expressed MLC1f and MLC2f, while tonic fibres contained a unique set of isoforms, MLC1Ta, MLC1Tb and MLC2T. MLC3 was expressed primarily in type 1, type 1-2 and type 2 fibres. Surprisingly, some frogs displayed a striking pattern of MLC expression where a unique isoform of MLC1 (MLC1x) was coexpressed along with the normal MLC1 isoform(s) in all fibre types. MLC1x was either expressed in all fibres of a given frog or was completely absent. The intraspecific polymorphism in MLC1 expression is likely to have a genetic basis, but is unlikely to be caused by allelic variation. The ratio of MLC3/MLC1 increased in direct proportion to the percentage of type 1 MHC, but was only weakly correlated. The variability in MLC3/MLC1 within a fibre type was extremely large. Both the MHC isoform and MLC3/MLC1 ratio varied significantly between 1 mm segments along the length of fibres. For all segments combined, MLC3/MLC1 increased with the percentage of type 1 MHC, but the correlation between segments was weaker than between fibres.\n      "},{"title":"Geographic variation in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance in the frog Limnodynastes peronii","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4227","abstract":"\n        I compared the thermal sensitivity of jumping performance of five populations of the striped marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) over a wide geographic range extending from the cool-temperate south to the tropical north of Australia. Maximum jumping performance of adult L. peronii was assessed for each population at eight temperatures between 5°C and 32°C using a custom-designed force platform. From force recordings for each individual jump, maximum jumping force (Fmax) and acceleration (Amax) and maximum power output (Pmax), take-off velocity (Umax), jump distance (DJ) and contact time on the platform (TC) were calculated. The body mass of adult L. peronii varied over their geographic range, from approximately 5 g for the lowland tropical population to more than 22 g for the cool-temperate populations. The thermal sensitivity of jumping performance varied over their geographic range, with the populations from the cooler climates generally performing better than those from the warmer climate populations at the cooler temperatures, and vice versa at the higher temperatures. However, not all parameters of jumping performance underwent parallel changes in thermal sensitivity amongst the populations of L. peronii. Only minor differences in the shape of the thermal sensitivity curves for Fmax and Amax were detected amongst the populations, while the thermal sensitivities of Umax, DJ and Pmax all displayed considerable variation amongst the populations. The optimal temperatures for Umax, DJ and Pmax were generally lower in the cool-temperate populations than in the tropical populations of L. peronii. To determine whether this geographic variation was due to genetic variation, or merely reflected phenotypic plasticity, I also compared the thermal sensitivity of jumping performance between metamorph L. peronii from two different populations raised under identical conditions in the laboratory. The maximum jumping distance of the metamorph L. peronii was assessed at seven temperatures between 8°C and 35°C for the two latitudinally extreme populations (i.e. lowland tropical Proserpine and cool-temperate Gippsland populations). Like adult L. peronii, the metamorphs from the cool-temperate population jumped further than those from the lowland tropical population at the lower temperatures, although no differences were detected at the higher temperatures. Thus, geographic variation in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance in L. peronii probably has a genetic component, and the different populations appear to have undergone genetic adaptation of their thermal sensitivity to the varied thermal environments.\n      "},{"title":"Longitudinal variation in muscle protein expression and contraction kinetics of largemouth bass axial muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4249","abstract":"\n        The present study investigates muscle protein expression in largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides through intra- and intermyomeric comparisons of white muscle.

Low percentage (4.75 %) polyacrylamide-SDS gels and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptide mapping revealed no obvious intramyomeric differences between the myosin heavy chains of the arm and cone regions. Electrophoresis of myofibrils and muscle homogenates on higher percentage gels also failed to demonstrate any significant differences between arm and cone regions in either the myosin light chains or any of the major insoluble and soluble contractile proteins. Two differences were discovered intermyomerically: (i) the ratio of two troponin T isoforms changed from head to tail and (ii) caudal muscle had a lower total parvalbumin content than rostral muscle. Since troponin T and parvalbumin have been implicated in the regulation of skeletal muscle kinetics, longitudinal variation in muscle contraction kinetics was predicted. Subsequent experiments revealed that bass rostral white muscle showed faster rates of activation and relaxation than more caudal muscle, as has been observed in white muscle of other fish species. Rostral–caudal variations in white muscle protein composition and contractile properties are predicted to affect patterns of power production during fast, unsteady swimming.\n      "},{"title":"Selective ablation of antennular sensilla on the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus suggests that dual antennular chemosensory pathways mediate odorant activation of searching and localization of food","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4259","abstract":"\n        In spiny lobsters and other decapod crustaceans, odorant-mediated searching behavior patterns are driven primarily by chemosensory neurons in the antennules. Two groups of antennular chemosensory neurons can be distinguished on the basis of the sensilla that they innervate and their central projections: those that innervate the aesthetasc sensilla on the lateral flagella and project into the glomerularly organized olfactory lobes, and those that innervate other (i.e. non-aesthetasc) sensilla on both lateral and medial flagella and project into the stratified and non-glomerularly organized lateral antennular neuropils. By ablating different groups of antennular sensory neurons or sensilla, we examined the role of aesthetasc and non-aesthetasc chemosensory neurons in regulating local searching behavior of Caribbean spiny lobsters, Panulirus argus, for food (squid) in a low-flow environment. The results show that odorant-mediated activation of searching and localization of food under these conditions requires only a subset of functional antennular chemosensory neurons, since neither aesthetasc chemosensory neurons nor non-aesthetasc chemosensory neurons are by themselves necessary for these types of behavior. However, ablation of aesthetasc chemosensory neurons together with subsets of non-aesthetasc chemosensory neurons from either the medial or lateral flagella impairs the ability of lobsters to locate the food. This reveals a large degree of functional redundancy but also some complementary functions between aesthetasc and non-aesthetasc chemosensory neurons, and hence between these dual antennular chemosensory pathways, in odorant-mediated searching behavior of lobsters under these conditions.\n      "},{"title":"Molecular activity of Na+/K+-ATPase from different sources is related to the packing of membrane lipids","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4271","abstract":"\n        The activity of the ubiquitous Na+/K+-ATPase represents a substantial portion of the resting metabolic activity of cells, and the molecular activity of this enzyme from tissues of different vertebrates can vary several-fold.

Disproving the hypothesis, we find, using chronic, implanted preparations, that a good omitted stimulus potential is reliably present. The system learns in a few cycles of a regularly repeated light flash to expect one on schedule. Omitted stimulus potentials are found in the protocerebrum, the circumesophageal connective and in the optic tract – perhaps arising in the retina, as in vertebrates. These potentials can be very local and can include loci with and without direct visual evoked potentials in response to each flash. In some loci, the omitted stimulus potential has a slow wave component, in others only a spike burst. Omitted stimulus potentials are more endogenous than visual evoked potentials, with little dependence on flash or ambient light intensity or on train duration. They vary little in size at different times of the day, but abruptly fail to appear if the ambient light is cut off. They can occur during walking, eating or the maintained defense posture but are diminished by ‘distraction’ and are often absent from an inert crayfish until it is aroused.\n      \n        We consider this form of apparent expectation of a learned rhythm (a property that makes it ‘cognitive’ in current usage), to be one of low level, even though some properties suggest endogenous factors. The flashes in a train have an inhibitory effect on a circuit that quickly ‘learns’ the stimulus interval so that the omitted stimulus potential, ready to happen after the learned interval, is prevented by each flash, until released by a missing stimulus.\n      "},{"title":"Juvenile sturgeon exhibit reduced physiological responses to exercise","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4281","abstract":"\n        Experiments were conducted to determine the physiological responses to exercise of Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrhynchus) and shortnose sturgeon (A. brevirostrum).

We hypothesized that increased intermittency has evolved in lines of house mice (Mus domesticus) that have been selectively bred for high voluntary wheel-running (wheel diameter 1.12 m) activity. After 23 generations, female mice from four replicate selection lines ran 2.7 times more revolutions per day than individuals from four random-bred control lines. To measure instantaneous running speeds and to quantify intermittency, we videotaped mice (N=41) during a 5-min period of peak activity on night 6 of a 6-day exposure to wheels. Compared with controls (20 revs min–1 while actually running), selection-line females (41 revs min–1) ran significantly faster. These instantaneous speeds closely matched the computer-recorded speeds over the same 5-min period. Selection-line females also ran more intermittently, with shorter (10.0 s bout–1) and more frequent (7.8 bouts min–1) bouts than controls (16.8 s bout–1, 3.4 bouts min–1). Inter-bout pauses were also significantly shorter in selection-line (2.7 s) than in control-line (7.4 s) females. We hypothesize that intermittency of locomotion is a key feature allowing the increased wheel-running performance at high running speeds in selection-line mice.\n      "},{"title":"Venom flow in rattlesnakes: mechanics and metering","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4345","abstract":"\n        The functional morphology of venom injection in Crotalus atrox was explored using high-speed digital videography combined with direct recording of venom flow using perivascular flow probes. Although venom flow was variable, in most strikes the onset of venom flow was coincidental with fang penetration, and retrograde flow (venom suction) was observed prior to fang withdrawal. The duration of venom flow was consistently less than the duration of fang penetration. The occurrence of retrograde flow, ‘dry bites’ (which accounted for 35 % of the strikes) and unilateral strikes all support a hypothesis for venom pooling in the distal portion of the venom-delivery system. No significant difference in temporal or volumetric aspects of venom flow were found between defensive strikes directed at small and large rodents. With the species and size of target held constant, the duration of venom flow, maximum venom flow rate and total venom volume were all significantly lower in predatory than in defensive strikes.\n      "},{"title":"Complete suppression of protein synthesis during anoxia with no post-anoxia protein synthesis debt in the red-eared slider turtle Trachemys scripta elegans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4353","abstract":"\n        Two previous studies of the effects of anoxia on protein synthesis in anoxia-tolerant turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans, Chrysemys picta bellii) have generated opposing results. Using the flooding-dose method, we measured the rate of protein synthesis following injection and incorporation of a large dose of radiolabelled phenylalanine to resolve the question of whether anoxia results in a downregulation of protein synthesis. After 1 h of anoxia, levels of protein-incorporated radiolabel indicated that protein synthesis rates in the intestine, heart, liver, brain, muscle and lungs were not significantly different from those of normoxic controls. However, from 1 to 6 h of anoxia, quantities of protein-incorporated radiolabel did not increase, suggesting that protein synthesis had ceased or had decreased below a measurable level. There was also no significant post-anoxia increase in protein synthesis rates above normoxic control levels during 3 h of recovery from anoxia. RNA-to-protein ratios did not change significantly in any tissue except the heart, in which RNA levels decreased below normoxic control levels after 6 h of anoxia. Except in the heart, downregulation of protein synthesis during anoxia does not appear to be mediated by changes in tissue RNA concentration.\n      "},{"title":"Control of heart rate during thermoregulation in the heliothermic lizard Pogona barbata: importance of cholinergic and adrenergic mechanisms","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4361","abstract":"\n        During thermoregulation in the bearded dragon Pogona barbata, heart rate when heating is significantly faster than when cooling at any given body temperature (heart rate hysteresis), resulting in faster rates of heating than cooling. However, the mechanisms that control heart rate during heating and cooling are unknown. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that changes in cholinergic and adrenergic tone on the heart are responsible for the heart rate hysteresis during heating and cooling in P. barbata. Heating and cooling trials were conducted before and after the administration of atropine, a muscarinic antagonist, and sotalol, a β-adrenergic antagonist. Cholinergic and β-adrenergic blockade did not abolish the heart rate hysteresis, as the heart rate during heating was significantly faster than during cooling in all cases. Adrenergic tone was extremely high (92.3 %) at the commencement of heating, and decreased to 30.7 % at the end of the cooling period. Moreover, in four lizards there was an instantaneous drop in heart rate (up to 15 beats min–1) as the heat source was switched off, and this drop in heart rate coincided with either a drop in β-adrenergic tone or an increase in cholinergic tone. Rates of heating were significantly faster during the cholinergic blockade, and least with a combined cholinergic and β-adrenergic blockade. The results showed that cholinergic and β-adrenergic systems are not the only control mechanisms acting on the heart during heating and cooling, but they do have a significant effect on heart rate and on rates of heating and cooling.\n      "},{"title":"Bimodal breathing in jumping spiders: morphometric partitioning of the lungs and tracheae in Salticus scenicus (Arachnida, Araneae, Salticidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4321","abstract":"\n        In jumping spiders, both the book lungs and the tracheal system are well-developed. The tracheal system consists of four thick primary tracheae that branch into small secondary tracheae, some of them ending in the opisthosoma and others entering the prosoma. We used stereological morphometric methods to investigate the morphological diffusing capacity of the lungs and of the walls of the secondary tracheae (‘lateral diffusing capacity’) of two groups of Salticus scenicus with mean body masses of 2.69 mg (group A) and 5.28 mg (group B). The thickness of the gas-exchange epithelium of the lungs was 0.164 μm (group A) and 0.186 μm (group B) for the total diffusion barrier. The secondary tracheae were divided arbitrarily into seven classes according to their inner diameter (1–7 μm). The diffusion barriers of the tracheal walls tend to be thinnest (0.17 and 0.18 μm) for the smallest tracheae, the walls of the other tracheal classes having approximately the same thickness of diffusion barrier (0.24–0.32 μm).\n      \n        The calculated oxygen-diffusing capacity (DO2) for the lungs was 16.4 μl min–1 g–1 kPa–1 for group A and 12 μl min–1 g–1 kPa–1 for group B; the DO2 of the walls of all secondary tracheae was 5.91 μl min–1 g–1 kPa–1 for group A animals and 6.63 μl min–1 g–1 kPa–1 for group B animals.\n      \n        Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the tracheal system plays an important role in gas exchange in jumping spiders. Resting and low-activity oxygen consumption rates can be met by the lungs or the tracheae alone, while high oxygen demands can be met only if both respiratory systems are working together. Tracheae entering the prosoma have only 4–10 % of the total tracheal diffusing capacity, thus providing sufficient oxygen for the nervous system but not being able to prevent muscle fatigue. The similar thickness of the walls of all tracheal classes is consistent with the hypothesis that the secondary tube tracheae function as ‘tracheal lungs’, supplying the haemolymph and organs by lateral diffusion.\n      "},{"title":"Growth and metabolism of larval zebrafish: effects of swim training","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/24/4335","abstract":"\n        Larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) of three different age classes (‘yolk-sac’ larvae, 96 h; ‘swim-up’ larvae, 9 days old; and ‘free-swimming’ larvae, 21 days old) were trained for 2, 6 and 11 days, respectively, to swim at 0 body lengths per second (BL s–1), 2 BL s–1 and 5 BL s–1. Survival was significantly diminished in larvae trained at 5 BL s–1 compared to controls (0 BL s–1). Although training produced no significant differences in mass and length, the youngest larvae absorbed their yolk at a faster rate during training. Routine oxygen consumption (ṀO2r) and mass-specific routine oxygen consumption (ṀO2r,m) were not significantly affected by chronic training in the yolk-sac larvae and swim-up larvae. However, trained free-swimming larvae had a significantly higher ṀO2r (after 11 days of training) and ṀO2r,m (after 8 and 11 days of training) compared to control larvae. Trained free-swimming larvae consumed significantly less oxygen during swimming compared to control larvae, as measured by closed-system respirometry. Trained yolk-sac larvae exposed to increasing hypoxia levels were more effective O2 regulators. Additionally, training enhanced survival during exposure to extreme hypoxia in all age groups. Thus, physiological acclimation to chronic swimming occurs in the earliest stages of life in the zebrafish.\n      "},{"title":"The diving behaviour of green turtles undertaking oceanic migration to and from Ascension Island: dive durations, dive profiles and depth distribution","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/23/4093","abstract":"\n        Satellite telemetry was used to record the submergence duration of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) as they migrated from Ascension Island to Brazil (N=12 individuals) while time/depth recorders (TDRs) were used to examine the depth distribution and dive profiles of individuals returning to Ascension Island to nest after experimental displacement (N=5 individuals). Satellite telemetry revealed that most submergences were short (<5 min) but that some submergences were longer (>20 min), particularly at night. TDRs revealed that much of the time was spent conducting short (2–4 min), shallow (approximately 0.9–1.5 m) dives, consistent with predictions for optimisation of near-surface travelling, while long (typically 20–30 min), deep (typically 10–20 m) dives had a distinctive profile found in other marine reptiles. These results suggest that green turtles crossing the Atlantic do not behave invariantly, but instead alternate between periods of travelling just beneath the surface and diving deeper. These deep dives may have evolved to reduce silhouetting against the surface, which would make turtles more susceptible to visual predators such as large sharks.\n      "},{"title":"The effects of depth on the cardiac and behavioural responses of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) during voluntary diving","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/23/4081","abstract":"\n        Heart rate and dive behaviour were monitored in double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) during shallow (1 m) and deep diving (12 m), after breathing different gas mixtures, to investigate the role of depth and the accompanying changes in blood gas levels in cardiac and behavioural control during voluntary diving. Pre-dive heart rate in both shallow- and deep-diving birds was approximately three times the resting heart rate (137.9±17.5 beats min–1; mean ± s.d., N=5), falling abruptly upon submersion to around 200–250 beats min–1. During shallow diving, the initial reduction in heart rate was followed by a secondary, more gradual decline, to around the resting level. In contrast, during deep diving, heart rate stabilised at 200–250 beats min–1. In dives of similar duration, mean dive heart rate was significantly lower during shallow diving (163.2±14.0 beats min–1) than during deep diving (216.4±7.7 beats min–1), but in both cases was significantly above the resting value. The difference in cardiac response is probably due to an increase in arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) during the descent phase of deep dives (compression hyperoxia). Exposure to a hyperoxic gas mixture before shallow diving significantly increased mean dive heart rate, while exposure to a hypoxic gas mixture in both the shallow and deep dive tanks significantly reduced mean dive heart rate. In contrast, breathing hypercapnic gas before diving had no significant effect on dive heart rate. We suggest that the cardiac response to voluntary diving in double-crested cormorants is strongly influenced by changes in blood oxygen levels throughout the dive. Dive duration was unaffected by alterations in inspired gas composition, but surface interval duration decreased during hyperoxic gas exposure and increased during hypoxic gas exposure. The most efficient dive pattern (highest dive/pause ratio) was observed after hyperoxic exposure. Our study suggests that blood oxygen level is a powerful stimulus that facilitates the cardiac and behavioural adjustments during foraging that are important components of a strategy allowing double-crested cormorants to maximise the time spent under water and, hence, potential foraging time.\n      "},{"title":"Simulated weightlessness alters the nycthemeral distribution of energy expenditure in rats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/23/4107","abstract":"\n        The energy metabolism adaptations to simulated weightlessness in rats by hindlimb tail suspension are unknown. 12 male rats were assigned to 7 days of isolation, 7 days of habituation to the suspension device, 10 days of simulated weightlessness, and 3 days of recovery. The 24-hour energy expenditure was measured by continuous indirect calorimetry. We calculated the 12-hour energy expenditure during the active (night) and inactive (day) periods, the minimal observed metabolic rates with the day values taken as an index of the basal metabolic rate, and the non-basal energy expenditure representing the cost of physical activity plus the diet-induced thermogenesis. Suspension did not change the mean 24-hour energy expenditure (360.8±15.3 J min–1 kg–0.67), but reduced the night/day difference by 64 % (P<0.05) through a concomitant drop in night-energy expenditure and increase in day values. The difference between night and day minimal metabolic rates was reduced by 81 % (P<0.05), and the transient rise in day values suggests an early and moderate basal metabolic rate increase (9 %). An overall 19 % reduction in non-basal energy expenditure was observed during simulated weightlessness (P<0.05), which was mainly attributable to a reduction in the cost of physical activity. 3 days of recovery restored the night/day differences but increased the 24-hour energy expenditure by 10 % (P<0.05). In conclusion, hindlimb tail suspension in rats did not alter the 24-hour energy expenditure, but it transiently increased the basal metabolic rate, and altered both the energy expended on physical activity and the nycthemeral distribution of motor activity. These data suggest that the circadian rhythms of energy expenditure are affected during simulated weightlessness.\n      "},{"title":"Evidence for facilitated lactate uptake in lizard skeletal muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/23/4099","abstract":"\n        To understand more fully lactate metabolism in reptilian muscle, lactate uptake in lizard skeletal muscle was measured and its similarities to the monocarboxylate transport system found in mammals were examined.

N-ethymaleimide (ETH) (10 mmol l–1) also caused a reduction in the rate of uptake, but measurements of adenylate and phosphocreatine concentrations show that ETH had serious effects on rIF and wIF and may not be appropriate for transport inhibition studies in reptiles. The higher net uptake rate by rIF than by wIF agrees with the fact that rIF shows much higher rates of lactate utilization and incorporation into glycogen than wIF. This study also suggests that lactate uptake by reptilian muscle is similar to that by mammalian muscle and that, evolutionarily, this transport system may be relatively conserved even in animals with very different patterns of lactate metabolism.\n      "},{"title":"The cultured branchial epithelium of the rainbow trout as a model for diffusive fluxes of ammonia across the fish gill","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/23/4115","abstract":"\n        A novel branchial epithelial preparation grown in L-15 medium in culture was used as a model system for understanding the diffusion of ammonia across the gills of the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. The epithelium is known to contain both respiratory and mitochondria-rich cells in the approximate proportion in which they occur in vivo and to exhibit diffusive fluxes of Na+ and Cl– similar to in vivo values, but does not exhibit active apical-to-basolateral transport of Na+. Transepithelial resistance and paracellular permeability are also known to increase when the apical medium is changed from L-15 medium (symmetrical conditions) to fresh water (asymmetrical conditions). In the present study, net basolateral-to-apical ammonia fluxes increased as basolateral total ammonia concentration, basolateral-to-apical pH gradients and basolateral-to-apical PNH3 gradients were experimentally increased and were greater under asymmetrical than under symmetrical conditions. The slope of the relationship between ammonia flux and PNH3 gradient (i.e. NH3 permeability) was the same under both conditions and similar to values for other epithelia. The higher fluxes under asymmetrical conditions were explained by an apparent diffusive flux of NH4+ that was linearly correlated with transepithelial conductance and was probably explained by the higher electrochemical gradient and higher paracellular permeability when fresh water was present on the apical surface. In this situation, NH4+ diffusion was greater than NH3 diffusion under conditions representative of in vivo values, but overall fluxes amounted to only approximately 20 % of those in vivo. These results suggest that branchial ammonia excretion in the intact animal is unlikely to be explained by diffusion alone and, therefore, that carrier-mediated transport may play an important role.\n      "},{"title":"The efficiency of an asynchronous flight muscle from a beetle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/23/4125","abstract":"\n        Mechanical power output and metabolic power input were measured from an asynchronous flight muscle, the basalar muscle of the beetle Cotinus mutabilis. Mechanical power output was determined using the work loop technique and metabolic power input by monitoring CO2 production or both CO2 production and O2 consumption. At 35°C, and with conditions that maximized power output (60 Hz sinusoidal strain, optimal muscle length and strain amplitude, 60 Hz stimulation frequency), the peak mechanical power output during a 10 s burst was approximately 140 W kg–1, the respiratory coefficient 0.83 and the muscle efficiency 14–16 %. The stimulus intensity used was the minimal required to achieve a maximal isometric tetanus. Increasing or decreasing the stimulus intensity from this level changed mechanical power output but not efficiency, indicating that the efficiency measurements were not contaminated by excitation of muscles adjacent to that from which the mechanical recordings were made. The CO2 produced during an isometric tetanus was approximately half that during a bout of similar stimulation but with imposed sinusoidal strain and work output, suggesting that up to 50 % of the energy input may go to muscle activation costs. Reducing the stimulus frequency to 30 Hz from its usual value of 60 Hz reduced mechanical power output but had no significant effect on efficiency. Increasing the frequency of the sinusoidal strain from 60 to 90 Hz reduced power output but not CO2 consumption; hence, there was a decline in efficiency. The respiratory coefficient was the same for 10 s and 30 s bursts of activity, suggesting that there was no major change in the fuel used over this time range.\n      \n        The mass-specific mechanical power output and the efficiency of the beetle muscle were each 2–3 times greater than values measured in previous studies, using similar techniques, from locust flight muscles, which are synchronous muscles.

All three surfactant proteins were found at the site of gas exchange in the lungs of joeys at all ages, even at birth when the lungs are in the early stages of the terminal air-sac phase. Co-cultures of alveolar type II cells and fibroblasts were isolated from the lungs of 30- and 70-day-old joeys and incubated with the hormones dexamethasone (10 μmol l–1), prolactin (1 μmol l–1) or triiodothyronine (100 μmol l–1) or with the autonomic secretagogues isoproterenol (100 μmol l–1) or carbamylcholine chloride (100 μmol l–1). Basal secretion of PC was greater at 30 days of age than at 70 days. Co-cultures responded to all five agonists at 30 days of age, but only the autonomic secretagogues caused a significant increase in PC secretion at 70 days of age. This demonstrates that, as the cells mature, their activity and responsiveness are reduced. The presence of the surfactant proteins at the site of gas exchange at birth suggests that the system is fully functional. It appears that surfactant development is coupled with the terminal air-sac phase of lung development rather than with birth, the length of gestation or the onset of air-breathing.\n      "},{"title":"Swimbladder gas gland cells cultured on permeable supports regain their characteristic polarity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/23/4023","abstract":"\n        A cell culture system has been developed in which swimbladder gas gland cells from the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) were cultured on a permeable support.

The rates of heat gain of red muscle during warming were significantly higher than the rates of heat loss during cooling, and neither the magnitude of the change in Ta nor the direction of change in Ta had a significant effect on red muscle latency time. Our findings for mako red muscle are similar to those recorded for tunas and suggest modulation of retial heat-exchange efficiency as the underlying mechanism controlling heat balance. However, the red muscle temperatures measured in swimming makos (0.3–3°C above Ta) are cooler than those measured previously in larger decked makos. Also, the finding of non-stable stomach temperatures contrasts with the predicted independence from Ta recorded in telemetry studies of mako and white sharks.

Co-injection of trace amounts of [125I]LPS together with excess amounts of formaldehyde-treated albumin (FSA), a ligand for the scavenger receptor, significantly inhibited the accumulation of the radiotracer in heart only.

Mannan, a ligand for the mannose receptor, did not compete for uptake. Kinetic studies on the uptake and degradation of [125I]LPS in cultured atrial endocardial cells revealed no degradation after 48 h of culture.

While normal larvae consumed the diets in a ratio of approximately 2:1 protein:carbohydrate (w/w), parasitized insects consumed a ratio of approximately 1:1. The altered nutrient ratio consumed by parasitized insects was principally due to a decrease in consumption of the protein diet, and was only partially explained by their lower growth. Conditioning larvae for 1 day to either one of the choice diets had little effect on subsequent dietary intake over a 2-day feeding period. Conditioned larvae, regardless of parasitism, initially fed on the opposite diet immediately after conditioning. Although this suggests that the altered nutrient intake displayed by parasitized insects was not due to any failure in their capacity for dietary selection, these results do not definitively demonstrate an altered nutrient intake target by parasitized larvae. Rather, parasitism may compromise dietary selection, resulting in random feeding. When parasitized larvae were maintained on several isocaloric diets with a varying ratio of casein and sucrose, those larvae feeding on the diet with a ratio of 1:1 of these nutrients supported the largest parasite population. Previous investigation of larvae maintained on a single artificial diet established that parasitized insects display an aberrant induction of gluconeogenesis, so that haemolymph trehalose is maintained at a level equivalent to that of normal insects. In contrast, the present results demonstrated that parasitized larvae offered a choice of diets, and feeding at the altered nutrient ratio above, maintain haemolymph sugar but have the same level of gluconeogenesis as normal larvae given the same dietary choice. These investigations suggest that altered food selection by parasitized M. sexta larvae maintains metabolic homeostasis and, moreover, may be adaptive for C. congregata, potentially maximizing the number of parasites developing in a single host larva.\n      "},{"title":"Maneuvering in an arboreal habitat: the effects of turning angle on the locomotion of three sympatric ecomorphs of Anolis lizards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/23/4141","abstract":"\n        Although the maximal speeds of straight-ahead running are well-documented for many species of Anolis and other lizards, no previous study has experimentally determined the effects of turning on the locomotor performance of a lizard. Anolis lizards are a diverse group of arboreal species, and the discrete paths created by networks of perches in arboreal environments often force animals to turn in their natural habitats. For three species of Anolis with similar overall body size but different shape, we quantified the escape locomotor performance for arboreal locomotion on 4.8 cm diameter perches that were straight (0°) or had turning angles of 30° and 90°. The turning angle had widespread significant effects that were often species-dependent. This was shown by measuring the average gross velocity (including the times while the lizards paused) of the three species covering the middle 30 cm of a racetrack with either 30° or 90° turns. The results were expressed as a percentage of the gross velocity over the same distance on a straight racetrack. The values obtained for A. grahami (99 % for 30° turns and 79 % for 90° turns) showed a smaller effect of turning angle than for A. lineatopus (79 % for 30° turns and 50 % for 90° turns) and A. valencienni (74 % for 30° turns and 48 % for 90° turns). Consequently, the rank order of species based on speed depended on the angle of the turn. Some of the magnitudes of decreased locomotor speed associated with turning exceeded those reported previously for the effects of decreasing perch diameter for these species. For all species, more pausing occurred with increased turning angle, with the twig ecomorph (A. valencienni) pausing the most. Approximately half the individuals of each species jumped to traverse the 90° turn, but some of the potential benefits of jumping for increasing speed were offset by pauses associated with preparing to jump or recovering balance immediately after a jump. The tail of Anolis lizards may facilitate the substantial rotation (>60°) of the body that often occurred in the airborne phase of the jumps.\n      "},{"title":"The role of angiotensin II in regulating catecholamine secretion during hypoxia in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/23/4169","abstract":"\n        Experiments were performed in vivo on chronically cannulated adult rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to assess the involvement of serotonergic or muscarinic receptor stimulation or activation of the renin–angiotensin system in eliciting catecholamine release during acute hypoxia during periods of nicotinic receptor desensitisation.Despite nicotinic receptor desensitisation induced by intravenous infusion of nicotine (1.3×10–5 mol kg–1 h–1), plasma catecholamine levels were increased to levels (adrenaline plus noradrenaline 125–200 nmol l–1) similar to those in control fish during severe hypoxia (40–45 mmHg; 5.3–6.0 kPa). Blockade of serotonergic receptors using methysergide or of muscarinic receptors using atropine did not affect the ability of fish to elevate circulating catecholamine levels during hypoxia. However, selective blockade of the renin–angiotensin system, using lisinopril to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme, prevented the elevation of both angiotensin II and circulating catecholamine levels in acutely hypoxic fish experiencing nicotinic receptor desensitisation. In fish possessing functional nicotinic receptors, angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade attenuated but did not prevent the elevation of plasma catecholamine levels during hypoxia. The results of this study indicate that the renin–angiotensin system is activated during hypoxia and plays a role in eliciting catecholamine release that is secondary to activation of nicotinic receptors. However, under conditions of nicotinic receptor desensitisation, activation of the renin–angiotensin system during hypoxia is a prerequisite for catecholamine release.\n      "},{"title":"A snake venom phospholipase A2 blocks malaria parasite development in the mosquito midgut by inhibiting ookinete association with the midgut surface","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/23/4157","abstract":"\n        Oocyst formation is a critical stage in the development of the malaria parasite in the mosquito. We have discovered that the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from the venom of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus) inhibits oocyst formation when added to infected chicken blood and fed to mosquitoes. A similar transmission-blocking activity was demonstrated for PLA2s from the venom of other snakes and from the honeybee. This effect is seen both with the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum and with the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum developing in their respective mosquito hosts. The inhibition occurs even in the presence of an irreversible inhibitor of the active site of PLA2, indicating that the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme is not required for the antiparasitic effect. Inhibition is also seen when the enzyme is fed to mosquitoes together with ookinetes, suggesting that the inhibition occurs after ookinete maturation. PLA2 has no direct effect on the parasite. However, pretreatment of midguts with PLA2 (catalytically active or inactive) dramatically lowers the level of ookinete/midgut association in vitro. It appears, therefore, that PLA2 is acting by associating with the midgut surface and preventing ookinete attachment to this surface. Thus, PLA2 is an excellent candidate for expression in transgenic mosquitoes as a means of inhibiting the transmission of malaria.\n      "},{"title":"Effects of training on forced submersion responses in harbor seals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3877","abstract":"\n        In several pinniped species, the heart rates observed during unrestrained dives are frequently higher than the severe bradycardias recorded during forced submersions. To examine other physiological components of the classic ‘dive response’ during such moderate bradycardias, a training protocol was developed to habituate harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) to short forced submersions. Significant changes were observed between physiological measurements made during naive and trained submersions (3–3.5 min). Differences were found in measurements of heart rate during submersion (naive 18±4.3 beats min–1 versus trained 35±3.4 beats min–1), muscle blood flow measured using laser-Doppler flowmetry (naive 1.8±0.8 ml min–1 100 g–1 versus trained 5.8±3.9 ml min–1 100 g–1), change in venous PO2 (naive –0.44±1.25 kPa versus trained –1.48±0.76 kPa) and muscle deoxygenation rate (naive –0.67±0.27 mvd s–1 versus trained –0.51±0.18 mvd s–1, a relative measure of muscle oxygenation provided by the Vander Niroscope, where mvd are milli-vander units). In contrast to the naive situation, the post-submersion increase in plasma lactate levels was only rarely significant in trained seals. Resting eupneic (while breathing) heart rate and total oxygen consumption rates (measured in two seals) were not significantly different between the naive and trained states. This training protocol revealed that the higher heart rate and greater muscle blood flow in the trained seals were associated with a lower muscle deoxygenation rate, presumably secondary to greater extraction of blood O2 during trained submersions. Supplementation of muscle oxygenation by blood O2 delivery during diving would increase the rate of blood O2 depletion but could prolong the duration of aerobic muscle metabolism during diving. This alteration of the dive response may increase the metabolic efficiency of diving.\n      "},{"title":"Platelet-activating-factor-hydrolyzing phospholipase C in the salivary glands and saliva of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3887","abstract":"\n        A phospholipase C activity specific for platelet-activating factor (PAF), named PAF phosphorylcholine hydrolase, was found in the salivary glands and saliva of the human-feeding mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus.

The TBA consists of a set of well-developed teeth on the dorsal surface of the anterior hyoid (basihyal) and an opposing set of teeth on the roof of the mouth (vomer). A kinematic analysis of behaviors associated with the TBA in the brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis was performed using high-speed video (250 frames s–1). Two distinct behaviors were identified, raking and open-mouth chewing. Univariate analysis demonstrated that these behaviors were significantly different from one another. The power stroke of raking is characterized by significantly greater neurocranial elevation (raking, 36°; open-mouth chewing, 16°) and retraction of the pectoral girdle (raking, 0.85 cm or 21 % of head length; open-mouth chewing, 0.41 cm or 10 % of head length). Open-mouth chewing is characterized predominantly by dorso-ventral excursions of the anterior hyoid (open-mouth chewing, 0.26 cm; raking, 0.14 cm). Raking is significantly shorter in duration (mean 49 ms) than open-mouth chewing (mean 77 ms). When presented with three different types of prey (crickets, fish or worms), Salvelinus fontinalis showed no variation in raking behavior, indicating that raking is highly stereotyped. In contrast, when feeding on worms, Salvelinus fontinalis modulated open-mouth chewing behavior with shorter durations to maximum displacement (at least 20 ms shorter than for either fish or cricket), although the magnitude of displacements did not vary. The reasons for the shorter duration of displacement variables while feeding on worms remains unclear. During post-capture processing behaviors in Salvelinus fontinalis, the magnitude of displacement variables is highly variable between individuals, but temporal patterns are not. This study characterizes two novel post-capture feeding behaviors and modulation of those behaviors in salmonids.\n      "},{"title":"Swimming speeds and buoyancy compensation of migrating adult chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta revealed by speed/depth/acceleration data logger","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3895","abstract":"\n        Although the homing migration of Pacific salmon is well documented, the swimming behaviour of the returning salmon has been poorly described, principally as a result of the difficulties encountered in monitoring salmon behaviour in the sea. The present study describes the use of a recently developed electronic data logger to obtain simultaneous recordings of the swimming speed, depth, fin-beating activity and body angle of free-ranging chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta during their homing migration in coastal waters. Chum salmon migrated horizontally at speeds of 1.5–3.0 km h–1. The gross horizontal distance salmon moved during total recording periods were 1.24- to 19.0-fold greater than the net distance from the release site to the retrieval points. It is suggested that homing salmon did not drift passively but swam actively to the spawning grounds. Salmon preferred the surface water, but also made frequent vertical migrations. The travelled depth of each salmon ranged from 0.36 to 0.64 km per hour. Salmon descended at faster rates and steeper angles than they ascended. Both tailbeat frequency and tail thrust were higher during the ascent than the descent phase. These results suggest that chum salmon spent more energy during the ascent than the descent phase. Profiles of descent rate assumed an arched shape with respect to a change in hydrostatic pressure, while ascent rate increased with decreasing depth. High tailbeat frequencies were found during the course of ascent, which suggests that the salmon did not regulate the volume of air in the swim bladder during short-term vertical migrations.\n      "},{"title":"Influence of increased rotational inertia on the turning performance of humans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3927","abstract":"\n        The rotational inertia of an animal can be expected to influence directly its ability to execute rapid turning maneuvers. We hypothesized that a ninefold increase in rotational inertia would reduce maximum turning performance to one-ninth of control values. To test this prediction, we increased rotational inertia about the vertical axis of six human subjects and measured their ability to turn during maximum-effort jump turns. We measured the free moment about a vertical (i.e. yaw) axis as the subjects performed maximum-effort jump turns under three conditions: (i) unencumbered, (ii) wearing a backpack with a control weight and (iii) wearing a backpack of the same mass that increased the rotational inertia of the subject to 9.2 times that with the control weight. Rotational inertia measurements allowed us to estimate the angle turned during the take-off period (i.e. from jump initiation until the feet leave the ground) and the angular power and work of the maximum-effort turns. Surprisingly, the angle turned during take-off in the increased inertia trials was 44.7 % of that of the control trials, rather than the 10.9 % (9.2-fold reduction) expected on the basis of the increase in rotational inertia. When the subjects turned with increased rotational inertia, the maximum and mean torques exerted were, on average, 142 % and 190 %, respectively, of the values recorded during the control trials. Maximum torques during increased rotational inertia trials actually approached isometric maxima. In the increased rotational inertia trials, the angular impulse was 252 % of that of the control trials and the take-off period was 130 % of that of the control trials. By exerting larger torques over longer take-off periods, the subjects were able partially to compensate for the excess rotational inertia. In contrast to the observed changes in torque, maximum and mean angular power were highest in the unencumbered trials and lowest in the increased inertia trials. On the basis of a decreased ability to generate vertical force when turning and of our estimates of angular power, we speculate that the greater than expected turning performance was due (i) to adjustments in the pattern of muscle recruitment and (ii) to a reduction in the velocity of muscle shortening that resulted in increased muscle forces.\n      "},{"title":"Influence of rotational inertia on turning performance of theropod dinosaurs: clues from humans with increased rotational inertia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3917","abstract":"\n        The turning agility of theropod dinosaurs may have been severely limited by the large rotational inertia of their horizontal trunks and tails. Bodies with mass distributed far from the axis of rotation have much greater rotational inertia than bodies with the same mass distributed close to the axis of rotation. In this study, we increased the rotational inertia about the vertical axis of human subjects 9.2-fold, to match our estimate for theropods the size of humans, and measured the ability of the subjects to turn. To determine the effect of the increased rotational inertia on maximum turning capability, five subjects jumped vertically while attempting to rotate as far as possible about their vertical axis. This test resulted in a decrease in the average angle turned to 20 % of the control value. We also tested the ability of nine subjects to run as rapidly as possible through a tight slalom course of six 90° turns. When the subjects ran with the 9.2-fold greater rotational inertia, the average velocity through the course decreased to 77 % of the control velocity. When the subjects ran the same course but were constrained as to where they placed their feet, the average velocity through the course decreased to 65 % of the control velocity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that rotational inertia may have limited the turning performance of theropods. They also indicate that the effect of rotational inertia on turning performance is dependent on the type of turning behavior. Characters such as retroverted pubes, reduced tail length, decreased body size, pneumatic vertebrae and the absence of teeth reduced rotational inertia in derived theropods and probably, therefore, improved their turning agility. To reduce rotational inertia, theropods may have run with an arched back and tail, an S-curved neck and forelimbs held backwards against the body.\n      "},{"title":"Evidence for a mineralocorticoid-like receptor linked to branchial chloride cell proliferation in freshwater rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3953","abstract":"\n        Fish acclimated to ion-deficient water exhibit proliferation of branchial chloride cells. The objective of the present study was to investigate the role of cortisol in this response using the corticosteroid receptor antagonists RU486 and spironolactone. RU486 is a potent antagonist of the glucocorticoid actions of cortisol, whereas spironolactone exhibits high-affinity binding to mineralocorticoid receptors, with a resulting blockade of mineralocorticoid properties in mammals. Untreated rainbow trout, as well as rainbow trout given a single intraperitoneal implant of coconut oil alone, coconut oil containing RU486 (0.5 mg g–1) or coconut oil containing spironolactone (0.1 mg g–1), were exposed to either dechlorinated city-of-Ottawa tapwater or artificial softwater for 7 days. Neither corticosteroid antagonist nor acclimation condition affected circulating plasma cortisol levels, plasma ion concentrations or gill Na+-K+-ATPase activity. Kidney Na+-K+-ATPase activity was significantly higher in softwater-acclimated fish than in fish held in dechlorinated tapwater. In addition, whereas RU486 treatment was found to be without effect on gill morphometrics, treatment with spironolactone inhibited the proliferation of chloride cells normally associated with acclimation to ion-deficient water. The results of the present study provide further evidence for the mineralocorticoid actions of cortisol in freshwater fish, specifically in eliciting chloride cell proliferation. Furthermore, these results support the hypothesis that distinct glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor populations are present in teleost fish, despite the apparent absence of the classic mineralocorticoid hormone, aldosterone.\n      "},{"title":"The relative roles of external and internal CO2 versus H+ in eliciting the cardiorespiratory responses of Salmo salar and Squalus acanthias to hypercarbia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3963","abstract":"\n        Fish breathing hypercarbic water encounter externally elevated PCO2 and proton levels ([H+]) and experience an associated internal respiratory acidosis, an elevation of blood PCO2 and [H+].

We found that continuous feeding of oleander sap during the larval period significantly affects fertility in males but not in females. This effect was also induced by direct injection of oleander sap into the hemocoel of 2-day-old pupae. Histological analyses of developing testes following oleander injection revealed a developmental delay and progressively more severe morphological abnormalities in the later stages of development. The effects of oleander sap on spermatogenesis in H. assulta were associated with greatly reduced levels of the two major polyamines, spermidine and spermine, in testis compared with saline-injected controls. In contrast, levels of putrescine, which is a precursor of both spermidine and spermine, and the activities of the enzymes ornithine decarboxylase and arginine decarboxylase, which are involved in the biosynthesis of putrescine, were initially elevated following oleander injection, but subsequently failed to undergo the induction that normally occurs during late pupal development. The effects of oleander sap on spermidine and spermine levels could be the result of direct inhibition by chemical constituents of the oleander sap of one of the enzymes used in common in the conversions of putrescine to spermidine and spermidine to spermine; alternatively, these effects on polyamine metabolism could be secondary to the disruption of a more fundamental process in the developmental program guiding spermatogenesis in H. assulta.\n      "},{"title":"Regulation of intracellular pH in anoxia-tolerant and anoxia-intolerant teleost hepatocytes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3943","abstract":"\n        Mechanisms of intracellular pH (pHi) regulation were investigated in anoxia-tolerant hepatocytes from goldfish Carassius auratus, and compared to the situation in the anoxia-intolerant hepatocytes from trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Under normoxic conditions, the pHi of goldfish hepatocytes was regulated by a Na+/H+ exchanger and a Na+-independent Cl–/HCO3– exchanger, the latter being activated only after acidification of the cells. Mechanisms of acid secretion appear to be fuelled, at least in part, by lactate formation under fully aerobic conditions, as inhibition of glycolysis caused a drastic reduction of steady state proton release. In trout hepatocytes both a Na+/H+ exchanger and a Cl–/HCO3– exchanger were found to be tonically active, as described previously. During chemical anoxia a constant pHi was maintained in goldfish hepatocytes, whereas it was reversibly reduced by 0.3 units in the trout cells. Under these conditions a reversible increase in the rate of acid secretion was induced in the cells from both species. In the goldfish cells this was based on a SITS-sensitive transporter, possibly involving export of lactate, with no contribution from Na+/H+ exchange. By contrast, in hepatocytes from trout, CN-induced acid secretion was dominated by the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Brief exposure to extracellular acidosis had no dramatic effects on the energetics of hepatocytes from either species.\n      "},{"title":"Carbonic anhydrase activity in tissues of the icefish Chionodraco hamatus and of the red-blooded teleosts Trematomus bernacchii and Anguilla anguilla","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3983","abstract":"\n        Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity was measured in blood, intestine, kidney and gill of two Antarctic teleosts, the haemoglobinless Chionodraco hamatus and the red-blooded Trematomus bernacchii, and of the temperate teleost Anguilla anguilla.

Whether the increase occurs as a normal ‘preparation for birth’, i.e. by a genetically determined mechanism, or in response to increased levels of oxygen, i.e. in response to the environment, is not completely understood. We examined the activities of catalase, SOD and GPx in the developing lungs of two oviparous vertebrate species, the chicken (Gallus gallus) and an agamid lizard (Pogona vitticeps), and in a metamorphosing vertebrate, the anuran Limnodynastes terraereginae. During in ovo development embryos come into contact with higher levels of environmental oxygen, and at a much earlier stage of development, compared with the intrauterine development of mammals. Furthermore, in metamorphosing frogs, the lungs are inflated at an early stage to aid in buoyancy, although the gas-exchange function only develops much later upon final metamorphosis. Here, we hypothesise that the activity of the AOE will be elevated relatively much earlier during development in both oviparous and metamorphosing vertebrates. We also examined the effect of mild hypoxia (17 % oxygen) on the development of the pulmonary AOE in the chicken, to test the hypothesis that these enzymes are responsive to environmental oxygen. In the normoxic lung of both Gallus gallus and Pogona vitticeps, catalase and GPx activities were significantly increased in late incubation, whereas SOD activity decreased in late incubation. Catalase and SOD activities were virtually identical in hypoxic and normoxic embryos of the chicken, but GPx activity was significantly affected by hypoxia. In the developing frog, the activities of all enzymes were high at stage 30, demonstrating that the system is active before the lung displays any significant gas-exchange function. SOD and GPx activity did not increase further with development. Catalase activity increased after stage 40, presumably correlating with an increase in air-breathing. In summary, catalase expression in the two oviparous vertebrates appears to be completely under genetic control as the activity of this enzyme does not change in response to changes in oxygen tension. However, in tadpoles, catalase may be responsive to environmental oxygen. SOD also appears to follow a largely genetically determined program in all species. Under normoxic conditions, GPx appears to follow a genetically determined developmental pattern, but this enzyme demonstrated the largest capacity to respond to environmental oxygen fluctuations. In conclusion, it appears that the AOE are differentially regulated. Furthermore, the AOE in the different species appear to have evolved different levels of dependency on environmental variables. Finally, the late developmental increase in AOE activity seen in mammals is not as pronounced in oviparous and metamorphosing vertebrates.\n      "},{"title":"Migrating songbirds tested in computer-controlled Emlen funnels use stellar cues for a time-independent compass","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3855","abstract":"\n        This paper investigates how young pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, and blackcaps, Sylvia atricapilla, interpret and use celestial cues.

Simultaneously, the following behavioural indicators of diving ability increased: the proportion of time spent in the water, dive depth, dive duration, bottom time and maximum daily swimming velocity. In addition, the proportion of dives that were identified by cluster analyses as being U-shaped increased significantly with age. On the basis of the measured blood oxygen stores, less than 1 % of the recorded dives exceeded the calculated aerobic dive limit. Thus, development in blood oxygen stores or rates of oxygen consumption did not seem to restrain the rate of neonatal dive development in harbour seals.

Controls received the same feed but without l-tryptophan supplementation. The fish were fed to satiety daily, and their individual feed intake was recorded. Aggressive behaviour was quantified again after 3 and 7 days of l-tryptophan feeding using the resident/intruder test. Feeding the fish l-tryptophan-supplemented feed for 3 days had no effect on aggressive behaviour, whereas feeding the fish l-tryptophan-supplemented feed for 7 days significantly suppressed aggressive behaviour in the fish, an effect seen at both levels of l-tryptophan supplementation. Fish fed l-tryptophan-supplemented feed showed elevated plasma and brain levels of l-tryptophan. The amino acid l-tryptophan is the precursor of serotonin, and supplementary dietary l-tryptophan was found to elevate levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and the 5-HIAA/serotonin concentration ratio in the brain. Neither feed intake nor plasma cortisol level was significantly affected by dietary l-tryptophan. Central serotonin is believed to have an inhibitory effect on aggressive behaviour, and it is suggested that the suppressive effect of dietary l-tryptophan on aggressive behaviour is mediated by an elevation of brain serotonergic activity.\n      "},{"title":"The femur–tibia control system in a proscopiid (Caelifera, Orthoptera): a test for assumptions on the functional basis and evolution of twig mimesis in stick insects","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3815","abstract":"\n        The extremely slow return movements observed in stick insects (phasmids) after imposed changes in posture are termed catalepsy.

The high gain, in turn, causes the system to work close to instability, and this may have driven the evolution of gain control mechanisms. Although these statements represent plausible assumptions, based on correlated occurrence, they remain largely hypothetical like many ideas concerning evolutionary tendencies. To test these hypotheses, we studied catalepsy and the relevant properties of the femur–tibia control system in the middle and hind legs of Prosarthria teretrirostris.cf. Prosarthria teretrirostris is a proscopiid closely related to grasshoppers and locusts. With its slender, green-to-brown body and legs, it shows clear morphological twig mimesis, which has evolved independently of the well-known twig mimesis in stick insects. The animals show clear catalepsy. The main properties of femur–tibia joint control are remarkably similar between proscopiids and stick insects (e.g. the marked sensitivity to movement velocity rather than to joint position and the non-linear dependency of the time constants of response decay on movement velocity), but there are also important differences (habituation and activity-related mechanisms of gain control are absent). Together, these results validate the main concepts that have been developed concerning the neural basis and evolution of catalepsy in stick insects and its relationship to twig mimesis, while demonstrating that ideas on the role of habituation and gain control should be refined.\n      "},{"title":"Na++K+-ATPase in gills of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus: cDNA sequencing and salinity-related expression of α-subunit mRNA and protein","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/4005","abstract":"\n        Many studies have shown that hyperosmoregulation in euryhaline crabs is accompanied by enhanced Na++K+-ATPase activity in the posterior gills, but it remains unclear whether the response is due to regulation of pre-existing enzyme or to increased gene transcription and mRNA translation. To address this question, the complete open reading frame and 3′ and 5′ untranslated regions of the mRNA coding for the α-subunit of Na++K+-ATPase from the blue crab Callinectes sapidus were amplified by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequenced. The resulting 3828-nucleotide cDNA encodes a putative 1039-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 115.6 kDa. Hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequence indicated eight membrane-spanning regions, in agreement with previously suggested topologies. The α-subunit amino acid sequence is highly conserved among species, with the blue crab sequence showing 81–83 % identity to those of other arthropods and 74–77 % identity to those of vertebrate species. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed high levels of α-subunit mRNA in posterior gills 6–8 compared with anterior gills 3–5. Western blots of gill plasma membranes revealed a single Na++K+-ATPase α-subunit protein band of the expected size. The posterior gills contained a much higher level of α-subunit protein than the anterior gills, in agreement with previous measurements of enzyme activity. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that the Na++K+-ATPase α-subunit protein detected by α5 antibody is localized to the basolateral membrane region of gill epithelial cells. Transfer of blue crabs from 35 to 5 ‰ salinity was not accompanied by notable differences in the relative proportions of α-subunit mRNA and protein in the posterior gills, suggesting that the enhanced Na++K+-ATPase enzyme activity that accompanies the hyperosmoregulatory response may result from post-translational regulatory processes.\n      "},{"title":"The acoustic advantage of hunting at low heights above water: behavioural experiments on the European ‘trawling’ bats Myotis capaccinii, M. dasycneme and M. daubentonii","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3843","abstract":"\n        We have demonstrated in behavioural experiments that success in capturing prey from surfaces in ‘trawling Myotis’ (Leuconoë-type) depends on the acoustic properties of the surface on which the prey is presented. Two types of surface structure were ensonified with artificial bat signals to probe their acoustic characteristics. We have shown that perception of prey by echolocation is easier if the prey is presented on a smooth surface (such as calm water) than if it is presented on a structured surface (such as vegetation or the ground). This is because the smooth surface reflects a much lower level of clutter echoes than the structured one if ensonified at an angle typical for bats foraging low over water. The ensonification experiments revealed that the sound pressure level of the echo was even higher for mealworms on a smooth surface than for mealworms suspended in air. This might be because waves travelling via the surface also contribute to the echo (e.g. reflection from the surface to the mealworm, back to the surface and then to the receiver). From the behavioural experiments, we conclude that ‘trawling Myotis’ take isolated objects on smooth (water) surfaces for prey. Those objects reflect isolated, stationary acoustic glints back to the echolocating bats. Conversely, ‘trawling Myotis’ will not recognise prey if prey echoes are embedded in numerous clutter echoes. We have demonstrated marked similarities between the three European ‘trawling Myotis’ species M. dasycneme, M. daubentonii and M. capaccinii in echolocation behaviour, search image, foraging strategy and prey perception. We propose that a combination of prey abundance and acoustic advantages could have led to repeated and convergent evolution of ‘trawling’ bats in different parts of the world.\n      "},{"title":"Effects of hypoxia on egg capsule conductance in Ambystoma (Class Amphibia, Order Caudata)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3747","abstract":"\n        Aquatic amphibian eggs frequently encounter hypoxic conditions that have the potential to limit oxygen uptake and thereby slow embryonic development and hatching. Oxygen limitation might be avoided if egg capsule surface area and oxygen conductance increased in response to hypoxia. We investigated this possibility in two salamander species, Ambystoma annulatum and Ambystoma talpoideum. The effective surface area of egg capsules increased in response to hypoxia, which increased the conductance for oxygen and enhanced oxygen transport. The ability of amphibian eggs to adjust their conductance in response to oxygen availability may increase survival in hypoxic environments.\n      "},{"title":"Hearing and whistling in the deep sea: depth influences whistle spectra but does not attenuate hearing by white whales (Delphinapterus leucas) (Odontoceti, Cetacea)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/22/3829","abstract":"\n        Hearing is attenuated in the aerial ear of humans and other land mammals tested in pressure chambers as a result of middle ear impedance changes that result from increased air density. We tested the hypothesis, based on recent middle ear models, that increasing the density of middle ear air at depth might attenuate whale hearing. Two white whales Delphinapterus leucas made dives to a platform at a depth of 5, 100, 200 or 300 m in the Pacific Ocean. During dives to station on the platform for up to 12 min, the whales whistled in response to 500 ms tones projected at random intervals to assess their hearing threshold at each depth. Analysis of response whistle spectra, whistle latency in response to tones and hearing thresholds showed that the increased hydrostatic pressure at depth changed each whale’s whistle response at depth, but did not attenuate hearing overall. The finding that whale hearing is not attenuated at depth suggests that sound is conducted through the head tissues of the whale to the ear without requiring the usual ear drum/ossicular chain amplification of the aerial middle ear. These first ever hearing tests in the open ocean demonstrate that zones of audibility for human-made sounds are just as great throughout the depths to which these whales dive, or at least down to 300 m.\n      "},{"title":"Calcium currents from jellyfish striated muscle cells: preservation of phenotype, characterisation of currents and channel localisation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3717","abstract":"\n        When striated muscle cells of the jellyfish Polyorchis penicillatus were dissociated at 30°C they retained their in vivo morphology and the integrity of ionic currents. This contrasted with cells dissociated at room temperature that rarely expressed any inward currents. Whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings from dissociated muscle cells revealed that the inward component of the total ionic current consisted of only one calcium current. This calcium current activated at –70 mV, peaked at –30 mV, and inactivated within 5 ms. In comparison with barium and strontium ions, calcium ions were the preferred current carriers. Calcium channels can be blocked by dihydropyridines and nickel ions at micromolar levels. Several properties of this current are reminiscent of T-type calcium currents. Localisation of this channel using the fluorescent channel blocker fDHP and the fluorescent dye RH414 indicated that myofibres had a higher density of these channels than the somata.\n      "},{"title":"Chemolithoheterotrophy in a metazoan tissue: thiosulfate production matches ATP demand in ciliated mussel gills","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3755","abstract":"\n        The ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa inhabits sulfide-rich coastal sediments with a distribution that suggests a preference for exposure to sulfide. Although sulfide is a respiratory poison, it is also a potent reductant. Geukensia demissa gill mitochondria can use sulfide as a respiratory substrate for ATP production, and the gills of this species exhibit sulfide-supported oxygen consumption that matches the energy demand of ciliary beating. Here, we demonstrate (i) that the major product of G. demissa gill sulfide oxidation is thiosulfate and (ii) that the rate of sulfide oxidation also matches the cellular energy demand, resulting in a ratio near unity of oxygen consumed to sulfide oxidized at both low and high ciliary beat frequencies. A value for this ratio of unity is consistent with electrons from sulfide oxidation entering the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In the gills of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis from sulfide-free conditions, this ratio is 3–5 times higher, indicating an uncoupling of oxygen consumption from sulfide oxidation. Whereas M. edulis gills exhibit anaerobic metabolism during sulfide exposure, G. demissa gills do not, indicating a difference in sulfide tolerance between the two mussel species.\n      "},{"title":"The mechanical power output of the pectoralis muscle of blue-breasted quail (Coturnix chinensis): the in vivo length cycle and its implications for muscle performance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3587","abstract":"\n        Sonomicrometry and electromyographic (EMG) recordings were made for the pectoralis muscle of blue-breasted quail (Coturnix chinensis) during take-off and horizontal flight. In both modes of flight, the pectoralis strain trajectory was asymmetrical, with 70 % of the total cycle time spent shortening. EMG activity was found to start just before mid-upstroke and continued into the downstroke. The wingbeat frequency was 23 Hz, and the total strain was 23 % of the mean resting length.\n      \n        Bundles of fibres were dissected from the pectoralis and subjected in vitro to the in vivo length and activity patterns, whilst measuring force. The net power output was only 80 W kg–1 because of a large artefact in the force record during lengthening. For more realistic estimates of the pectoralis power output, we ignored the power absorbed by the muscle bundles during lengthening. The net power output during shortening averaged over the entire cycle was approximately 350 W kg–1, and in several preparations over 400 W kg–1. Sawtooth cycles were also examined for comparison with the simulation cycles, which were identical in all respects apart from the velocity profile. The power output during these cycles was found to be 14 % lower than during the in vivo strain trajectory. This difference was due to a higher velocity of stretch, which resulted in greater activation and higher power output throughout the later part of shortening, and the increase in shortening velocity towards the end of shortening, which facilitated deactivation.\n      \n        The muscle was found to operate at a mean length shorter than the plateau of the length/force relationship, which resulted in the isometric stress measured at the mean resting length being lower than is typically reported for striated muscle.\n      "},{"title":"The mechanical power output of the flight muscles of blue-breasted quail (Coturnix chinensis) during take-off","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3601","abstract":"\n        Blue-breasted quail (Coturnix chinensis) were filmed during take-off flights.

In addition, high-speed video recordings of the position of the wings over the course of the wing stroke, and morphological measurements, allowed us to calculate the aerodynamic and inertial power requirements. The total power output required from the pectoralis muscle was, on average, 390 W kg–1, which was similar to the highest measurements made on bundles of muscle fibres in vitro (433 W kg–1), although for one individual a power output of 530 W kg–1 was calculated. The majority of the power was required to increase the potential energy of the body. The power output of these muscles is the highest yet found for any muscle in repetitive contractions.\n      \n        We also calculated the power requirements during take-off flights in four other species in the family Phasianidae. Power output was found to be independent of body mass in this family. However, the precise scaling of burst power output within this group must await a better assessment of whether similar levels of performance were measured across the group. We extended our analysis to one species of hawk, several species of hummingbird and two species of bee. Remarkably, we concluded that, over a broad range of body size (0.0002–5 kg) and contractile frequency (5–186 Hz), the myofibrillar power output of flight muscles during short maximal bursts is very high (360–460 W kg–1) and shows very little scaling with body mass. The approximate constancy of power output means that the work output varies inversely with wingbeat frequency and reaches values of approximately 30–60 J kg–1 in the largest species.\n      "},{"title":"Functional implications of supercontracting muscle in the chameleon tongue retractors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3621","abstract":"\n        Chameleons capture prey items using a ballistic tongue projection mechanism that is unique among lizards. During prey capture, the tongue can be projected up to two full body lengths and may extend up to 600 % of its resting length. Being ambush predators, chameleons eat infrequently and take relatively large prey. The extreme tongue elongation (sixfold) and the need to be able to retract fairly heavy prey at any given distance from the mouth are likely to place constraints on the tongue retractor muscles. The data examined here show that in vivo retractor force production is almost constant for a wide range of projection distances. An examination of muscle physiology and of the ultrastructure of the tongue retractor muscle shows that this is the result (i) of active hyoid retraction, (ii) of large muscle filament overlap at maximal tongue extension and (iii) of the supercontractile properties of the tongue retractor muscles. We suggest that the chameleon tongue retractor muscles may have evolved supercontractile properties to enable a substantial force to be produced over a wide range of tongue projection distances. This enables chameleons successfully to retract even large prey from a variety of distances in their complex three-dimensional habitat.\n      "},{"title":"Embryonic temperature and the relative timing of muscle-specific genes during development in herring (Clupea harengus L.)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3629","abstract":"\n        Temperature influences many aspects of muscle development in herring (Clupea harengus). In Clyde herring, myofibril synthesis occurred later with respect to somite stage in embryos reared at 5°C compared with 12°C. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the relative timing of expression of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) transcripts changes with developmental temperature. Reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to clone partial coding regions of MyoD, myogenin and MyHC from juvenile Clyde herring. Embryos were reared at 5, 8 and 12°C, and the spatial and temporal expression patterns of transcripts were investigated using cRNA probes and in situ hybridisation. Antisense probes revealed a rostral–caudal progression of all three transcripts. MyoD transcription initially took place in the adaxial cells of the unsegmented, presomitic mesoderm, whereas myogenin transcription first occurred in newly formed somites. The MyHC gene transcript was not detected until approximately nine somites had formed. Since the somite stage at which the MRFs and MyHC were first expressed was independent of temperature, the hypothesis was rejected. We suggest that the effects of temperature on myofibril synthesis must occur downstream from MyHC transcription either at the level of translation or at the assembly stage.\n      "},{"title":"Swimming mechanics and behavior of the shallow-water brief squid Lolliguncula brevis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3655","abstract":"\n        Although squid are among the most versatile swimmers and rely on a unique locomotor system, little is known about the swimming mechanics and behavior of most squid, especially those that swim at low speeds in inshore waters. Shallow-water brief squid Lolliguncula brevis, ranging in size from 1.8 to 8.9 cm in dorsal mantle length (DML), were placed in flumes and videotaped, and the data were analyzed using motion-analysis equipment. Flow visualization and force measurement experiments were also performed in water tunnels. Mean critical swimming speeds (Ucrit) ranged from 15.3 to 22.8 cm s–1, and mean transition speeds (Ut; the speed above which squid swim exclusively in a tail-first orientation) varied from 9.0 to 15.3 cm s–1. At low speeds, negatively buoyant brief squid generated lift and/or improved stability by positioning the mantle and arms at high angles of attack, directing high-speed jets downwards (angles >50°) and using fin activity. To reduce drag at high speeds, the squid decreased angles of attack and swam tail-first. Fin motion, which could not be characterized exclusively as drag- or lift-based propulsion, was used over 50–95 % of the sustained speed range and provided as much as 83.8 % of the vertical and 55.1 % of the horizontal thrust. Small squid (<3.0 cm DML) used different swimming strategies from those of larger squid, possibly to maximize thrust benefits from vortex ring formation. Furthermore, brief squid employed various unsteady behaviors, such as manipulating funnel diameter during jetting, altering arm position and swimming in different orientations, to boost swimming performance. These results demonstrate that locomotion in slow-swimming squid is complex, involving intricate spatial and temporal interactions between the mantle, fins, arms and funnel.\n      "},{"title":"Aerobic respiratory costs of swimming in the negatively buoyant brief squid Lolliguncula brevis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3639","abstract":"\n        Because of the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion, squid are considered to be at a competitive disadvantage compared with fishes, which generally depend on forms of undulatory/oscillatory locomotion. Some squid, such as the brief squid Lolliguncula brevis, swim at low speeds in shallow-water complex environments, relying heavily on fin activity. Consequently, their swimming costs may be lower than those of the faster, more pelagic squid studied previously and competitive with those of ecologically relevant fishes. To examine aerobic respiratory swimming costs, O2 consumption rates were measured for L. brevis of various sizes (2–9 cm dorsal mantle length, DML) swimming over a range of speeds (3–30 cm s–1) in swim tunnel respirometers, while their behavior was videotaped. Using kinematic data from swimming squid and force data from models, power curves were also generated. Many squid demonstrated partial (J-shaped) or full (U-shaped) parabolic patterns of O2 consumption rate as a function of swimming speed, with O2 consumption minima at 0.5–1.5 DML s–1. Power curves derived from hydrodynamic data plotted as a function of swimming speed were also parabolic, with power minima at 1.2–1.7 DML s–1. The parabolic relationship between O2 consumption rate/power and speed, which is also found in aerial flyers such as birds, bats and insects but rarely in aquatic swimmers because of the difficulties associated with low-speed respirometry, is the result of the high cost of generating lift and maintaining stability at low speeds and overcoming drag at high speeds. L. brevis has a lower rate of O2 consumption than the squid Illex illecebrosus and Loligo opalescens studied in swim tunnel respirometers and is energetically competitive (especially at O2 consumption minima) with fishes, such as striped bass, mullet and flounder. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that, like aerial flyers, some negatively buoyant nekton have parabolic patterns of O2 consumption rate/power as a function of speed and that certain shallow-water squid using considerable fin activity have swimming costs that are competitive with those of ecologically relevant fishes.\n      "},{"title":"Encoding properties of the wing hinge stretch receptor in the hawkmoth Manduca sexta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3693","abstract":"\n        To characterize the in vivo responses of the wing hinge stretch receptor of Manduca sexta, I recorded its activity and simultaneously tracked the up-and-down motion of the wing while the hawkmoth flew tethered in a wind tunnel. The stretch receptor fires a high-frequency burst of spikes near each dorsal stroke reversal. The onset of the burst is tightly tuned to a set-point in wing elevation, and the number of spikes contained within the burst encodes the maximal degree of wing elevation during the stroke. In an effort to characterize its mechanical encoding properties, I constructed an actuator that delivered deformations to the wing hinge and simultaneously recorded the resultant stretch and tension and the activity of the stretch receptor. Stimuli included stepwise changes in length as well as more natural dynamic deformation that was measured in vivo. Step changes in length reveal that the stretch receptor encodes the static amplitude of stretch with both phasic and tonic firing dynamics. In vivo sinusoidal deformation revealed (i) that the timing of stretch receptor activity is tightly phase-locked within the oscillation cycle, (ii) that the number of spikes per burst is inversely related to oscillation frequency and (iii) that the instantaneous frequency of the burst increases with oscillation rate. At all oscillation rates tested, the instantaneous frequency of the burst increases with amplitude.\n      "},{"title":"Characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster alkali-metal/proton exchanger (NHE) gene family","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3703","abstract":"\n        The NHE family of Na+/H+ exchangers is believed to play an essential role in animals, but may play an additional, specialised epithelial role in insects.

Consistent with this, no degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) genes could be detected in Malpighian tubules by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using a low-stringency homology searching, three members of the NHE family were identified in the genomic sequence of Drosophila melanogaster, although only two genes were represented as expressed sequence tags. All three genes (DmNHE1 at cytological position 21B1, DmNHE2 at 39B1 and DmNHE3 at 27A1) were found by RT-PCR to be widely expressed, and one (DmNHE2) was shown to have multiple transcripts.

The stretch receptor fires a high-frequency burst of action potentials near the top of each wingstroke and encodes kinematic variables such as amplitude and timing. Here, I describe the effects of stretch receptor ablation on the visual control of lift during flight in the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. Using a combination of extracellular muscle recordings, force and position measurements and high-speed video recording, I tracked power muscle activity, net vertical flight force (lift), abdomen deflection and wing kinematics in response to image motions of varying velocity during tethered flight in a wind tunnel. As a result of bilateral ablation of the wing hinge stretch receptors, visually evoked lift decreased to nearly one-third of that exhibited by intact animals. The phase and frequency of indirect power muscle action potentials and the patterns of abdominal deflection were unaffected; however, wingstroke amplitude was clearly reduced after ablation. Collectively, these results suggest that stretch receptor feedback is integrated with descending visual cues to control wing kinematics and the resultant aerodynamic force production during flight.\n      "},{"title":"Localisation of intracellular calcium stores in the striated muscles of the jellyfish Polyorchis penicillatus: possible involvement in excitation–contraction coupling","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3727","abstract":"\n        When jellyfish striated muscles were stimulated directly, the amplitude of contractile tension increased as the stimulation frequency increased.

Calcium stores were identified ultrastructurally using enzymatic histochemistry to localize CaATPases, and potassium dichromate to precipitate calcium. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy was used to verify the presence of calcium in precipitates. Both CaATPase and calcium were localised in membrane-bound vesicles beneath the sarcolemma.

An alternative signal could be the vibrations of the comb at 200–300 Hz generated by dancing bees but which, without amplification, may not be large enough to alert remote dance-followers. We describe here, however, an unexpected property of honeycomb when it is subjected to vibration at around 200 Hz that would represent an effective amplification of the vibratory signals for remote dance-followers. We find that, at a specific distance from the origin of an imposed vibration, the walls across a single comb cell abruptly reverse the phase of their displacement and move in opposite directions to one another. Behavioural measurements show that the distance from which the majority of remote dance-followers are recruited coincides with the location of this phase-reversal phenomenon relative to the signal source. We propose that effective signal amplification by the phase-reversal phenomenon occurs when bees straddle a cell across which the phase reversal is expressed. Such a bee would be subjected to a situation in which the legs were moving towards and away from one another instead of in the same direction. In this manner, remote dance-followers could be alerted to a dancer performing in their vicinity.\n      "},{"title":"Intestinal iron uptake in the European flounder (Platichthys flesus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3779","abstract":"\n        Iron is an essential element because it is a key constituent of the metalloproteins involved in cellular respiration and oxygen transport.

This study assessed in vivo intestinal iron uptake and in vitro iron absorption in a marine teleost, the European flounder Platichthys flesus. Ferric iron, in the form 59FeCl3, was reduced to Fe2+ by ascorbate, and the bioavailability of Fe3+ and Fe2+ were compared. In vivo Fe2+ uptake was significantly greater than Fe3+ uptake and was reduced by the iron chelator desferrioxamine. Fe2+ was also more bioavailable than Fe3+ in in vitro studies that assessed the temporal pattern and concentration-dependency of iron absorption. The posterior region, when compared with the anterior and mid regions of the intestine, was the preferential site for Fe2+ uptake in vivo. In vitro iron absorption was upregulated in the posterior intestine in response to prior haemoglobin depletion of the fish, and the transport showed a Q10 value of 1.94. Iron absorption in the other segments of the intestine did not correlate with haematocrit, and Q10 values were lower. Manipulation of the luminal pH had no effect on in vitro iron absorption. The present study demonstrates that a marine teleost absorbs Fe2+ preferentially in the posterior intestine. This occurs in spite of extremely high luminal bicarbonate concentrations recorded in vivo, which may be expected to reduce the bioavailability of divalent cations as a result of the precipitation as carbonates (e.g. FeCO3).\n      "},{"title":"The energetics of rat papillary muscles undergoing realistic strain patterns","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3765","abstract":"\n        Studies of cardiac muscle energetics have traditionally used contraction protocols with strain patterns that bear little resemblance to those observed in vivo. This study aimed to develop a realistic strain protocol, based on published in situ measurements of contracting papillary muscles, for use with isolated preparations. The protocol included the three phases observed in intact papillary muscles: an initial isometric phase followed by isovelocity shortening and re-lengthening phases. Realistic papillary muscle dynamics were simulated in vitro (27°C) using preparations isolated from the left ventricle of adult male rats. The standard contraction protocol consisted of 40 twitches at a contraction rate of 2 Hz. Force, changes in muscle length and changes in muscle temperature were measured simultaneously. To quantify the energetic costs of contraction, work output and enthalpy output were determined, from which the maximum net mechanical efficiency could be calculated. The most notable result from these experiments was the constancy of enthalpy output per twitch, or energy cost, despite the various alterations made to the protocol. Changes in mechanical efficiency, therefore, generally reflected changes in work output per twitch. The variable that affected work output per twitch to the greatest extent was the amplitude of shortening, while changes in the duration of the initial isometric phase had little effect. Decreasing the duration of the shortening phase increased work output per twitch without altering enthalpy output per twitch. Increasing the contraction frequency from 2 to 3 Hz resulted in slight decreases in the work output per twitch and in efficiency. Using this realistic strain protocol, the maximum net mechanical efficiency of rat papillary muscles was approximately 15 %. The protocol was modified to incorporate an isometric relaxation period, thus allowing the model to simulate the main mechanical features of ventricular function.\n      "},{"title":"Nitric oxide induces centrally generated motor patterns in the locust suboesophageal ganglion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3789","abstract":"\n        The stimulatory effects of nitric oxide (NO) on central motor pattern generation in isolated locust suboesophageal ganglia (SOGs) were studied using extracellular recordings from motor nerves.

Experiments with muscarinic agonists and antagonists showed that the NO-induced motor pattern is generated independently from the motor pattern induced by muscarinic agonists described previously. Staining for NADPH-diaphorase and an antiserum directed against cyclic GMP were used to identify neurones representing potential sources of NO and their target cells within the SOG.

In addition, Hb-rich animals showed a significant decrease in the PO2amb at which the Hb in the heart region was half-saturated and a striking reduction in the critical PO2amb of appendage-related variables. In Hb-poor animals, the INADH signal indicated that the oxygen supply to the limb muscle tissue started to become impeded at a critical PO2amb of 4.75 kPa, although the high level of fa was largely maintained until 1.77 kPa. The obvious discrepancy between these two critical PO2amb values suggested an anaerobic supplementation of energy provision in the range 4.75–1.77 kPa. The fact that INADH of Hb-rich animals did not rise until PO2amb fell below 1.32 kPa strongly suggests that the extra Hb available to Hb-rich animals ensured an adequate oxygen supply to the limb muscle tissue in the PO2amb range 4.75–1.32 kPa. This finding illustrates the physiological benefit of Hb in enabling the animal to sustain its aerobic metabolism as the energetically most efficient mode of fuel utilization under conditions of reduced oxygen availability.\n      "},{"title":"Respiratory water loss in free-flying pigeons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3803","abstract":"\n        We assessed respiratory and cutaneous water loss in trained tippler pigeons (Columba livia) both at rest and in free flight. In resting pigeons, exhaled air temperature Tex increased with ambient air temperature Ta (Tex=16.3+0.705Ta) between 15°C and 30°C, while tidal volume VT (VT=4.7±1.0 ml, mean ± s.d. at standard temperature and pressure dry) and breathing frequency fR (fR=0.46±0.06 breaths s–1) were independent of Ta. Respiratory water loss, RWL, was constant over the range of Ta (RWL=1.2±0.4 mg g–1 h–1) used. In flying pigeons, Tex increased with Ta (Tex=25.8+0.34Ta), while fR was independent of Ta (fR=5.6±1.4 breaths s–1) between 8.8°C and 27°C. Breathing frequency varied intermittently between 2 and 8 breaths s–1 during flight and was not always synchronized with wing-beat frequency. RWL was independent of air temperature (RWL=9.2±2.9 mg g–1 h–1), but decreased with increasing inspired air water vapor density (ρin) (RWL=12.5–0.362ρin), whereas cutaneous water loss, CWL, increased with air temperature (CWL=10.122+0.898Ta), but was independent of ρin. RWL was 25.7–32.2 %, while CWL was 67.8–74.3 % of the total evaporative water loss. The data indicate that pigeons have more efficient countercurrent heat exchange in their anterior respiratory passages when at rest than in flight, allowing them to recover more water at rest at lower air temperatures. When evaporative water loss increases in flight, especially at high Ta, the major component is cutaneous rather than respiratory, possibly brought about by reducing the skin water vapor diffusion resistance. Because of the tight restrictions imposed by gas exchange in flight, the amount of water potentially lost through respiration is limited.\n      "},{"title":"Choreography of song, dance and beak movements in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/20/3497","abstract":"\n        As do many songbirds, zebra finches sing their learned songs while performing a courtship display that includes movements of the body, head and beak. The coordination of these display components was assessed by analyzing video recordings of courting males. All birds changed beak aperture frequently within a single song, and each individual’s pattern of beak movements was consistent from song to song. Birds that copied their father’s songs reproduced many of the changes in beak aperture associated with particular syllables. The acoustic consequences of opening the beak were increases in amplitude and peak frequency, but not in fundamental frequency, of song syllables. The change in peak frequency is consistent with the hypothesis that an open beak results in a shortened vocal tract and thus a higher resonance frequency. Dance movements (hops and changes in body or head position) were less frequent, and the distribution of dance movements within the song was not as strongly patterned as were changes in beak aperture, nor were the peaks in the distribution as strongly marked. However, the correlation between the positioning of dance movements within fathers’ and sons’ songs was striking, suggesting that the choreography of dance patterns is transmitted from tutor to pupil together with the song.\n      A QuickTime movie of a courtship display used in this study can be found at: http://www.williams.edu/Biology/ZFinch/zfdance.html."},{"title":"Dual ecdysteroid action on the epitracheal glands and central nervous system preceding ecdysis of Manduca sexta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/20/3483","abstract":"\n        Initiation of the ecdysis behavioural sequence in insects requires activation of the central nervous system (CNS) by pre-ecdysis-triggering hormone (PETH) and ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH), which are released from the Inka cells of the epitracheal glands. Here, we show that the developmental events preceding larval and pupal ecdysis of Manduca sexta involve a dual action of ecdysteroids on the epitracheal glands and CNS. The low steroid levels in freshly ecdysed and feeding larvae are associated with small-sized epitracheal glands, reduced peptide production in Inka cells and insensitivity of the CNS to ETH. The elevated ecdysteroid levels before each ecdysis lead to a dramatic enlargement of Inka cells and increased production of peptide hormones and their precursors. As blood ecdysteroids reach peak levels, the CNS becomes responsive to Inka cell peptides. These effects of natural ecdysteroid pulses can be experimentally induced by injection of 20-hydroxyecdysone or the ecdysteroid agonist tebufenozide (RH-5992) into ecdysed larvae, thus stimulating peptide production in Inka cells and inducing CNS sensitivity to ETH. A direct steroid action on the CNS is demonstrated by subsequent treatment of isolated nerve cords from ecdysed larvae with 20-hydroxyecdysone and ETH, which results in pre-ecdysis or ecdysis bursts. Our data show that ecdysteroid-induced transcriptional activity in both the epitracheal glands and the CNS are necessary events for the initiation of the ecdysis behavioural sequence.\n      "},{"title":"Maturation of muscle properties and its hormonal control in an adult insect","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/20/3531","abstract":"\n        The oviposition of female locusts requires longitudinal muscles to tolerate remarkable lengthening. Whether this ability together with concomitant properties develops during maturation or is present throughout life was investigated. The properties of the locust abdominal muscles involved in oviposition behaviour were investigated with respect to their maturation, segment- and gender-specificity and regulation by juvenile hormone (JH). Muscles from the sixth abdominal segment (an oviposition segment) of mature females (>18 days old) were able to tolerate large extensions (>8 mm). At this length, muscles were still able to generate considerable neurally evoked twitch tension. In contrast, muscle fibres from females less than 5 days old did not tolerate extension of more than 4 mm. At this length, tension generation was negligible. The maximum tension generated at different stimulus frequencies was significantly higher in muscles of females more than 18 days old than in females less than 5 days old. Furthermore, the cross-sectional area of muscle fibres increased significantly during reproductive development. Current-clamp recordings from denervated muscle fibres of females more than 18 days old revealed their ability to generate overshooting action potentials. The potentials were tetrodotoxin (TTX)-insensitive (0.5 μmol l–1 TTX), but were blocked by Cd2+ (50 μmol l–1) or nifedipine (50 μmol l–1), which suggests the involvement of L-type Ca2+ channels. Action potentials recorded from females less than 5 days old differed considerably in amplitude and shape from those recorded from females more than 18 days old, suggesting their maturation during the first 2 weeks of adult life. Inactivation of the corpora allata (CA) by precocene inhibited the maturation of these muscle properties, whereas injection of JH into precocene-treated females reversed this effect. Homologous muscles from the third abdominal segment (a non-oviposition segment, M169) and muscles from males (M214) revealed no comparable changes, although some minor changes occurred during reproductive development. The results suggest a gender- and segment-specific maturation of muscle properties that is related to reproductive behaviour and controlled by JH.\n      "},{"title":"Slow ATP loss and the defense of ion homeostasis in the anoxic frog brain","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/20/3547","abstract":"\n        For most vertebrates, cutting off the oxygen supply to the brain results in a rapid (within minutes) loss of ATP, the failure of ATP-dependent ion-transport process, subsequent anoxic depolarization of neuronal membrane potential and consequential neuronal death. The few species that survive brain anoxia for days or months, such as the freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta, avoid anoxic depolarization and maintain brain ATP levels through a coordinated downregulation of brain energy demand processes. The frog Rana pipiens represents an intermediate in anoxia-tolerance, being able to survive brain anoxia for hours. However, the anoxic frog brain does not defend its energy stores. Instead, anoxia-tolerance appears to be related to a retarded rate of ATP depletion. To investigate the relationship between this slow ATP depletion and the loss of ionic homeostasis, cerebral extracellular K+ concentrations were monitored and ATP levels measured during anoxia, during the initial phase of anoxic depolarization and during complete anoxic depolarization. Extracellular K+ levels were maintained at normoxic levels for at least 3 h of anoxia, while ATP content decreased by 35 %. When ATP levels reached 0.33±0.06 mmol l–1 (mean ± s.e.m., N=5), extracellular K+ levels slowly started to increase. This value is thought to represent a critical ATP concentration for the maintenance of ion homeostasis. When extracellular [K+] reached an inflection value of 4.77±0.84 mmol l–1 (mean ± s.e.m., N=5), approximately 1 h later, the brain quickly depolarized. Part of the reduction in ATP demand was attributable to an approximately 50 % decrease in the rate of K+ efflux from the anoxic frog brain, which would also contribute to the retarded rate of increase in extracellular [K+] during the initial phase of anoxic depolarization. However, unlike the anoxia-tolerant turtle brain, adenosine did not appear to be involved in the downregulation of K+ leakage in the frog brain. The increased anoxia-tolerance of the frog brain is thought to be a matter more of slow death than of enhanced protective mechanisms.\n      "},{"title":"The effects of speed on the in vivo activity and length of a limb muscle during the locomotion of the iguanian lizard Dipsosaurus dorsalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/20/3507","abstract":"\n        The caudofemoralis muscle is the largest muscle that inserts onto the hindlimb of most ectothermic tetrapods, and previous studies hypothesize that it causes several movements that characterize the locomotion of vertebrates with a sprawling limb posture. Predicting caudofemoralis function is complicated because the muscle spans multiple joints with movements that vary with speed. Furthermore, depending on when any muscle is active relative to its change in length, its function can change from actively generating mechanical work to absorbing externally applied forces. We used synchronized electromyography, sonomicrometry and three-dimensional kinematics to determine in vivo caudofemoralis function in the desert iguana Dipsosaurus dorsalis for a wide range of speeds of locomotion from a walk to nearly maximal sprinting (50–350 cm s–1). Strain of the caudofemoralis increased with increasing tail elevation and long-axis rotation and protraction of the femur. However, knee extension only increased caudofemoralis strain when the femur was protracted. The maximum and minimum length of the caudofemoralis muscle and its average shortening velocity increased from the slowest speed up to the walk–run transition, but changed little with further increases in speed. The times of muscle shortening and lengthening were often not equal at higher locomotor speeds. Some (20–25 ms) activity occurred during lengthening of the caudofemoralis muscle before footfall. However, most caudofemoralis activity was consistent with performing positive mechanical work to flex the knee shortly after foot contact and to retract and rotate the femur throughout the propulsive phase.\n      "},{"title":"Caudal differential pressure as a predictor of swimming speed of cod (Gadus morhua)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/20/3561","abstract":"\n        We report the results of an experiment designed to investigate the feasibility of using differential pressure to estimate the swimming speed and metabolic rate of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Seven cod were fitted with a miniature differential pressure sensor mounted on one side of the caudal peduncle immediately anterior to the base of the caudal fin rays. Relationships between differential pressure, tailbeat frequency, tailbeat amplitude, swimming speed and rate of oxygen consumption (ṀO2) were determined as a function of the swimming speed of cod swimming at 5°C in a recirculating ‘Brett-style’ respirometer. Tailbeat differential pressure, tailbeat amplitude and tailbeat frequency were highly correlated with swimming speed. The average or integrated pressure ranged from 0 to 150 Pa for speeds up to 0.8 m s–1 (1.1 L s–1, where L is total body length), while the ‘pressure difference’ (maximum minus minimum pressure) ranged from 0 to 900 Pa. Small changes in swimming speed of less than 0.05 m s–1 were readily detected as differences in tailbeat pressure. Burst swimming in the respirometer resulted in huge pressure ‘bursts’ of up to 5000 Pa ‘pressure difference’.\n      \n        The rate of oxygen consumption increased exponentially and was highly correlated with swimming speed (r2=0.77). The rate of oxygen consumption was also correlated with tailbeat integrated pressure (r2=0.68) and with differential pressure (r2=0.43); regression correlations were always greater for individuals than for combined data from all cod.\n      \n        The results detailed in this study indicate that an ultrasonic differential pressure transmitter would enable accurate estimates of the swimming speed, rates of oxygen consumption and activity patterns of free-ranging fish in nature.\n      "},{"title":"Autonomic control of heart rate during forced activity and digestion in the snake Boa constrictor","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/20/3553","abstract":"\n        Reptiles, particularly snakes, exhibit large and quantitatively similar increments in metabolic rate during muscular exercise and following a meal, when they are apparently inactive.

The snakes were equipped with an arterial catheter for measurements of blood pressure and heart rate, and autonomic tonus was determined following infusion of the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (3 mg kg–1) and the muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonist atropine (3 mg kg–1).\n      \n        The mean heart rate of fasting animals at rest was 26.4±1.4 min–1, and this increased to 36.1±1.4 min–1 (means ± s.e.m.; N=8) following double autonomic block (atropine and propranolol). The calculated cholinergic and adrenergic tones were 60.1±9.3 % and 19.8±2.2 %, respectively. Heart rate increased to 61.4±1.5 min–1 during enforced activity, and this response was significantly reduced by propranolol (maximum values of 35.8±1.6 min–1), but unaffected by atropine.

Double autonomic block virtually abolished tachycardia associated with enforced activity (heart rate increased significantly from 36.1±1.4 to 37.6±1.3 min–1), indicating that non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic effectors are not involved in regulating heart rate during activity. Blood pressure also increased during activity.\n      \n        Digestion was accompanied by an increase in heart rate from 25.6±1.3 to 47.7±2.2 min–1 (N=8).

The heart rate of digesting snakes was 47.0±1.0 min–1 after double autonomic blockade, which is significantly higher than the value of 36.1±1.4 min–1 in double-blocked fasting animals at rest. Therefore, it appears that some other factor exerts a positive chronotropic effect during digestion, and we propose that this factor may be a circulating regulatory peptide, possibly liberated from the gastrointestinal system in response to the presence of food.\n      "},{"title":"Adjusting the thermostat: the threshold induction temperature for the heat-shock response in intertidal mussels (genus Mytilus) changes as a function of thermal history","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/20/3571","abstract":"\n        Spatio-temporal variation in heat-shock gene expression gives organisms the ability to respond to changing thermal environments.

To elucidate the mechanism by which this plasticity in gene expression is achieved, we determined heat-shock protein (Hsp) induction threshold temperatures in the intertidal mussel Mytilus trossulus collected from the field in February and again in August. In a separate experiment, threshold induction temperatures, endogenous levels of both the constitutive and inducible isoforms of Hsps from the 70 kDa family and the quantity of ubiquitinated proteins (a measure of cellular protein denaturation) were measured in M. trossulus after either 6 weeks of cold acclimation in the laboratory or acclimatization to warm, summer temperatures in the field over the same period. In addition, we quantified levels of activated heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) in both groups of mussels (HSF1 inducibly transactivates all classes of Hsp genes). Lastly, we compared the temperature of HSF1 activation with the induction threshold temperature in the congeneric M. californianus. It was found that the threshold induction temperature in M. trossulus was 23°C in February and 28°C in August. This agreed with the acclimation/acclimatization experiment, in which mussels acclimated in seawater tables to a constant temperature of 10–11°C for 6 weeks displayed a threshold induction temperature of 20–23°C compared with 26–29°C for individuals that were experiencing considerably warmer body temperatures in the intertidal zone over the same period. This coincided with a significant increase in the inducible isoform of Hsp70 in warm-acclimatized individuals but no increase in the constitutive isoform or in HSF1. Levels of ubiquitin-conjugated protein were significantly higher in the field mussels than in the laboratory-acclimated individuals. Finally, the temperature of HSF1 activation in M. californianus was found to be approximately 9°C lower than the induction threshold for this species.\n      "},{"title":"The influence of locomotion on air-sac pressures in little penguins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/20/3581","abstract":"\n        Air-sac pressures have been reported to oscillate with wing beat in flying magpies and with foot paddling in diving ducks.

Fluctuations averaged 0.16±0.06 kPa in the interclavicular air sacs, but only 0.06±0.04 kPa in the posterior thoracic sac, generating a small differential pressure between sacs of 0.06±0.02 kPa (means ± s.e.m., N=4). These fluctuations occurred at approximately 3 Hz and corresponded to wing beats during swimming, indicated by electromyograms from the pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles. There was no abdominal muscle activity associated with swimming or exhalation, but the abdominal muscles were active with the step cycle in walking penguins, and oscillations in posterior air-sac pressure (0.08±0.038 kPa) occurred with steps.

Dye-fills of axons revealed four types of thoracic stretch receptor (TSR): an N-cell type (TSR-1), a differentiated N-cell type (TSR-2), a muscle receptor organ (MRO)-type with a long, single receptor muscle (TSR-3) and an MRO-type with a short, single receptor muscle (TSR-4 to TSR-7).\n      \n        Physiologically, TSR-1 and TSR-2 are tonic-type stretch receptors.

Both TSR-2, with a long muscle strand, and TSR-3, with a single, long receptor muscle, have a wide dynamic range in their stretch-activated response. In addition, TSR-2 is controlled by an intersegmental inhibitory reflex from TSR-3. These results suggest that, although TSR-1 has no receptor muscle and TSR-2 has a less-differentiated receptor-like muscle, they are fully functional position detectors of segmental movements, as are the MRO-type receptors TSR-3 to TSR-7.\n      "},{"title":"Alternative splicing, muscle contraction and intraspecific variation: associations between troponin T transcripts, Ca2+ sensitivity and the force and power output of dragonfly flight muscles during oscillatory contraction","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/20/3457","abstract":"\n        The flight muscles of Libellula pulchella dragonflies contain a mixture of six alternatively spliced transcripts of a single troponin T (TnT) gene.

The relative abundance of one TnT transcript, or the pooled relative abundance of two TnT transcripts, showed a positive correlation with a 10-fold range of variation in Ca2+ sensitivity of skinned fibers (r2=0.77, P<0.0001) and a threefold range in peak specific force (r2=0.74, P<0.0001), specific work per cycle (r2=0.54; P<0.0001) and maximum specific power output (r2=0.48, P=0.0005) of intact muscle. Using these results to reanalyze previously published data for wing kinematics during free flight, we show that the relative abundances of these particular transcripts are also positively correlated with wingbeat frequency and amplitude. TnT variation alone may be responsible for these effects, or TnT variation may be a marker for changes in a suite of co-regulated molecules. Dragonflies from two ponds separated by 16 km differed significantly in both TnT transcript composition and muscle contractile performance, and within each population there are two distinct morphs that showed different maturational trajectories of TnT transcript composition and muscle contractility. Thus, there is broad intraspecific variability and a high degree of population structure for contractile performance phenotypes, TnT ribotypes and ontogenetic patterns involving these traits that affect locomotor performance.\n      "},{"title":"Cellular mechanisms underlying temperature-induced bleaching in the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/20/3443","abstract":"\n        Temperature-induced bleaching in symbiotic cnidarians is a result of the detachment and loss of host cells containing symbiotic algae.

Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of plasma membranes from the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and the Hawaiian coral Pocillopora damicornis labeled with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) revealed no membrane thermotropic event. In addition, intracellular imaging using Fura-2AM as well as labeling anemones with 45Ca revealed no significant change in [Ca2+]i. However, bleaching could be evoked at ambient temperature with 25 mmol l–1 caffeine without affecting [Ca2+]i. [Ca2+]i could be altered with ionomycin in isolated host cells, but ionomycin could not induce bleaching in A. pulchella. As caffeine can affect levels of intracellular protein phosphorylation, the ability of other agents that alter intracellular levels of protein phosphorylation to evoke bleaching was investigated. The protein phosphatase inhibitor vanadate could induce bleaching in A. pulchella. Two-dimensional gels of 32P-labeled proteins from cold-shocked, caffeine-treated and control anemones show that both temperature shock and caffeine alter the array of phosphorylated host soluble proteins.

If the mass of the distal part of the leg is halved, then the extension is complete in less than 1 ms with angular velocities of more than 200° ms–1. The high velocities and the associated power are generated by a preceding storage of energy and its sudden release produced by a specific motor pattern and specialisations of the femoro-tibial joints. To understand the dynamics of these rapid movements and the interrelations between joint mechanics and the motor pattern, kicks were analysed with high-speed video images coupled to simultaneous intracellular recordings from identified leg motor neurones. The first movement is a full tibial flexion followed by co-contraction of the extensor and flexor tibiae muscles for 0.3–1 s, during which the distal end of the femur is flattened dorso-ventrally and expanded laterally. The two semi-lunar processes on the distal femur are bent when the fast extensor tibiae motor neurone spikes so that their tips move ventrally by up to 0.6 mm. The inward projections of these processes into the femur form the proximal part of the hinge joint with the tibia, so that the pivot of the joint also changes and the tibia therefore moves proximally and ventrally, widening the gap between it and the femur. Extension of the tibia begins on average 34 ms after the flexor motor neurones are inhibited at the end of the co-contraction phase. The tibia then begins to extend slowly, reaching peak velocities only when it has extended by 60–70°. The semi-lunar processes do not start to unfurl until the tibia has extended by 55°, so they cannot provide the initial energy for extension. An audible click is produced when the semi-lunar processes unfurl. The peak velocity of tibial extension is correlated with the amount of bending of the semi-lunar processes and with the number of fast extensor motor spikes, but the same amount of semi-lunar bending can be produced by both short and long co-contractions. When the tibia reaches full extension, inertial forces may cause it to bend by as much as 33° at a plane of weakness in the proximal tibia, thus allowing further extension of the distal end.\n      "},{"title":"Two myostatin genes are differentially expressed in myotomal muscles of the trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/20/3523","abstract":"\n        Myostatin (GDF8) has been shown to be a major genetic determinant of skeletal muscle growth in mammals.

The presence in this fish species of two myostatin genes (Tmyostatin 1 and Tmyostatin 2) probably results from the recent tetraploïdisation of the salmonid genome. A comparative reverse-transcriptase-linked polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that Tmyostatin 1 mRNA was present ubiquitously in trout tissues, while Tmyostatin 2 mRNA expression was restricted to muscle and brain. In developing muscle, Tmyostatin 1 expression was observed in eyed-stage embryos well before hatching, whereas Tmyostatin 2 was expressed only in free-swimming larvae. In myotomal muscle from adult animals, Tmyostatin 1 mRNA accumulation was similar in both slow- and fast-twitch fibres, and its concentration did not change during the muscle wasting associated with sexual maturation. In contrast, Tmyostatin 2 mRNA accumulated predominantly in slow-twitch fibres, and its concentration decreased dramatically in wasting muscles from maturing animals. This work shows that two distinct myostatin genes are present in the trout genome. Furthermore, it indicates that these two trout myostatin genes (i) exhibit a distinct expression pattern in muscle and non-muscle tissues and (ii) are not upregulated during the muscle wasting that accompanies sexual maturation.\n      "},{"title":"Molecular cloning and characterisation of a novel membrane receptor gene from the lobster Jasus edwardsii","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/19/3369","abstract":"\n        The eyestalk of the lobster, Jasus edwardsii, is an important source for hormones involved in the regulation of growth and reproduction.

These genes, peJK2 and peJK3, were isolated from a cDNA library derived from lobster eyestalk mRNAs. The two clones shared 96.6 % sequence homology, and code for putative proteins of 110 and 113 amino acids, respectively. These were likely to be two allelic forms of the same gene. Northern blot analysis using these clones as probes detected the same mRNA from eyestalk, muscle and epithelial extracts, but with greater intensity in the eyestalk extract. In situ hybridisation also indicated the predominant expression of these genes in the eyestalk. Analysis of the putative protein sequences showed that they contained two transmembrane (TM) helices, a short amino acid sequence sharing high homology with the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) motif in the second TM, a signal sequence between the TMs, and a protein kinase phosphorylation site at the C termini.

This long-term adaptation process is selective, however, permitting insects to adapt physiologically to some but not all noxious foods. We hypothesized (i) that the selective nature of this adaptation process stems from the fact that some unpalatable foods are toxic while others are harmless and (ii) that insects have more difficulty adapting to foods that are both unpalatable and toxic. Our model system consisted of Manduca sexta caterpillars and two compounds that taste bitter to humans and elicit an aversive behavioral response in this insect (salicin and aristolochic acid). We found that 2 days of exposure to a salicin diet completely adapted the aversive response of the caterpillars to salicin, but that exposure to an aristolochic acid diet failed to adapt the aversive response to aristolochic acid. We determined that M. sexta could not adapt to the aristolochic acid diet because it lacked mechanisms for reducing the compound’s toxicity. In contrast, the salicin diet did not produce any apparent toxic effects, and the caterpillars adapted to its aversive taste within 12 h of exposure. We also found that the salicin adaptation phenomenon (i) was mediated by the central gustatory system, (ii) generalized to salicin concentrations that were twice those in the adapting diet and (iii) offset spontaneously when the caterpillar was transferred to a salicin-free diet. We propose that toxicity is a more significant barrier to dietary adaptation than ‘bitterness’ in this insect.\n      "},{"title":"Comparative kinematics of the forelimb during swimming in red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta) and spiny softshell (Apalone spinifera) turtles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/19/3261","abstract":"\n        Softshell turtles (Family Trionychidae) possess extensive webbing between the digits of the manus, suggesting that the forelimb may serve as an effective thrust generator during aquatic locomotion. However, the hindlimb has previously been viewed as the dominant propulsive organ in swimming freshwater turtles. To evaluate the potential role of the forelimb in thrust production during swimming in freshwater turtles, we compared the forelimb morphology and three-dimensional forelimb kinematics of a highly aquatic trionychid turtle, the spiny softshell Apalone spinifera, and a morphologically generalized emydid turtle, the red-eared slider Trachemys scripta. Spiny softshells possess nearly twice as much forelimb surface area as sliders for generating drag-based thrust. In addition, although both species use drag-based propulsion, several aspects of forelimb kinematics differ significantly between these species. During the thrust phase of the forelimb cycle, spiny softshells hold the elbow and wrist joints significantly straighter than sliders, thereby further increasing the surface area of the limb that can move water posteriorly and increasing the velocity of the distal portion of the forelimb. These aspects of swimming kinematics in softshells should increase forelimb thrust production and suggest that the forelimbs make more substantial contributions to forward thrust in softshell turtles than in sliders. Spiny softshells also restrict forelimb movements to a much narrower dorsoventral and anteroposterior range than sliders throughout the stroke, thereby helping to minimize limb movements potentially extraneous to forward thrust production. These comparisons demonstrate considerable diversity in the forelimb kinematics of turtles that swim using rowing motions of the limbs and suggest that the evolution of turtle forelimb mechanics produced a variety of contrasting solutions for aquatic specialization.\n      "},{"title":"Spread of synaptic potentials through electrical synapses in Retzius neurones of the leech","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/19/3241","abstract":"\n        We studied the spread of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) through electrical synapses in Retzius neurones of the leech Haementeria officinalis. The pair of Retzius neurones in each ganglion is coupled by a non-rectifying electrical synapse. Both neurones displayed synchronous EPSPs of varying amplitudes and rise times. The kinetics of synchronous EPSPs was similar in 79 % of the EPSP pairs. In the remaining 21 %, one EPSP was smaller and slower than the other, suggesting its passive spread from the other neurone. The proportion of these events increased to 75 % in the presence of Mg2+ in the bathing fluid. This spread of EPSPs from one neurone to another was tested by producing artificial EPSPs by current injection into the soma of one Retzius neurone. The artificial EPSPs were smaller and arrived more slowly at the soma of the coupled neurone. The coupling ratios for the EPSPs were proportional to the coupling ratio for long steady-state pulses in different neuronal pairs. Our results showed that EPSPs spread from one Retzius neurone to the other and support the idea that EPSP spread between electrically coupled neurones may contribute to the integration processes of neurones.\n      "},{"title":"Immunochemical analysis of the vacuolar proton-ATPase B-subunit in the gills of a euryhaline stingray (Dasyatis sabina): effects of salinity and relation to Na+/K+-ATPase","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/19/3251","abstract":"\n        In the gills of freshwater teleost fishes, vacuolar proton-ATPase (V-H+-ATPase) is found on the apical membrane of pavement and chloride (Na+/K+-ATPase-rich) cells, and is an important transporter for energizing Na+ uptake and H+ excretion. In the gills of elasmobranch fishes, the V-H+-ATPase has not been extensively studied and its expression in freshwater individuals has not been examined. The goals of this study were to examine the effects of environmental salinity on the expression of V-H+-ATPase in the gills of an elasmobranch (the Atlantic stingray, Dasyatis sabina) and determine if V-H+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase are expressed in the same cells. We found that gills from freshwater stingrays had the highest relative abundance of V-H+-ATPase and greatest number of V-H+-ATPase-rich cells, using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. When freshwater animals were acclimated to sea water for 1 week, V-H+-ATPase abundance and the number of V-H+-ATPase-rich cells decreased significantly. Atlantic stingrays from seawater environments were characterized by the lowest expression of V-H+-ATPase and least number of V-H+-ATPase-rich cells. In contrast to teleost fishes, localization of V-H+-ATPase in freshwater stingray gills was not found in pavement cells and occurred on the basolateral membrane in cells that are presumably rich in mitochondria. In freshwater stingrays acclimated to sea water and seawater stingrays, V-H+-ATPase localization appeared qualitatively to be stronger in the cytoplasm, which may suggest the transporter was stored in vesicles. Using a double-immunolabeling technique, we found that V-H+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase occurred in distinct cells, which suggests there may be two types of mitochondrion-rich cells in the elasmobranch gill epithelium. Based on these findings, we propose a unique model of NaCl and acid–base regulation where the V-H+-ATPase-rich cells and Na+/K+-ATPase-rich cells are the sites of Cl– uptake/HCO3– excretion and Na+ uptake/H+ excretion, respectively.\n      "},{"title":"Standard metabolic rate at the surface and during trained submersions in adult California sea lions (Zalophus californianus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/19/3273","abstract":"\n        The metabolic rate (MR) of four adult California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), two males and two females, was quantified during trained submersion and stationing behavior in laboratory tanks. MR was measured, at rest and for single submersions of increasing duration (1–7 min), by measuring oxygen consumption using open-circuit, indirect calorimetry. Standard MR was measured under conditions defined for basal MR and was found to be 1.9 to 3 times that predicted for terrestrial animals of similar size. Submersion MRs were calculated from the post-submersion oxygen debt and declined to as little as 47 % of standard MR on the longest submersions. This hypometabolic response was proportional to the duration of submersion and was greatest for the maximum duration submersions. Short submersions produced MRs equivalent to measured standard MR. These data suggest that although California sea lions maintain an elevated metabolism under standard conditions, they are capable of reducing their metabolism in response to the needs of diving. Such metabolic flexibility enables sea lions to moderate their oxygen use during diving and to extend their aerobic diving capability.\n      "},{"title":"Speeds and wingbeat frequencies of migrating birds compared with calculated benchmarks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/19/3283","abstract":"\n        Sixteen species of birds passing Falsterbo in southwest Sweden during the autumn migration season were observed using short-range optical methods. Air speeds and wingbeat frequencies were measured, reduced to sea level, and compared with benchmark values computed by Flight.bas, a published flight performance program based on flight mechanics. The benchmark for air speed was the calculated sea-level value of the minimum power speed (Vmp). The mean speeds of three raptor species that flew by flap-gliding were below Vmp, apparently because the flap-glide cycle involved slowing down below Vmp when gliding and accelerating back up to Vmp when flapping. The mean speeds of 11 species that flew by continuous flapping were between 0.82Vmp and 1.27Vmp. Two passerine species that flew by bounding had mean speeds of 1.70Vmp and 1.96Vmp, but these high mean speeds reflected their ability to fly faster against head winds. These results do not support predictions from optimal migration theory, which suggest that migrating birds ‘should’ fly faster, relative to Vmp. However, observations were restricted for technical reasons to birds flying below 200 m and may not represent birds that were seriously committed to long-distance migration.The benchmark wingbeat frequency (fref) was derived from dimensional reasoning, not from statistical analysis of observations. Observed wingbeat frequencies ranged from 0.81fref to 1.05fref, except in the two bounding species, whose wingbeat frequencies appeared anomalously high. However, the mechanics of bounding with a power fraction q imply that gravity during the flapping phase is increased by a factor 1/q, and when the value of gravity was so adjusted in the expression for fref, the wingbeat frequencies of the two bounding species were predicted correctly as a function of the power fraction. In small birds with more muscle power than is required to fly at speeds near Vmp, bounding is an effective method of adjusting the specific work in the muscle fibres, allowing conversion efficiency to be maximised over a wide range of speeds.\n      "},{"title":"Light-dependent magnetoreception in birds: the behaviour of European robins, Erithacus rubecula, under monochromatic light of various wavelengths and intensities","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/19/3295","abstract":"\n        To investigate how magnetoreception is affected by the wavelength and intensity of light, we tested European robins, Erithacus rubecula, under monochromatic lights of various wavelengths at two intensities using oriented behaviour as an indicator of whether the birds could derive directional information from the geomagnetic field. At a quantal flux of 7×1015 quanta s–1 m–2, the birds were well oriented in their migratory direction east of North under 424 nm blue, 510 nm turquoise and 565 nm green light, whereas they were disoriented under 590 nm yellow light. Increasing the intensity of light at the same wavelengths more than sixfold to 43×1015 quanta s–1 m–2 resulted in a change in behaviour: under bright blue and green light, the birds now showed a preference for the East–West axis, with the majority of headings at the western end; under bright turquoise light, they oriented unimodally towards a direction slightly west of North. Under bright yellow light, the birds continued to be disoriented.\n      \n        These findings suggest a rather complex relationship between the receptors involved in magnetoreception. Magnetoreception appears to follow rules that are different from those of vision, suggesting that light-dependent magnetoreception may involve receptors and neuronal pathways of its own.\n      "},{"title":"Metabolic power, mechanical power and efficiency during wind tunnel flight by the European starling Sturnus vulgaris","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/19/3311","abstract":"\n        We trained two starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to fly in a wind tunnel whilst wearing respirometry masks. We measured the metabolic power (Pmet) from the rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production and calculated the mechanical power (Pmech) from two aerodynamic models using wingbeat kinematics measured by high-speed cinematography. Pmet increased from 10.4 to 14.9 W as flight speed was increased from 6.3 to 14.4 m s–1 and was compatible with the U-shaped power/speed curve predicted by the aerodynamic models. Flight muscle efficiency varied between 0.13 and 0.23 depending upon the bird, the flight speed and the aerodynamic model used to calculate Pmech. Pmet during flight is often estimated by extrapolation from the mechanical power predicted by aerodynamic models by dividing Pmech by a flight muscle efficiency of 0.23 and adding the costs of basal metabolism, circulation and respiration. This method would underestimate measured Pmet by 15–25 % in our birds. The mean discrepancy between measured and predicted Pmet could be reduced to 0.1±1.5 % if flight muscle efficiency was altered to a value of 0.18. A flight muscle efficiency of 0.18 rather than 0.23 should be used to calculate the flight costs of birds in the size range of starlings (approximately 0.1 kg) if Pmet is calculated from Pmech derived from aerodynamic models.\n      "},{"title":"Water acquisition and partitioning in Drosophila melanogaster: effects of selection for desiccation-resistance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/19/3323","abstract":"\n        We examined physiological features related to water balance in five replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have undergone selection for enhanced resistance to desiccation (D populations) and in five replicate control (C) populations. Adult D flies contain 34 % more water than the control flies. We examined two hypotheses for increased water acquisition in the D flies: (i) that they accumulate more water early in development and (ii) that they have a reduced post-eclosion diuretic water loss. We found no evidence of differential water or dry mass acquisition between the C and D populations prior to adulthood. We also found no evidence of differential post-eclosion diuresis, i.e. both C and D groups showed insignificant changes in water volume in the 4 h period immediately after eclosion. In addition, we quantified water content in the intra- and extracellular compartments of the C and D populations and were able to identify the hemolymph as the primary storage site of the ‘extra’ water carried by the desiccation-resistant flies. We estimated that 68 % of the increased water volume observed in the D flies was contained in the hemolymph. Desiccation-resistance was strongly correlated with hemolymph volume and only weakly with intracellular water volume. Survival during desiccation was also strongly related to the carbohydrate content of the D flies. It has been presumed that the D flies accumulate carbohydrate primarily as intracellular glycogen, which would result in a significant increase in intracellular water volume. We found that carbohydrate content was weakly correlated with intracellular water volume and more strongly with hemolymph volume. The carbohydrate pool in the D flies may, therefore, be contained in the extracellular compartment as well as in cells. These results are suggestive of the importance of modifications in hemolymph volume and hemolymph solute concentrations in the evolution of enhanced desiccation-tolerance in populations of Drosophila melanogaster.\n      "},{"title":"Localization of the clock controlling circadian rhythms in the first neuropile of the optic lobe in the housefly","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/19/3303","abstract":"\n        The visual system of a fly expresses several circadian rhythms that have been detected in the photoreceptors of the compound eye and in the first neuropile, the lamina, of the underlying optic lobe. In the lamina, axons of two classes of interneuron, L1 and L2, exhibit cyclical size changes, swelling by day and shrinking by night. These rhythmic size changes may be generated by circadian oscillators located inside and/or outside the optic lobe. To localize such oscillators, we have examined changes in the axonal cross-sectional areas of L1 and L2 within the lamina of the housefly (Musca domestica) under conditions of 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness (LD12:12), constant darkness (DD) or continuous light (LL) 24 h after the medulla was severed from the rest of the brain. After the lesion, the axon size changes of L1 and L2 were maintained only in LD conditions, but were weaker than in control flies. In DD and LL conditions, they were eliminated. This indicates that circadian rhythms in the lamina of a fly are generated central to the lamina and medulla neuropiles of the optic lobe. Cyclical changes of light and darkness in LD conditions are still able, however, to induce a weak daily rhythm in the axon sizes of L1 and L2.\n      "},{"title":"The molecular basis for spectral tuning of rod visual pigments in deep-sea fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/19/3333","abstract":"\n        Most species of deep-sea fish possess of a rod-only retina with a pigment that is generally shortwave shifted in λmax towards the blue region of the spectrum.

In this study, the rod opsin gene sequences from 28 deep-sea fish species drawn from seven different Orders are compared. The λmax values of the rod pigments vary from approximately 520 nm to <470 nm, with the majority lying between 490 nm and 477 nm. The 520 nm pigment in two species of dragon fish is associated with a Phe261Tyr substitution, whereas the shortwave shifts of the pigments in the other 26 species are accountable by substitutions at a further eight sites (83, 122, 124, 132, 208, 292, 299 and 300). Clustering of λmax values does not, however, involve a common subset of these substitutions in the different species. A phylogenetic analysis predicts that the pigment in the ancestral species would have had a λmax of approximately 480 nm.

When the euryhaline osmoconformer C. tarsalis was acutely transferred from 30 % to 50 % sea water, the patterns of hemolymph Na+ and Cl– regulation were similar. The underlying regulatory mechanisms for these two ions have very different characteristics. In C. tarsalis, Na+ efflux was significantly elevated compared with the rates measured in the freshwater-restricted C. quinquefasciatus, while Cl– influx was relatively lower. The modulation of Na+ efflux and Cl– influx allowed C. tarsalis to avoid a potential salt load and ionic disturbance in the hemolymph during an acute increase  in salinity. The observed adjustment of NaCl regulation departs from that determined for other euryhaline organisms and is integral to the osmoconforming response. At the other extreme of the salinity spectrum, we observed that C. tarsalis faces difficulties in ion regulation in habitats with low NaCl levels because of its inability to reduce ion efflux and adjust ion absorption rates to maintain hemolymph ion balance. In contrast, C. quinquefasciatus exhibited a reduced ion efflux and the ability to upregulate Na+ uptake, traits necessary to extend its lower salinity limit.\n      "},{"title":"The metabolic cost of birdsong production","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/19/3379","abstract":"\n        The metabolic cost of birdsong production has not been studied in detail but is of importance in our understanding of how selective pressures shape song behavior.

Surprisingly, the metabolic cost of song production in the species with the temporally most complex song, the canary, was no greater than in the other two species. In starlings, a 16 dB increase in sound intensity was accompanied by a 1.16-fold increase in the rate of oxygen consumption. These data indicate that the metabolic cost of song production in the songbird species studied is no higher than that for other types of vocal behavior in various bird groups.

We also investigated the osteogenic effectiveness of shorter-term recovery periods, lasting several seconds (0.5, 3.5, 7 or 14 s), introduced between each of 36 identical daily loading cycles. Using the rat tibia four-point bending model, the right tibia of 144 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats was subjected to bending, sham bending or no loading. In the rats receiving recovery periods between loading bouts, histomorphometric measurements from the endocortical surface of the loaded and nonloaded control (left) tibiae revealed more than 100 % higher relative bone formation rates in the 8 h recovery group than in the 0 and 0.5 h recovery groups. Approximately 8 h of recovery was sufficient to restore full mechanosensitivity to the cells. In the rats allowed time to recover between load cycles, 14 s of recovery resulted in significantly higher (66–190 %) relative bone formation rates compared to any of the three shorter recovery periods. In both experiments, bone formation in the sham-bending animals was similar to that in the nonloaded control group. The results demonstrate the importance of recovery periods for (i) restoring mechanosensitivity to bone cells and (ii) maximizing the osteogenic effects of mechanical loading (exercise) regimens.\n      "},{"title":"Characterization of transepithelial potential oscillations in the Drosophila Malpighian tubule","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/3075","abstract":"\n        The Malpighian tubule of Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model system for studying the regulation of epithelial ion transport. In acutely isolated tubules, the transepithelial potential (TEP) undergoes large oscillations in amplitude with a period of approximately 30s. The TEP oscillations are diminished by reductions in the peritubular chloride concentration in a manner consistent with their being caused by fluctuations in chloride conductance. The oscillations are eliminated by pretreating tubules with the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, although removal of peritubular calcium has no effect, suggesting that the oscillations are a result of either the release of calcium from intracellular stores or the entry of calcium from the tubule lumen. Transcripts encoding two calcium-release channels, the ryanodine receptor and the inositol trisphosphate receptor, are detectable in the tubule by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. To identify the cell type responsible for the oscillations, tubules were treated with diuretic hormones known to alter calcium levels in each of the two cell types. Leucokinin-IV, which increases calcium levels in the stellate cells, suppressed the oscillations, whereas cardioacceleratory peptide 2b (CAP2b), which increases calcium levels in the principal cells, had no effect. These data are consistent with a model in which rhythmic changes in transepithelial chloride conductance, regulated by intracellular calcium levels in the stellate cells, cause the TEP oscillations.\n      "},{"title":"The generalization of an olfactory-based conditioned response reveals unique but overlapping odour representations in the moth Manduca sexta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/3085","abstract":"\n        Most highly derived olfactory systems, such as the insect antennal lobe, discriminate among a wide array of monomolecular odourants and blends of odourants. Given the relatively limited number of neurons used to code these odours, this ability implies that neural representations for odours overlap in a cross-fiber coding scheme. Here we use the generalization of a conditioned feeding response in the sphinx moth, Manduca sexta, to quantify three geometry-based dimensions of odour space in which monomolecular odours may be assessed. In a series of experiments we show that generalization of a conditioned response from one monomolecular odour to another is a function of differences in length and shape of the carbon chain as well as the functional group on the molecule. When moths were conditioned to 2-hexanone or 1-decanol and tested with a number of alcohols and ketones, we found that the generalization of the conditioned response decreased as a function of the chain length and functional group. In contrast, when conditioned to 1-hexanol, moths failed to distinguish alcohols from ketones of the same chain length. In all of these cases, chain length did not interact with functional group, thus indicating the independence of these dimensions. Differential conditioning of alcohols and of alcohols and ketones revealed interaction of excitatory and inhibitory generalization gradients within an odour ‘dimension’. When odourants were sufficiently distinct, the peak of the generalization gradient was shifted away from the conditioning odour and in an opposite direction from the unreinforced odour. Altogether, these data substantiate the claim that these molecular characteristics are relevant coding dimensions in the moth olfactory system. These data are consistent with a cross-fiber coding scheme in which odours are coded by spatio–temporally overlapping sets of neurons, both in the periphery and in the antennal lobes.\n      "},{"title":"Effect of food shortage on the physiology and competitive abilities of sand martin (Riparia riparia) nestlings","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/3065","abstract":"\n        We examined developmental and behavioural plasticity of sand martin (Riparia riparia) nestlings hand-reared under laboratory conditions.

This simulated synchronous hatching under conditions of food restriction. (2) Half the brood were food-restricted (FR/AL nestlings), and half were fed ad libitum (AL nestlings), as in asynchronously hatched broods with differential food allocation. Under both regimens, food restriction resulted in a reduction in body mass, intestinal mass, pectoral muscle mass, fat reserves, body temperature and resting metabolic rate (RMR). However, it simultaneously triggered a significant increase in intestinal uptake rates of l-proline and locomotor activity, quantified as frequency of crawling into the artificial nest tunnel by individual nestlings. Locomotor activity and intestinal uptake rates of l-proline by FR nestlings were higher than those of FR/AL young, while body temperature and RMR of FR nestlings were lower.\n      \n        We conclude that food-restricted nestlings responded actively to food shortages by upregulating their gut function, reducing the energy costs of maintenance and increasing locomotor activity. These behavioural and physiological responses were strongest in broods of similar-sized FR nestlings, which can be interpreted as an escalation of sibling competition. Thus, developmental and behavioural plasticity may be an important factor in the evolution of sibling rivalry.\n      "},{"title":"How the clear-sky angle of polarization pattern continues underneath clouds: full-sky measurements and implications for animal orientation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/2933","abstract":"\n        One of the biologically most important parameters of the cloudy sky is the proportion P of the celestial polarization pattern available for use in animal navigation. We evaluated this parameter by measuring the polarization patterns of clear and cloudy skies using 180° (full-sky) imaging polarimetry in the red (650nm), green (550nm) and blue (450nm) ranges of the spectrum under clear and partly cloudy conditions. The resulting data were compared with the corresponding celestial polarization patterns calculated using the single-scattering Rayleigh model. We show convincingly that the pattern of the angle of polarization (e-vectors) in a clear sky continues underneath clouds if regions of the clouds and parts of the airspace between the clouds and the earth surface (being shady at the position of the observer) are directly lit by the sun. The scattering and polarization of direct sunlight on the cloud particles and in the air columns underneath the clouds result in the same e-vector pattern as that present in clear sky. This phenomenon can be exploited for animal navigation if the degree of polarization is higher than the perceptual threshold of the visual system, because the angle rather than the degree of polarization is the most important optical cue used in the polarization compass. Hence, the clouds reduce the extent of sky polarization pattern that is useful for animal orientation much less than has hitherto been assumed. We further demonstrate quantitatively that the shorter the wavelength, the greater the proportion of celestial polarization that can be used by animals under cloudy-sky conditions. As has already been suggested by others, this phenomenon may solve the ultraviolet paradox of polarization vision in insects such as hymenopterans and dipterans. The present study extends previous findings by using the technique of 180° imaging polarimetry to measure and analyse celestial polarization patterns.\n      "},{"title":"Epaxial muscle function in trotting dogs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/3053","abstract":"\n        One of the features that distinguish mammals from other groups of terrestrial vertebrates is the structure and relative size of their epaxial muscles.

To address their locomotor function, we recorded the electrical activity of the iliocostalis, longissimus dorsi and multifidus muscles of trotting dogs. Activity was monitored at both lumbar and thoracic sites. To develop and evaluate hypotheses of epaxial muscle function, we quantified footfall patterns and sagittal trunk kinematics from high-speed videos, and the magnitude and orientation of ground reaction forces from force-plate recordings. All three epaxial muscles tended to exhibit a double-bursting (biphasic) activity pattern, with the exception of the iliocostalis muscle at the thoracic site (which was uniphasic). In general, a large burst of activity in each muscle occurred during the second half of the support phase of the ipsilateral hindlimb, and was active for an average of 30% of the locomotor cycle. A smaller burst of activity occurred during the second half of the support phase of the contralateral hindlimb, and was active for an average of 15% of the locomotor cycle. Analysis of ground reaction forces and sagittal trunk kinematics led us to the hypothesis that the epaxial muscles do not directly stabilize the trunk against the vertical and horizontal components of the ground reaction force. Instead, the epaxial muscles appear to counteract the tendency of the trunk to rebound (flex) in the sagittal plane during the latter half of the support phase. This hypothesis of epaxial muscle function was supported by loading experiments performed on the longissimus dorsi muscle in the lumbar region.\n      "},{"title":"Locomotor function of the dorsal fin in teleost fishes: experimental analysis of wake forces in sunfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/2943","abstract":"\n        A key evolutionary transformation of the locomotor system of ray-finned fishes is the morphological elaboration of the dorsal fin. Within Teleostei, the dorsal fin primitively is a single midline structure supported by soft, flexible fin rays. In its derived condition, the fin is made up of two anatomically distinct portions: an anterior section supported by spines, and a posterior section that is soft-rayed. We have a very limited understanding of the functional significance of this evolutionary variation in dorsal fin design. To initiate empirical hydrodynamic study of dorsal fin function in teleost fishes, we analyzed the wake created by the soft dorsal fin of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) during both steady swimming and unsteady turning maneuvers. Digital particle image velocimetry was used to visualize wake structures and to calculate in vivo locomotor forces. Study of the vortices generated simultaneously by the soft dorsal and caudal fins during locomotion allowed experimental characterization of median-fin wake interactions.\n      \n        During high-speed swimming (i.e. above the gait transition from pectoral- to median-fin locomotion), the soft dorsal fin undergoes regular oscillatory motion which, in comparison with analogous movement by the tail, is phase-advanced (by 30% of the cycle period) and of lower sweep amplitude (by 1.0cm). Undulations of the soft dorsal fin during steady swimming at 1.1bodylengths−1 generate a reverse von Kármán vortex street wake that contributes 12% of total thrust. During low-speed turns, the soft dorsal fin produces discrete pairs of counterrotating vortices with a central region of high-velocity jet flow. This vortex wake, generated in the latter stage of the turn and posterior to the center of mass of the body, counteracts torque generated earlier in the turn by the anteriorly positioned pectoral fins and thereby corrects the heading of the fish as it begins to translate forward away from the turning stimulus. One-third of the laterally directed fluid force measured during turning is developed by the soft dorsal fin. For steady swimming, we present empirical evidence that vortex structures generated by the soft dorsal fin upstream can constructively interact with those produced by the caudal fin downstream. Reinforcement of circulation around the tail through interception of the dorsal fin’s vortices is proposed as a mechanism for augmenting wake energy and enhancing thrust.\n      \n        Swimming in fishes involves the partitioning of locomotor force among several independent fin systems. Coordinated use of the pectoral fins, caudal fin and soft dorsal fin to increase wake momentum, as documented for L. macrochirus, highlights the ability of teleost fishes to employ multiple propulsors simultaneously for controlling complex swimming behaviors.\n      "},{"title":"Running in the surf: hydrodynamics of the shore crab Grapsus tenuicrustatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/3097","abstract":"\n        When locomoting in water, animals experience hydrodynamic forces due to ambient water motion and their own motion through the water. Because an aquatic pedestrian must maintain contact with the substratum to locomote, hydrodynamic forces which can dislodge an animal have the capacity to constrain the postures, gaits and speeds an animal can use. This study measured hydrodynamic forces on the amphibious shore crab Grapsus tenuicrustatus in aquatic and terrestrial postures. The crabs’ locomotory speeds and ambient water velocities in their habitat were considered in predicting the conditions under which a crab is likely to overturn or wash away. A non-moving crab can withstand 200% faster flow in the aquatic posture than in the terrestrial posture. A crab using the terrestrial posture while locomoting through still water experiences 132% greater drag and 17% greater acceleration reaction forces than it does in the aquatic posture. Due to the lower hydrodynamic forces in the aquatic posture, a crab could locomote up to 50% more quickly or through a faster water flow environment than it could in the terrestrial posture. In faster flow environments like wave-swept rocky shores, a crab in either posture would have to actively grasp the substratum to keep from being dislodged, preventing it from using a punting gait. In slower flow environments, animals can locomote faster and take advantage of different gaits that are not available to them in faster flow environments.\n      "},{"title":"Mechanisms of helical swimming: asymmetries in the morphology, movement and mechanics of larvae of the ascidian Distaplia occidentalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/2959","abstract":"\n        A great diversity of unicellular and invertebrate organisms swim along a helical path, but it is not well understood how asymmetries in the body shape or the movement of propulsive structures affect a swimmer’s ability to perform the body rotation necessary to move helically. The present study found no significant asymmetries in the body shape of ascidian larvae (Distaplia occidentalis) that could operate to rotate the body during swimming. By recording the three-dimensional movement of free-swimming larvae, it was found that the tail possessed two bends, each with constant curvature along their length. As these bends traveled posteriorly, the amplitude of curvature changes was significantly greater in the concave-left direction than in the concave-right direction. In addition to this asymmetry, the tail oscillated at an oblique angle to the midline of the trunk. These asymmetries generated a yawing moment that rotated the body in the counterclockwise direction from a dorsal view, according to calculations from hydrodynamic theory. The tails of resting larvae were bent in the concave-left direction with a curvature statistically indistinguishable from the median value for tail curvature during swimming. The flexural stiffness of the tails of larvae, measured in three-point bending, may be great enough to allow the resting curvature of the tail to have an effect on the symmetry of kinematics. This work suggests that asymmetrical tail motion is an important mechanism for generating a yawing moment during swimming in ascidian larvae and that these asymmetries may be caused by the tail’s bent shape. Since helical motion requires that moments also be generated in the pitching or rolling directions, other mechanisms are required to explain fully how ascidian larvae generate and control helical swimming.\n      "},{"title":"A novel 14-3-3 gene is osmoregulated in gill epithelium of the euryhaline teleost Fundulus heteroclitus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/2975","abstract":"\n        We have cloned and analyzed the full-length coding sequence and 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of a unique 14-3-3 gene of the euryhaline teleost Fundulus heteroclitus, which we named 14-3-3.a. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the 14-3-3.a gene product is most similar to vertebrate 14-3-3ζ and β, yet it displays considerable divergence to known classes of vertebrate 14-3-3 isoforms. The N and C termini of 14-3-3.a are the most unique regions, whereas the amino acid residues forming the amphipathic ligand-binding groove are highly conserved. F. heteroclitus 14-3-3.a mRNA expression is high in gill epithelium, moderate in intestine and brain, and low in gonads, white muscle and heart. Because 14-3-3 proteins are important molecular scaffolds and cofactors for phosphoproteins and signaling complexes, the high level of 14-3-3.a expression in gill epithelium of the euryhaline teleost F. heteroclitus suggests that it is crucial for signal transduction in gill epithelial cells. We provide evidence that 14-3-3.a is involved in osmosensory signal transduction by showing that its mRNA and protein levels in gill epithelium, but not in any other tissue analyzed, increase two- to fourfold within 24h of salinity transfer of fish from sea water to fresh water. These data are clear evidence for an important role of 14-3-3.a in the remodeling of gill epithelium during transition of euryhaline fish between plasma-hyperosmotic and plasma-hyposmotic environments.\n      "},{"title":"Characteristic features and ligand specificity of the two olfactory receptor classes from Xenopus laevis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/2987","abstract":"\n        Amphibia have two classes of olfactory receptors (ORs), class I (fish-like receptors) and class II (mammalian-like receptors). These two receptor classes correspond to the two classes identified in other vertebrates, and amphibians thus provide a unique opportunity to compare olfactory receptors of both classes in one animal species, without the constraints of evolutionary distance between different vertebrate orders, such as fish and mammals. We therefore identified the complete open reading frames of class I and class II ORs in Xenopus laevis. In addition to allowing a representative comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences between both receptor classes, we were also able to perform differential functional analysis. These studies revealed distinct class-specific motifs, particularly in the extracellular loops 2 and 3, which might be of importance for the interaction with odorants, as well as in the intracellular loops 2 and 3, which might be responsible for interactions with specific G-proteins. The results of functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes, comparing distinct receptor types, support the idea that class I receptors are activated by water-soluble odorants, whereas class II receptors are activated by volatile compounds.\n      "},{"title":"Molecular cloning and sequence of Sparus aurata skeletal myosin light chains expressed in white muscle: developmental expression and thyroid regulation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/3009","abstract":"\n        Two full-length cDNA clones encoding the skeletal myosin light chain 2 (MLC2; 1452bp) and myosin light chain 3 (MLC3; 972bp) were isolated from a cDNA library prepared from gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata larvae. The MLC2 cDNA encoded a predicted protein of 170 residues that was 79% identical to rabbit MLC2 over the entire length and 87% identical within the Ca2+-binding region. The deduced amino acid sequence of MLC3 was 153 residues in length and was 91% and 69% identical to the zebrafish and rabbit MLC3, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that in adults both transcripts were expressed in fast white muscle only. MLC2 appeared earlier in development: MLC2 transcripts were detectable from the beginning of segmentation, whereas MLC3 transcripts did not appear until 27h post-fertilisation. At this developmental stage, a second MLC2 transcript of 0.89 kilobase-pairs was present. MLCs exhibited a different age-related pattern of response to varied thyroidal states, which were experimentally induced by the administration of 1μgg−1bodymass of thyroxine (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3), or 5ngg−1bodymass of the hypothyroidal compound thiourea; MLC3 expression was not significantly affected, whereas levels of MLC2 transcripts were significantly elevated in the white muscle only of juvenile sea bream after administration of T4. Although the mechanism of thyroidal regulation of MLC expression remains unknown, the present results suggest that different regulatory mechanisms exist for different MLCs.\n      "},{"title":"Direct measurement of oxygen partial pressure in a flying bumblebee","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/2999","abstract":"\n        The gas transport system of a bumblebee was investigated by measuring the oxygen partial pressure PO2 in the wing muscle. In the resting bee, PO2 showed a regular pattern of fluctuation with a typical period of 70–120s. Fluctuations in muscular PO2 were associated with intermittent abdominal pumping. Ventilation by abdominal movements may not be necessary during rest because PO2 is high (8.5–9.2kPa) in the anaesthetised bee. Thermal effects on muscular PO2 were examined by cooling the bee, causing the amplitude of PO2 fluctuations to increase. In most flight experiments, the bee started to fly after elevating muscle PO2 by abdominal pumping; muscle PO2 then decreased at the onset of flight. However, when a flight began without pre-flight ventilation, PO2 increased monotonically. During flight, muscle PO2 reached a mean level (6.36±1.83kPa) that was much higher than the lowest value recorded during discontinuous ventilation during rest. The bumblebee effectively uses abdominal movements to assist in convective gas transport not only during flight but also at rest.\n      "},{"title":"Glucagon-like peptide isolated from the eel intestine: effects on atrial beating","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/3019","abstract":"\n        A new glucagon-like peptide was isolated from the intestine of the eel Anguilla japonica. The primary structure was determined by sequence analysis after cleavage with lysyl endopeptidase, quantitative amino acid analysis and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry as HSQGTFTNDY10SKYLETRRAQ20DFVQWLMNSK30RSGGPT. Since its structure is similar to that of oxyntomodulins (OXMs) reported in various vertebrates, we named this peptide eel oxyntomodulin (eOXM). We found that eOXM enhanced the contractile force and the beating rate of the eel atrium in a dose-dependent manner. These effects of eOXM were not inhibited by betaxolol, a β1-adrenoceptor antagonist, indicating that the actions of eOXM were independent of those of adrenaline. eOXM enhanced the intracellular Ca2+ concentration of the myocardium. The contractility of the eel atrium was greatly reduced after omitting Ca2+ from the bathing medium or after treatment with verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker. After inhibiting Ca2+ entry under these conditions, the inotropic effect of eOXM was markedly reduced, but the chronotropic effect was not altered significantly. These results indicate that the inotropic effect of eOXM is via a stimulation of Ca2+ influx but that the chronotropic effect may be independent of extracellular Ca2+.\n      "},{"title":"Evaluating the use of ram and suction during prey capture by cichlid fishes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/3039","abstract":"\n        We characterized prey-capture strategies in seven species of cichlid fishes representing diverse trophic habits and anticipated feeding abilities. The species examined were Petenia splendida, Cichla ocellaris, Cichlasoma minckleyi, Astronotus ocellatus, Crenicichla geayi, Heros severus (formerly Cichlasoma severum) and Cyprichromis leptosoma. Three individuals per species were filmed with video at 500Hz as they captured live adult Artemia sp. and Poecilia reticulata. For each feeding sequence, we measured the contribution of predator movement towards the prey (i.e. ram) and the movement of prey towards the predator due to suction. The use of ram differed significantly among prey types and predator species, varying as much as sixfold across predator species. High values of ram resulted in high attack velocities. Jaw protrusion contributed as much as 50% to overall ram values in some species, verifying its role in enhancing attack velocity. Suction distance did not vary significantly among species. Diversity in prey-capture behavior was therefore found to reflect differences among species in the strategy used to approach prey. Limited variation in the distance from which prey were sucked into the mouth is interpreted as the result of an expected exponential decline in water velocity with distance from the mouth of the suction-feeding predator. We propose that this relationship represents a major constraint on the distance over which suction feeding is effective for all aquatic-feeding predators.\n      "},{"title":"The impact of host plant on the abundance and function of symbiotic bacteria in an aphid","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/17/3027","abstract":"\n        The black-bean aphid Aphis fabae bears populations of coccoid symbiotic bacteria Buchnera spp. at 2.0–3.2×107cellsmg−1aphidmass and rod-shaped secondary symbionts of uncertain taxonomic affiliation at 0.1–0.6×107cellsmg−1aphidmass. Buchnera provides essential amino acids, supplementing the poor supply in the aphid diet of plant phloem sap. Comparison of the performance of A. fabae containing and experimentally deprived of their bacteria showed that the bacteria caused increased larval mass of aphids reared on Chenopodium album and Papaver dubium plants, but not when reared on Lamium purpureum.

It is proposed that the shortfall in threonine, possibly compounded by the high density of secondary symbionts, may contribute to the poor performance of the aphids on L. purpureum.

We investigated the\ninteraction between body movements and the flow around swimming eels using\ntwo-dimensional particle image velocimetry. Maximum flow velocities adjacent\nto the eel's body increase almost linearly from head to tail, suggesting that\neels generate thrust continuously along their body. The wake behind eels\nswimming at 1.5Ls-1, where L is body length,\nconsisted of a double row of double vortices with little backward momentum.\nThe eel sheds two vortices per half tail-beat, which can be identified by\ntheir shedding dynamics as a start—stop vortex of the tail and a vortex\nshed when the body-generated flows reach the `trailing edge' and cause\nseparation. Two consecutively shed ipsilateral body and tail vortices combine\nto form a vortex pair that moves away from the mean path of motion.

We examined 191 separate sets of kinematic patterns that differed with respect to stroke amplitude, angle of attack, flip timing, flip duration and the shape and magnitude of stroke deviation. Instantaneous aerodynamic forces were measured using a two-dimensional force sensor mounted at the base of the wing. The influence of unsteady rotational effects was assessed by comparing the time course of measured forces with that of corresponding translational quasi-steady estimates. For each pattern, we also calculated mean stroke-averaged values of the force coefficients and an estimate of profile power. The results of this analysis may be divided into four main points.\n      \n        (i) For a short, symmetrical wing flip, mean lift was optimized by a stroke amplitude of 180° and an angle of attack of 50°. At all stroke amplitudes, mean drag increased monotonically with increasing angle of attack. Translational quasi-steady predictions better matched the measured values at high stroke amplitude than at low stroke amplitude. This discrepancy was due to the increasing importance of rotational mechanisms in kinematic patterns with low stroke amplitude.\n      \n        (ii) For a 180° stroke amplitude and a 45° angle of attack, lift was maximized by short-duration flips occurring just slightly in advance of stroke reversal. Symmetrical rotations produced similarly high performance. Wing rotation that occurred after stroke reversal, however, produced very low mean lift.\n      \n        (iii) The production of aerodynamic forces was sensitive to changes in the magnitude of the wing’s deviation from the mean stroke plane (stroke deviation) as well as to the actual shape of the wing tip trajectory. However, in all examples, stroke deviation lowered aerodynamic performance relative to the no deviation case. This attenuation was due, in part, to a trade-off between lift and a radially directed component of total aerodynamic force. Thus, while we found no evidence that stroke deviation can augment lift, it nevertheless may be used to modulate forces on the two wings. Thus, insects might use such changes in wing kinematics during steering maneuvers to generate appropriate force moments.\n      \n        (iv) While quasi-steady estimates failed to capture the time course of measured lift for nearly all kinematic patterns, they did predict with reasonable accuracy stroke-averaged values for the mean lift coefficient. However, quasi-steady estimates grossly underestimated the magnitude of the mean drag coefficient under all conditions. This discrepancy was due to the contribution of rotational effects that steady-state estimates do not capture. This result suggests that many prior estimates of mechanical power based on wing kinematics may have been grossly underestimated.\n      "},{"title":"THE effects of tonic lung inflation on ventilation in the American bullfrog Rana catesbeiana Shaw","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/15/2647","abstract":"\n        This study was designed to determine whether lung inflation stimulates or inhibits breathing in frogs by examining the effect of tonic lung inflation on the ‘fictive’ breathing pattern of decerebrate, unidirectionally ventilated bullfrogs. Neural discharge was monitored in the trigeminal nerve as an indication of the frequency and force of contraction of the buccal pump, and in the laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve as an indication of glottal opening, and hence fictive lung ventilation. Based on the temporal coordination of discharge in the trigeminal and vagus nerves during naturally occurring breaths it was possible to characterize the fictive breaths as inflation, deflation or balanced breaths. Increasing lung inflation increased absolute breathing frequency by reducing the duration of apnea between breaths and promoting a change in breathing pattern from no breathing to single breaths, breathing episodes and, finally, to continuous breathing. Associated with this was a decrease in the amplitude and area of the integrated trigeminal electroneurogram associated with the lung breaths, indicative of a reduction in the force of the buccal pump, and a shift in the timing of the trigeminal and vagal discharge, indicative of a shift from inflation to deflation breaths. Taken together the data suggest that lung deflation produces infrequent, large-amplitude inflation breaths or cycles, but that progressive lung inflation changes the breathing pattern to one of high-frequency attempts to deflate the lungs that are largely passive, and accompanied by contractions of the buccal pump that are no larger than those associated with normal buccal oscillations.\n      "},{"title":"Rainbow trout glucose transporter (OnmyGLUT1): functional assessment in Xenopus laevis oocytes and expression in fish embryos","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/15/2667","abstract":"\n        Recently, we reported the cloning of a putative glucose transporter (OnmyGLUT1) from rainbow trout embryos.

Transport of d-glucose was analysed in Xenopus laevis oocytes following microinjection of mRNA transcribed in vitro. These experiments confirmed that OnmyGLUT1 is a facilitative Na+-independent transporter. Assessment of substrate selectivity, sensitivity to cytochalasin B and phloretin and kinetic parameters showed that the rainbow trout glucose transporter was similar to a carp transporter and to mammalian GLUT1. Embryonic expression of OnmyGLUT1 was studied using whole-mount in situ hybridization. Ubiquitous distribution of transcripts was observed until the early phase of somitogenesis. During the course of organogenesis, somitic expression decreased along the rostro-caudal axis, finally ceasing in the mature somites. The OnmyGLUT1 transcripts were detected in the neural crest during the whole study period. Transcripts were also found in structures that are likely to originate from the neural crest cells (gill arches, pectoral fins, upper jaw, olfactory organs and primordia of mouth lips). Hexose transport activity was detected at all developmental stages after blastulation.

Mechanistically, they recognize and bind to non-native proteins, prevent the aggregation of unfolded proteins and also, in some cases, facilitate refolding. Although a great deal is known about the cellular function of molecular chaperones in general, very little is known about the effect of temperature on molecular chaperones in non-model organisms, particularly in ectotherms that fold proteins under variable-temperature conditions in nature. To address this issue, we studied the temperature interactions of a major cytosolic molecular chaperone, Hsc70, from the eurythermal marine goby Gillichthys mirabilis. Using in vitro assays, we measured the intrinsic activity, unfolded-protein-stimulated activity, temperature sensitivity and heat stability of the ATPase activity of native Hsc70 purified from G. mirabilis white muscle. Similar to other chaperones in the 70kDa heat-shock protein family, G. mirabilis Hsc70 exhibited a low intrinsic ATPase activity that was stimulated in vitro by the addition of unfolded protein. Across the environmentally relevant temperature range (10–35°C), the ATPase activity of G. mirabilis Hsc70 displayed differential thermal sensitivity, with the greatest sensitivity occurring between 10 and 15°C and the least sensitivity between 15 and 25°C. In addition, the activity of Hsc70 was not significantly different between the unstimulated and unfolded-protein-stimulated treatments, suggesting that the ATPase activity and the peptide-binding domain of Hsc70 have similar thermal sensitivities in vitro. Finally, the thermal stability of Hsc70 ATPase activity greatly exceeded environmental temperatures for G. mirabilis, with activity up to 62.5°C. Overall, the biochemical characterization of the ATPase activity suggests that, although Hsc70 is not an extraordinarily thermally stable protein, it is capable of protein chaperoning cycles even at the extremes of environmental temperatures encountered by G. mirabilis in nature.\n      "},{"title":"A sport-physiological perspective on bird migration: evidence for flight-induced muscle damage","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/15/2683","abstract":"\n        Exercise-induced muscle damage is a well-described consequence of strenuous exercise, but its potential importance in the evolution of animal activity patterns is unknown. We used plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity as an indicator of muscle damage to investigate whether the high intensity, long-duration flights of two migratory shorebird species cause muscle damage that must be repaired during stopover. In two years of study, plasma CK activity was significantly higher in migrating western sandpipers (a non-synchronous, short-hop migrant), than in non-migrants. Similarly, in the bar-tailed godwit (a synchronous, long-jump migrant), plasma CK activity was highest immediately after arrival from a 4000–5000km flight from West Africa to The Netherlands, and declined before departure for the arctic breeding areas. Late-arriving godwits had higher plasma CK activity than birds that had been at the stopover site longer. Juvenile western sandpipers making their first southward migration had higher plasma CK activity than adults. These results indicate that muscle damage occurs during migration, and that it is exacerbated in young, relatively untrained birds. However, the magnitude of the increases in plasma CK activity associated with migratory flight were relatively small, suggesting that the level of muscle damage is moderate. Migrants may avoid damage behaviourally, or have efficient biochemical and physiological defences against muscle injury.\n      "},{"title":"Mechanisms of urea tolerance in urea-adapted populations of Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/15/2699","abstract":"\n        When behavioral avoidance cannot prevent an animal from being exposed to novel environmental toxins, physiological mechanisms must cope with the toxin and its effects. We are investigating the basis of urea tolerance in populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have been selected to survive and develop in food containing 300mmoll−1 urea. Previous research has demonstrated that the urea-selected larvae have lower levels of urea in their body than control larvae reared under the same conditions. The current series of experiments focuses on three possible ways of reducing urea levels in the body: urea metabolism, increased urea excretion and decreased urea uptake from the environment. We tested for urea metabolism directly, by assaying for activity of two urea-metabolizing enzymes, and indirectly, by looking for reduced urea content of their medium. To measure urea excretion rates in whole animals, we reared control and urea-selected larvae on urea-containing food (urea food), switched them to normal food and monitored the loss of urea from their hemolymph. We measured urea uptake by rearing control and selected larvae on normal food, switching them to urea food and monitoring the rate of urea appearance in the hemolymph. We found no evidence for urea metabolism by either direct or indirect methods. Control larvae excreted urea at a higher rate than selected, probably because they contained more urea than the selected larvae and thus had a greater gradient for urea loss. The rate of urea uptake in selected larvae was 2mmoll−1h−1 slower than the rate in control larvae, a difference that could account for the measured differences in body urea levels. Thus the selected larvae appear to have adapted to urea exposure primarily by decreasing the ability of urea to enter their body in the first place. The mechanism responsible for this reduction in uptake is uncertain.\n      "},{"title":"Effects of sublethal ammonia exposure on swimming performance in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/15/2691","abstract":"\n        Adult trout Oncorhynchus mykiss fitted with a dorsal aortic catheter were exposed to 288±15μmoll−1 (mean ± s.e.m.) total ammonia for 24h in water at a pH of 8.39±0.02, while swimming at a speed equivalent to 0.75bodylengthss−1 (BLs−1) in a Brett-type tunnel respirometer. The fish were then exposed to stepwise increments in swimming speed (0.25BLs−1 every 30min) until exhaustion. Measurements of oxygen uptake (MO2) and plasma total ammonia levels and pH were made at each speed. Control trout were treated identically but without exposure to ammonia. Ammonia exposure caused an increase in plasma total ammonia level to 436±34μmoll−1, compared to 183±30μmoll−1in control animals (N=6). A significant reduction in total plasma ammonia level was found in both groups during exercise, despite a large negative concentration gradient in those exposed to an elevated concentration of ammonia in water, which may indicate an active excretory process. The overall increase in plasma ammonia levels in exposed trout was associated with a significant reduction in critical swimming speed (Ucrit) to 1.61±0.17BLs−1 from 2.23±0.15BLs−1 in control animals. Ammonia-exposed trout had a significantly higher maintenance metabolic rate (MMR) than control fish, when estimated as the y-intercept of the relationship between swimming speed and MO2. Active metabolic rate (AMR, maximum MO2 as measured at Ucrit) was significantly lower in ammonia-exposed animals, leading to a profound reduction in factorial aerobic scope (AMR/MMR). Reduced Ucrit was also linked to a reduction in maximum tailbeat frequency. Calculation of membrane potentials (EM) in the white muscle of fish swum to Ucrit revealed a significant partial depolarisation of white muscle in ammonia-exposed fish. This may have prevented white muscle recruitment and contributed to the reduced maximum tailbeat frequency and overall impairment of swimming performance in the ammonia-exposed fish.\n      "},{"title":"Bursting properties of caudal neurosecretory cells in the flounder Platichthys flesus, in vitro","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/15/2733","abstract":"\n        Bursting activity in type 1 Dahlgren cells was studied using intra- and extracellular recording from an in vitro preparation of the caudal neurosecretory system of the euryhaline flounder. 45% of cells showed spontaneous bursts of approximately 120s duration and 380s cycle period. Similar bursts were triggered by short duration (<5s) depolarising or hyperpolarising pulses. Cells displayed a characteristic depolarising after potential, following either an action potential with associated afterhyperpolarisation, or a hyperpolarising current pulse. This depolarising after potential was related to a ‘sag’ potential, which developed during the hyperpolarising pulse. Both the depolarising after potential and the sag potential occurred only in cells at more depolarised (<60mV) holding potentials. In addition, the amplitude of the depolarising after potential was dependent on the amplitude and the duration of the hyperpolarising pulse. The depolarising after potential following action potentials may provide a mechanism for facilitating repetitive firing during a burst. Extracellular recording revealed similar bursting in individual units which was not, however, synchronised between units. Spontaneous bursting activity recorded both intra- and extracellularly was inhibited by application of a known neuromodulator of the system, 5-hydroxytryptamine.

The present study investigated the dependence of haemolymph sugar levels in foraging honeybees on metabolic rate and whether the haemolymph sugar level is regulated. Free-flying foraging bees were trained to collect controlled amounts of sucrose solution of different concentrations (15%, 30% or 50% sucrose w/w). Immediately after feeding, metabolic rate was measured over a given time depending on the sucrose concentration, then crop-emptying rate and haemolymph sugar levels were measured. Bees exhibiting a wide range of metabolic rates were compared to establish whether the observed differences in haemolymph sugar levels were due to limits in the supply of sugars from the crop or in the rate of trehalose synthesis in the fat bodies. Independent of the concentration of the sucrose solution supplied, haemolymph trehalose, glucose and fructose levels were constant for metabolic rates from 0 to 4.5mlCO2h−1. At higher metabolic rates, trehalose concentration decreased while that of glucose and fructose increased, with the exception of bees fed 15% sucrose solution. As the supply of sugar from the crop via the proventriculus was sufficient to support even the highest metabolic rates, the observed pattern must result from an upper limit in the capacity of the fat body to synthesise trehalose. The maximal rate of conversion of glucose to trehalose in the fat body was therefore calculated to average 92.4μgglucosemin−1. However, for bees fed 15% sucrose solution both the rate of conversion of glucose to trehalose and the rate of sugar transport from the crop to the ventricle were limited, together resulting in a decrease in total haemolymph sugar levels for metabolic rates higher than 5mlCO2h−1.\n      "},{"title":"Flight kinematics of the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) over a wide range of speeds in a wind tunnel","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/15/2741","abstract":"\n        Two barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) flying in the Lund wind tunnel were filmed using synchronised high-speed cameras to obtain posterior, ventral and lateral views of the birds in horizontal flapping flight.

Wingbeat frequency showed a clear U-shaped relationship with air speed with minima at 8.9ms−1(bird 1) and 8.7ms−1 (bird 2). A method previously used by other authors of estimating the body drag coefficient (CD,par) by obtaining agreement between the calculated minimum power (Vmin) and the observed minimum wingbeat frequency does not appear to be valid in this species, possibly due to upstroke pauses that occur at intermediate and high speeds, causing the apparent wingbeat frequency to be lower. These upstroke pauses represent flap-gliding, which is possibly a way of adjusting the force generated to the requirements at medium and high speeds, similar to the flap-bound mode of flight in other species. Body tilt angle, tail spread and angle of attack all increase with decreasing speed, thereby providing an additional lift surface and suggesting an important aerodynamic function for the tail at low speeds in forward flight.

Active muscles in vivo can shorten, lengthen or remain isometric, and their mechanical performance depends on the relative magnitude and timing of these patterns of fascicle strain and activation. It has recently been suggested that terrestrial animals may conserve metabolic energy during locomotion by minimizing limb extensor muscle strain during stance, when the muscle is active, facilitating more economical force generation and elastic energy recovery from limb muscle–tendon units. However, whereas the ankle extensors of running turkeys and hopping wallabies have been shown to generate force with little length change (<6% strain), similar muscles in cats appear to change length more substantially while active. Because previous work has tended to focus on the mechanical behavior of ankle extensors during animal movements, the actions of more proximal limb muscles are less well understood. To explore further the hypothesis of force economy and isometric behavior of limb muscles during terrestrial locomotion, we measured patterns of electromyographic (EMG) activity and fascicle strain (using sonomicrometry) in two of the largest muscles of the rat hindlimb, the biceps femoris (a hip extensor) and vastus lateralis (a knee extensor) during walking, trotting and galloping. Our results show that the biceps and vastus exhibit largely overlapping bursts of electrical activity during the stance phase of each step cycle in all gaits. During walking and trotting, this activity typically commences shortly before the hindlimb touches the ground, but during galloping the onset of activity depends on whether the limb is trailing (first limb down) or leading (second limb down), particularly in the vastus. In the trailing limb, the timing of the onset of vastus activity is slightly earlier than that observed during walking and trotting, but in the leading limb, this activity begins much later, well after the foot makes ground contact (mean 7% of the step cycle). In both muscles, EMG activity typically ceases approximately two-thirds of the way through the stance phase. While electrically active during stance, biceps fascicles shorten, although the extent of shortening differs significantly among gaits (P<0.01). Total average fascicle shortening strain in the biceps is greater during walking (23±3%) and trotting (27±5%) than during galloping (12±5% and 19±6% in the trailing and leading limbs, respectively). In contrast, vastus fascicles typically lengthen (by 8–16%, depending on gait) over the first half of stance, when the muscle is electrically active, before shortening slightly or remaining nearly isometric over much of the second half of stance. Interestingly, in the leading limb during galloping, vastus fascicles lengthen prior to muscle activation and exhibit substantial shortening (10±2%) during the period when EMG activity is recorded. Thus, patterns of muscle activation and/or muscle strain differ among gaits, between muscles and even within the same muscle of contralateral hindlimbs (as during galloping). In contrast to the minimal strain predicted by the force economy hypothesis, our results suggest that proximal limb muscles in rats operate over substantial length ranges during stance over various speeds and gaits and exhibit complex and changing activation and strain regimes, exemplifying the variable mechanical roles that muscles can play, even during level, steady-speed locomotion.\n      "},{"title":"Physiological characterisation of antennal mechanosensory descending interneurons in an insect (Gryllus bimaculatus, Gryllus campestris) brain","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2265","abstract":"\n        We investigated five different descending brain interneurons with dendritic arborizations in the deutocerebrum in the crickets Gryllus bimaculatus and G. campestris. These interneurones convey specific antennal mechanosensory information to the ventral nerve cord and all responded to forced antennal movements. These interneurones coded for velocity and showed preferences for distinct sectors of the total range of antennal movements. Their axons descended into the posterior connective either ipsilateral or contalateral to the cell body. Electrical stimulation of sensory nerves indicated that the interneurons received input from different afferents of the two antennal base segments. One interneuron had a particularly large axon with a conduction velocity of 4.4ms−1. This was the only one of the five interneurons that also received visual input. Its activity was reduced during voluntary antennal movements. The reduction in activity occurred even after de-efferentation of the antenna, indicating that it had a central origin. Although we do not have experimental evidence for behavioural roles for the descending antennal mechanosensory interneurons, the properties described here suggest an involvement in the perception of objects in the path of the cricket.\n      "},{"title":"Swing- and support-related muscle actions differentially trigger human walk–run and run–walk transitions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2277","abstract":"\n        There has been no consistent explanation as to why humans prefer changing their gait from walking to running and from running to walking at increasing and decreasing speeds, respectively. This study examined muscle activation as a possible determinant of these gait transitions. Seven subjects walked and ran on a motor-driven treadmill for 40s at speeds of 55, 70, 85, 100, 115, 130 and 145% of the preferred transition speed. The movements of subjects were videotaped, and surface electromyographic activity was recorded from seven major leg muscles. Resultant moments at the leg joints during the swing phase were calculated. During the swing phase of locomotion at preferred running speeds (115, 130, 145%), swing-related activation of the ankle, knee and hip flexors and peaks of flexion moments were typically lower (P<0.05) during running than during walking. At preferred walking speeds (55, 70, 85%), support-related activation of the ankle and knee extensors was typically lower during stance of walking than during stance of running (P<0.05). These results support the hypothesis that the preferred walk–run transition might be triggered by the increased sense of effort due to the exaggerated swing-related activation of the tibialis anterior, rectus femoris and hamstrings; this increased activation is necessary to meet the higher joint moment demands to move the swing leg during fast walking. The preferred run–walk transition might be similarly triggered by the sense of effort due to the higher support-related activation of the soleus, gastrocnemius and vastii that must generate higher forces during slow running than during walking at the same speed.\n      "},{"title":"Analysis of epithelial K+ transport in Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster: evidence for spatial and temporal heterogeneity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2289","abstract":"\n        Transport of K+ by the lower, main and distal segments of the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster was analyzed using self-referencing K+-selective microelectrodes. Transport properties of the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster change along their length. Self-referencing ion-selective (SeRIS) microelectrode measurements (relative to the bath concentration of 20 mmoll−1) showed a 1% reduction (P<0.05) of [K+] in the unstirred layer adjacent to the main segment of the Malpighian tubules, confirming secretion of K+ from the bath to the tubule lumen. Conversely, SeRIS measurements showed a 0.7% increase (P<0.05) in [K+] in the unstirred layer adjacent to the lower segment of Malpighian tubules, confirming reabsorption of K+ from the luminal fluid to the bath. Measurements using SeRIS also showed that the distal segment neither secreted nor reabsorbed K+. There was pronounced spatial heterogeneity in K+ transport by the lower segment and the main segment; not all morphologically similar cells participated equally in K+ transport, nor did all main segment cells respond equally to stimulation of K+ transport by cyclic AMP. Pronounced temporal heterogeneity in K+ reabsorption by the lower Malpighian tubules was also observed. We suggest that this reflects periodic reduction in K+ reabsorption due to retention of fluid within the lower segment when the ureter contracts.\n      "},{"title":"Seasonal variation in energy expenditure, water flux and food consumption of Arabian oryx Oryx leucoryx","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2301","abstract":"\n        We report on the energy expenditure and water flux, measured in the laboratory and in the field, of the Arabian oryx Oryx leucoryx, the largest desert ruminant for which measurements of the field metabolic rate of free-living individuals have been made using doubly labeled water. Prior to extirpation of this species in the wild in 1972, conservationists sequestered a number of individuals for captive breeding; in 1989, oryx were reintroduced in Saudi Arabia into Mahazat as-Sayd (2244km2). Apart from small pools of water available after rains, oryx do not have free-standing water available for drinking and therefore rely on grasses that they eat for preformed water intake as well as their energy needs. We tested whether oryx have a reduced fasting metabolic rate and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) in the laboratory, as do some other arid-adapted mammals, and whether oryx have high field metabolic rates (FMRs) and water influx rates (WIRs), as predicted by allometric equations for large arid-zone mammals. We measured FMR and WIR during the hot summer, when plant moisture content was low and ambient temperatures were high, and after winter rains, when the water content of grasses was high.\n      \n        For captive oryx that weighed 84.1kg, fasting metabolic rate averaged 8980kJday−1, 16.7% lower than predictions for Artiodactyla. Our own re-analysis of minimal metabolic rates among Artiodactyla yielded the equation: logV̇O2=−0.153+0.758logM, where V̇O2 is the rate of oxygen uptake in lh−1 and M is body mass in kg. Fasting metabolic rate of oryx was only 9.1% lower than predicted, suggesting that they do not have an unusually low metabolic rate. TEWL averaged 870.0mlday−1, 63.9% lower than predicted, a remarkably low value even compared with the camel, but the mechanisms that contribute to such low rates of water loss remain unresolved.\n      \n        For free-living oryx, FMR was 11076kJday−1 for animals with a mean body mass of 81.5kg during summer, whereas it was 22081kJday−1 for oryx in spring with a mean body mass of 89.0kg, values that were 48.6% and 90.4% of allometric predictions, respectively. During summer, WIR averaged 1310mlH2Oday−1, whereas in spring it was 3438mlH2Oday−1. Compared with allometric predictions, WIR was 76.9% lower than expected in summer and 43.6% lower in spring. We found no evidence to support the view that the WIR of large desert ungulates is higher than that of their mesic counterparts. On the basis of the WIR of the oryx averaged over the year and the water contents of plants in their diet, we estimated that an oryx consumes 858kg of dry matter per year.\n      "},{"title":"Nutritional regulation and tissue specificity of gene expression for proteins involved in hepatic glucose metabolism in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2351","abstract":"\n        Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are known to use dietary carbohydrates poorly. One of the hypotheses to explain the poor utilisation of dietary glucose by these fish is a dysfunction in nutritional regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism. In this study, we obtained partial clones of rainbow trout cDNAs coding for a glucose transporter (Glut2), and for the enzymes 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (6PF-2K/F-2,6BPase), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and pyruvate kinase (PK). Their deduced amino acid sequences were highly similar to those of mammals (up to 80% similarity). In a study of nutritional regulation, the Glut2 gene was highly expressed in the liver irrespective of the nutritional status of the trout, in agreement with the role of this transporter in the input (during refeeding) and output (during fasting) of glucose from the liver. Moreover, whereas PK and FBPase gene expression was high irrespective of the nutritional status, levels of hepatic 6PF-2K/F-2,6BPase mRNA were higher in fish fed with carbohydrates than in fish deprived of food. The high levels of hepatic PK, Glut2 and 6PF-2K/F-2,6BPase gene expression observed in this study suggest a high potential for tissue carbohydrate utilisation in rainbow trout. The persistence of a high level of FBPase gene expression suggests an absence of regulation of the gluconeogenic pathway by dietary carbohydrates.\n      "},{"title":"Evolution of water balance in the genus Drosophila","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2331","abstract":"\n        Fruit flies of the genus Drosophila have independently invaded deserts around the world on numerous occasions. To understand the physiological mechanisms allowing these small organisms to survive and thrive in arid environments, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of water balance in Drosophila species from different habitats. Desert (cactophilic) species were more resistant to desiccation than mesic ones. This resistance could be accomplished in three ways: by increasing the amount of water in the body, by reducing rates of water loss or by tolerating the loss of a greater percentage of body water (dehydration tolerance). Cactophilic Drosophila lost water less rapidly and appeared to be more tolerant of low water content, although males actually contained less water than their mesic congeners. However, when the phylogenetic relationships between the species were taken into account, greater dehydration tolerance was not correlated with increased desiccation resistance. Therefore, only one of the three expected adaptive mechanisms, lower rates of water loss, has actually evolved in desert Drosophila, and the other apparently adaptive difference between arid and mesic species (increased dehydration tolerance) instead reflects phylogenetic history.\n      "},{"title":"Nuclear p26, a small heat shock/α-crystallin protein, and its relationship to stress resistance in Artemia franciscana embryos","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2339","abstract":"\n        The role of the small heat shock/α-crystallin protein, p26, in transcription in Artemia franciscana embryos was examined using isolated nuclei, containing either control or elevated levels of p26, in transcription run-on assays.

The results suggest that parameters other than, or in addition to, p26 are responsible for the reduced transcription rates observed and that decreases in pHi are involved. In vivo experiments indicate that RNA synthesis and, to a lesser extent, protein synthesis are downregulated in intact embryos recovering from heat shock and that the precursor pool is not limiting. Confocal microscopy confirmed that p26 moves into nuclei in response to heat shock and anoxia in vivo, and to low pH in vitro, and indicated that the nuclear distribution of p26 is similar under all three conditions. We present evidence that unstressed (control) embryos containing p26 in all their nuclei will not hatch, even under permissive conditions, and propose that they are unable to terminate diapause.\n      \n        Potential nuclear targets of p26 chaperone activity are discussed.\n      "},{"title":"Function of the oblique hypaxial muscles in trotting dogs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2371","abstract":"\n        In trotting dogs, the pattern of activity of the obliquely oriented hypaxial muscles is consistent with the possible functions of (i) stabilization against vertical accelerations that cause the trunk to sag in the sagittal plane and (ii) stabilization against forces that tend to shear the trunk in the sagittal plane. To test these hypotheses, we compared the amount of activity of the intercostal and abdominal oblique muscles (i) when dogs carried additional mass (8–15% of body mass) supported over the limb girdles versus supported mid-trunk (test of sagittal bounce), and (ii) when dogs trotted up versus down a 10° slope (test of sagittal shear). In response to the loading manipulations, only the internal oblique muscle responded in a manner that was consistent with stabilization of the trunk against forces that cause the trunk to sag sagittally. In contrast, when the fore–aft forces were manipulated by running up- and downhill, all four of the monitored muscles changed their activity in a manner consistent with stabilization of the trunk against sagittal shearing. Specifically, muscles with a craniodorsal orientation (external oblique and external intercostal muscles) showed an increase in activity when the dogs ran downhill and a decrease when they ran uphill. Muscles with a cranioventral orientation (internal oblique and internal intercostal muscles) exhibited the opposite pattern: increased activity when the dogs ran uphill and decreased activity when they ran downhill. Changes in activity of two extrinsic appendicular muscles, the serratus ventralis and deep pectoralis, during uphill and downhill running were also consistent with the sagittal shearing hypothesis. In contrast, changes in the level of recruitment of the oblique hypaxial muscles were not consistent with stabilization of the trunk against torques that induce yaw at the girdles. Hence, we suggest that the oblique hypaxial muscles of trotting dogs act to stabilize the trunk against sagittal shearing torques induced by limb retraction (fore–aft acceleration) and protraction (fore–aft deceleration).\n      "},{"title":"Impact of movement and movement-related feedback on the lamprey central pattern generator for locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2361","abstract":"\n        A semi-reduced, minimally restrained lamprey preparation was used to investigate the impact of movement and movement-related feedback during d-glutamate-induced locomotion.

Two conditions were compared using electromyography or nerve recording: (i) muscle and spinal cord, (ii) spinal cord alone supported by the notochord. Compared with the isolated spinal cord, movement in the presence of muscle consistently and significantly increased the frequency of the motor output and reduced the phase delay among the segments. In moving preparations, coupling among the segments was reduced by two staggered hemisections to permit the strength and direction of intersegmental coupling to be estimated. The estimates revealed that movement increased the total intersegmental coupling strength and increased the proportion of the coupling that was descending over those of the isolated spinal cord.\n      \n        The effects on the phase and frequency of bursting can be explained in the light of the excitation evoked by bending that we have reported previously.

FK506 is successfully used in clinics as a drug to prevent allograft rejection and is toxic to Suberites domuncula cells in vitro at doses above 100ng ml−1. Autograft fusion of transplants from S. domuncula was not affected by FK506. Allograft non-fusion was not affected by FK506 at toxic doses; however, at the non-toxic dose of 20ng ml−1, the allografts fused with each other. It is shown that at the attachment zone in untreated and (particularly drastic) in FK506-treated allografts, expression of the genes encoding the FK506-binding proteins is upregulated. These data indicate that the drug FK506 suppresses allograft rejection in S. domuncula, most probably via interaction with expression of the gene coding for the FK506-binding proteins.\n      "},{"title":"Flight-motor-driven respiratory air flow in the hawkmoth Manduca sexta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2209","abstract":"\n        Intratracheal pressure during tethered flight was analyzed at the anterior spiracles and mesoscutellar air sacs in the hawkmoth Manduca sexta using electronic pressure sensors.

Experiments were accompanied by photocell recordings of the wingbeat. The structural differences between the mesothoracic and metathoracic spiracles are described. Deformations of the lateral thorax and their effect upon the spiracles were observed under stroboscopic light.\n      \n        During shivering, ventilation pulses are generated by the flight muscles reminiscent of an autoventilation mechanism with tidal air flow. During steady flight, however, a unidirectional airstream arises with a mean negative (subatmospheric) pressure at the first (mesothoracic) spiracles and a mean positive pressure in the mesoscutellar air sacs. As a result of this pressure difference during flight, CO2 is emitted only at the posterior spiracles.\n      \n        The suction force for the inspiration flow at the anterior spiracles is generated by the flight apparatus as a result of prevention of inspiration through the posterior thoracic spiracles. During the downstroke, the volume of the thoracic air sacs increases, while the posterior thoracic spiracles are automatically enclosed in the subalar cleft below the wing hinge and are probably closed. During the upstroke, the air sac volume decreases and the moth expires through the open posterior spiracles.\n      "},{"title":"A qualitative and quantitative study of the lung of an ostrich, Struthio camelus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2313","abstract":"\n        The ostrich lung, with its lack of interparabronchial septa, the presence of very shallow atria and exceptional morphometric refinement, structurally resembles those of small, energetic flying birds, whereas it also displays features characteristic of the flightless ratites in which the neopulmo is relatively poorly developed and a segmentum accelerans may be generally lacking. The large size of the bronchial system of the ostrich may help explain the unique shifts in the airflow pathways that must occur from resting to panting breathing, explaining its insensitivity to acid–base imbalance of the blood during sustained panting under thermal stress. The mass-specific volume of the lung is 39.1 cm3kg−1 and the volume density of the exchange tissue is remarkably high (78.31%). The blood–gas (tissue) barrier is relatively thick (0.56μm) but the plasma layer is very thin (0.14μm). In this flightless ratite bird, the mass-specific surface area of the tissue barrier (30.1 cm2g−1), the mass-specific anatomical diffusing capacity of the tissue barrier for oxygen (0.0022mlO2s−1Pa−1kg−1), the mass-specific volume of pulmonary capillary blood (6.25 cm3kg−1) and the mass-specific total anatomical diffusing capacity for oxygen (0.00073mlO2s−1Pa−1kg−1) are equivalent to or exceed those of much smaller highly aerobic volant birds.

Time from stimulus to peak force (Ta) did not change significantly with axial position and was 82±6ms at 0.45BL and 93±3ms at 0.75BL, where BL is total body length.

Maximum power outputs at ±5% strain using optimal stimuli were 17.3±1.3Wkg−1 in muscle from 0.45BL and 16.3±1.5Wkg−1 in muscle from 0.75BL. Power output peaked at a cycle frequency of 2Hz. The stimulus patterns associated with swimming generated greater force and power than those associated with terrestrial crawling. This decrease in muscle performance in eels may occur because on land the eel is constrained to a particular kinematic pattern in order to produce thrust against an underlying substratum.\n      "},{"title":"Mechanical properties of red and white swimming muscles as a function of the position along the body of the eel Anguilla anguilla","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2221","abstract":"\n        The way in which muscles power steady swimming depends on a number of factors, including fibre type and recruitment, muscle strain, stimulation pattern and intensity, and the intrinsic mechanical properties of the muscle fibres. For a number of undulatory swimming fish species, in vivo studies have shown that muscles at different positions along the body are stimulated during different phases of the strain cycle. Moreover, some intrinsic contractile properties of the muscles have been found to vary according to their position along the body.\n      \n        We report the first results on the mechanical properties of the red and white muscles of an anguilliform swimmer, Anguilla anguilla. Small preparations (0.147–1.335mg dry mass) were dissected from positions at fractions of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 of total body length (BL). We determined the time to 50% and 100% peak force and from the last stimulus to 50% relaxation for isometric contractions; we measured the sarcomere lengths that coincided with in situ resting length. None of these quantities varied significantly with the longitudinal position from which the fibres were taken. We also measured power and work output during contractions under conditions approximating those used in vivo (cycle frequency, 1Hz; strain amplitude, ±10%L0, where L0 is the length giving maximum isometric force). During these experiments, work output was affected by stimulation phase, but did not depend on the longitudinal position in the body from which the muscles were taken.\n      \n        Our results indicate that red and white eel muscles have uniform properties along the body. In this respect, they differ from the muscle of most non-anguilliforms, in which muscle kinetics varies in a systematic way along the body. Uniform properties may be beneficial for anguilliform swimmers, in which the amplitude of the travelling wave can be pronounced over the entire body length.\n      "},{"title":"Locomotion in scombrid fishes: visualization of flow around the caudal peduncle and finlets of the chub mackerel Scomber japonicus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2251","abstract":"\n        Scombrid fishes are known for high-performance locomotion; however, few data are available on scombrid locomotor hydrodynamics.

Chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus, ranging in fork length from 20 to 26 cm, swam steadily at 1.2forklengthss−1 in a recirculating flow tank. Small, reflective particles in the flow tank were illuminated by a vertical (xy) or horizontal (xz) laser light sheet. Patterns of flow in the region near the caudal peduncle were measured using digital particle image velocimetry. Patterns of flow along the peduncle and finlets were quantified using manual particle tracking; more than 800 particles were tracked for at least 12ms over a series of tailbeats from each of four fish.\n      \n        In the vertical plane, flow trajectory and flow speed were independent of the position of the finlets, indicating that the finlets did not redirect flow or affect flow speed. Along, above and below the trailing surface of the peduncle, where the finlets were oriented along the peduncular surface, flow was convergent. Along, above and below the leading surface of the peduncle, where the finlets were absent, the flow trajectory was effectively horizontal. The lack of divergent flow on the leading surface of the peduncle is consistent with cross-peduncular flow formed by the lateral motion of the peduncle interacting with convergent flow resulting from forward movement of the body.\n      \n        In the horizontal plane, particles illuminated by the xz light sheet situated approximately 3 mm below the ventral body surface were tracked within the laser light sheet for up to 40ms, indicating strong planar flow. As the peduncle decelerates, the most posterior finlet is frequently at an angle of attack of at least 20° to the incident flow, but this orientation does not result in thrust production from lift generation. Finlet 5 does redirect cross-peduncular flow and probably generates small vortices undetectable in this study. These data are the first direct demonstration that the finlets have a hydrodynamic effect on local flow during steady swimming.\n      "},{"title":"Pathways for urea production during early life of an air-breathing teleost, the African catfish Clarias gariepinus Burchell","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2155","abstract":"\n        Embryos and larvae of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus excrete significant quantities of urea.

Uricase, allantoinase, allantoicase and ureidoglycollate lyase of the uricolytic pathway were expressed in all early life stages and in adult liver of C. gariepinus. Uricase activity increased in starved larvae compared with yolk-sac larvae. The key regulatory enzyme of the teleost OUC, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase III (CPSase III), was expressed predominantly in muscle of developing C. gariepinus larvae and showed negligible activity in the absence of its allosteric effector N-acetyl-l-glutamate. CPSase III and ornithine carbamoyl transferase activities increased in fed larvae compared with starved larvae. In contrast to the early developmental stages, adult C. gariepinus expressed only low and variable levels of CPSase III, suggesting that, under the experimental conditions employed, OUC expression is influenced by developmental stage in this species. The data indicate that early C. gariepinus life stages express the enzymes necessary for urea production by uricolysis, argininolysis and the OUC, and this may explain why urea tissue levels and urea excretion rates are substantial during the early development of this air-breathing teleost.\n      "},{"title":"Spatial variation in fast muscle function of the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss during fast-starts and sprinting","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2239","abstract":"\n        Fish fast-starts and sprints are rapid kinematic events powered by the lateral myotomal musculature. A distinction can be made between fast-starts and sprint-swimming activity. Fast-starts are kinematic events involving rapid, asymmetrical movements. Sprints involve a series of symmetrical, high-frequency tailbeats that are kinematically similar to lower-frequency, sustained swimming. The patterns of muscle recruitment and strain associated with these swimming behaviours were determined using electromyography and sonomicrometry. Axial patterns of fast muscle recruitment during sprints were similar to those in slow muscle in that the duration of electromyograhic (EMG) activity decreased in a rostro-caudal direction. There was also an axial shift in activity relative to the strain cycle so that activity occurred relatively earlier in the caudal region. This may result in caudal muscle performing a greater proportion of negative work and acting as a power transmitter as well as a power producer. The threshold tailbeat frequency for recruitment of fast muscle differed with location in the myotome. Superficial muscle fibres were recruited at lower tailbeat frequencies and shortening velocities than those deeper in the musculature. During sprints, fast muscle strain ranged from ±3.4%l0 (where l0 is muscle resting length) at 0.35FL (where FL is fork length) to ±6.3%l0 at 0.65FL. Fast-starts involved a prestretch of up to 2.5%l0 followed by shortening of up to 11.3%l0. Stage 1 EMG activity began simultaneously, during muscle lengthening, at all axial locations. Stage 2 EMG activity associated with the major contralateral contraction also commenced during lengthening and proceeded along the body as a wave. Onset of muscle activity during lengthening may enhance muscle power output.\n      "},{"title":"Time course and reversibility of changes in the gizzards of red knots alternately eating hard and soft food","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2167","abstract":"\n        The ability to change organ size reversibly can be advantageous to birds that perform long migrations.

Two groups of shellfish-adapted knots (N=9 and N=10) were fed alternately a hard and a soft food type. Diet switches elicited rapid reversible changes. Switches from hard to soft food induced decreases to 60% of initial gizzard mass within 8.5 days, while switches to hard food induced increases in gizzard mass to 147% within 6.2 days. A third group of knots (N=11), adapted to soft food for more than 1 year, initially had very small gizzards (25% of the mass of shellfish-adapted gizzards), but showed a similar capacity to increase gizzard size when fed shellfish.

Solea senegalensis grow from hatching to the start of metamorphosis (approximately day 14) at twice the rate of Sparus aurata (specific growth rate for Solea senegalensis 0.25μgday−1; specific growth rate for Sparus aurata 0.12μgday−1). The tissues in Solea senegalensis larvae accumulated energetic reserves that were used during metamorphosis, which occurred during the third week after hatching. Ingestion and respiration rates differed in the two species during the experimental period. Although Solea senegalensis continued eating during metamorphosis, the specific ingestion rates decreased during the process. Nevertheless, no great differences in specific ingestion rates and rates of oxygen consumption were observed when comparing the same larval mass range. Larvae of both species showed an allometric relationship between respiration rate and biomass. The energetic efficiencies calculated in the present study denoted different metabolic patterns in each species. In Solea senegalensis, the energy used for growth increased progressively during the larval (pelagic) period and then, from the first signs of metamorphic transformation, remained almost constant. In this species, the energy allocated to growth was greater than that allocated to metabolic processes. Sparus aurata invested less energy in growth than in metabolic processes and displayed a constant energy allocation throughout the experimental period. During the first month after hatching, Solea senegalensis always allocated more energy for growth than did Sparus aurata.\n      "},{"title":"Differential and overlapping expression patterns of X-dll3 and Pax-6 genes suggest distinct roles in olfactory system development of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2049","abstract":"\n        In Xenopus laevis, the formation of the adult olfactory epithelium involves embryonic, larval and metamorphic phases. The olfactory epithelium in the principal cavity (PC) develops during embryogenesis from the olfactory placode and is thought to respond to water-borne odorants throughout larval life. During metamorphosis, the PC undergoes major transformations and is exposed to air-borne odorants. Also during metamorphosis, the middle cavity (MC) develops de novo. The olfactory epithelium in the MC has the same characteristics as that in the larval PC and is thought to respond to water-borne odorants. Using in situ hybridization, we analyzed the expression pattern of the homeobox genes X-dll3 and Pax-6 within the developing olfactory system. Early in development, X-dll3 is expressed in both the neuronal and non-neuronal ectoderm of the sense plate and in all cell layers of the olfactory placode and larval PC. Expression becomes restricted to the neurons and basal cells of the PC by mid-metamorphosis. During metamorphosis, X-dll3 is also expressed throughout the developing MC epithelium and becomes restricted to neurons and basal cells at metamorphic climax. This expression pattern suggests that X-dll3 is first involved in the patterning and genesis of all cells forming the olfactory tissue and is then involved in neurogenesis or neuronal maturation in putative water- and air-sensing epithelia. In contrast, Pax-6 expression is restricted to the olfactory placode, larval PC and metamorphic MC, suggesting that Pax-6 is specifically involved in the formation of water-sensing epithelium. The expression patterns suggest that X-dll3 and Pax-6 are both involved in establishing the olfactory placode during embryonic development, but subtle differences in cellular and temporal expression patterns suggest that these genes have distinct functions.\n      "},{"title":"Ammonia detoxification and localization of urea cycle enzyme activity in embryos of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in relation to early tolerance to high environmental ammonia levels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2145","abstract":"\n        The present study investigated the role of ammonia as a trigger for hatching, mechanisms of ammonia detoxification and the localization of urea cycle enzymes in the early life stages of freshwater rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The key urea cycle enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase III was found exclusively in the embryonic body (non-hepatic tissues); related enzymes were distributed between the liver and embryonic body. ‘Eyed-up’ trout embryos were exposed either acutely (2h) to 10mmoll−1 NH4Cl or chronically (4 days) to 0.2mmoll−1 NH4Cl. Time to hatching was not affected by either acute or chronic NH4Cl exposure. Urea levels, but not ammonia levels in the embryonic tissues, were significantly higher than in controls after both acute and chronic NH4Cl exposure, whereas there were no significant changes in urea cycle enzyme activities. Total amino acid levels in the embryonic tissues were unaltered by chronic ammonia exposure, but levels of most individual amino acids and total amino acid levels in the yolk were significantly lower (by 34–58%) than in non-exposed controls. The data indicate that trout embryos have an efficient system to prevent ammonia accumulation in embryonic tissue, by conversion of ammonia to urea in embryonic tissues and through elevation of ammonia levels in the yolk.\n      "},{"title":"Homing in wood ants, Formica japonica: use of the skyline panorama","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2063","abstract":"\n        Homeward orientation was studied in wood ants Formica japonica that, while foraging, shuttled back and forth along a 7.9m route between the nest and a feeding site located on a wide terrace platform surrounded by a conspicuous landmark panorama. The return runs of the ants were amazingly straight, not only in the controls (starting at the feeding site) but also in ants displaced for various distances to the left and right of the feeding site. These courses, however, were oriented neither parallel to the predisplacement courses nor directly towards the nest. This result excludes the use of chemical cues and celestial compass cues. Furthermore, the nest itself, or some object close to it, could not have served as a beacon.\n      \n        The extensions of the homeward paths taken by ants that had been displaced to various release sites up to 11m sideways from the training route intersected at a point far (approximately 13m) behind the nest. This result suggests that the ants used distant landmarks seen by them in their frontal fields of view.\n      \n        To test this hypothesis, the distant landmark panorama was concealed by an opaque sheet mounted at right angles to the normal return route of the ants and extending up to different elevations. Shielding the lower part of the landmark panorama had no effect on the homeward paths. However, when the screen was mounted in such a way that the ants could only see the top skyline, represented by the upper edges of a line of trees, for part of their return run, it was only during these parts that their path was oriented in the homeward direction.\n      \n        When, during the course of displacement experiments, the ants were deprived of their familiar skyline panorama, they moved in their home direction only for an extremely short distance (0.1–0.4m rather than the usual 7.9m) and then started a systematic search programme. Hence, in the present context, skylight information is not used, at least not extensively. Instead, ants use the distant skyline as a navigational guidemark.\n      "},{"title":"Shape, flapping and flexion: wing and fin design for forward flight","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2073","abstract":"\n        Both kinematics and morphology are critical determinants of performance in flapping flight. However, the functional consequences of changes in these traits are not yet well understood. Traditional aerodynamic studies of planform wing shape have suggested that high-aspect-ratio wings generate more force per area and perform more efficiently than low-aspect-ratio wings, but these analyses may neglect critical components of flapping flight such as unsteady fluid dynamics and wing or fin flexion. In this paper, we use an unsteady potential flow analysis that incorporates wing flexion to test predictions of optimal wing shape under varying degrees of unsteady motion and wing flexion. We focus on forward flapping flight and examine the effects of wing/fin morphology and movements on thrust generation and efficiency. We test the model by comparing our predictions with kinematic data derived from the aquatic flight of the ratfish Hydrolagus colliei. Our analyses show that aspect ratio and the proportion of area in the outer one-fifth of the wing can characterize wing shape in terms of aero- or hydrodynamic performance. By comparing the performance of wings that vary in these two parameters, we find that traditional predictions of optimal wing shape are valid only under limited circumstances (when flapping frequency is low, wings are stiff or wings are tapered at the tips). This indicates a complex relationship between locomotor traits and performance and helps explain the diversity of wing kinematics and morphologies observed in nature.\n      "},{"title":"Red and white muscle development in the trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as shown by in situ hybridisation of fast and slow myosin heavy chain transcripts","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2097","abstract":"\n        The axial muscle of most teleost species consists of a deep bulk of fast-contracting white fibres and a superficial strip of slow-contracting red fibres. To investigate the embryological development of fast and slow muscle in trout embryos, we carried out single and double in situ hybridisation with fast and slow myosin heavy chain (MyHC)-isoform-specific riboprobes. This showed that the slow-MyHC-positive cells originate in a region of the somite close to the notochord. As the somite matures in a rostrocaudal progression, the slow-MyHC-positive cells appear to migrate radially away from the notochord to the lateral surface of the myotome, where they form the superficial strip of slow muscle. Surprisingly, the expression pattern of the fast MyHC showed that the differentiation of fast muscle commences in the medial domain of the somite before the differentiation and migration of the slow muscle precursors. Later, as the differentiation of fast muscle progressively spreads from the inside to the outside of the myotome, slow-MyHC-expressing cells become visible medially. Our observations that the initial differentiation of fast muscle takes place in proximity to axial structures and occurs before the differentiation and migration of slow muscle progenitors are not in accord with the pattern of muscle formation in teleosts previously described in the zebrafish Danio rerio, which is often used as the model organism in fishes.\n      "},{"title":"Postprandial exercise: prioritization or additivity of the metabolic responses?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2127","abstract":"\n        Monitor lizards (Varanus exanthematicus) were used to examine the prioritization or additivity of the metabolic responses associated with exercise and digestion, either of which can elevate metabolic rate independently. Rates of oxygen consumption (V̇.O2) and ventilation (V̇.E) were measured in lizards during fasting exercise, postprandial rest and postprandial exercise. In fasting animals, V̇.O2 increased with walking speed to a maximal value of 15.9mlO2kg−1min−1 at 1.25kmh−1. Postprandial resting metabolic rate was elevated significantly above fasting levels (4.1 versus 2.0mlO2kg−1min−1). During postprandial exercise, V̇.O2 increased to a maximal value of 18.8mlO2kg−1min−1 at 1.25kmh−1. At every level of exercise, V̇.O2 was significantly higher in postprandial animals by a similar increment; the maximal rate of oxygen consumption was significantly increased by 18% in postprandial individuals. Maximal V̇.E did not differ in fasting and postprandial animals and, therefore, the greater V̇.O2max of postprandial animals cannot be attributed to a higher ventilation rate. Air convection requirement (V̇.E/V̇.O2) is significantly lower in postprandial animals at rest and at all levels of exercise, indicating a relative hypoventilation and increased pulmonary oxygen extraction efficiency. We suggest that this increased oxygen extraction may be due to decreased cardiopulmonary shunts and/or to lower mixed venous oxygen content. The data unequivocally support an additivity model rather than prioritization models for the allocation of elevated metabolic rate: the postprandial metabolic increment is not suspended during exercise, but rather is added onto the cost of exercise. It is clear that fasting exercise did not elicit truly maximal levels of cardiopulmonary oxygen transport in these animals, indicating problems for design models that make this assumption.\n      "},{"title":"Reflective properties of iridophores and fluorescent ‘eyespots’ in the loliginid squid Alloteuthis subulata and Loligo vulgaris","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2103","abstract":"\n        Observations were made of the reflective properties of the iridophore stripes of the squid Alloteuthis subulata and Loligo vulgaris, and the likely functions of these stripes are considered in terms of concealment and signalling.\n      \n        In both species, the mantle muscle is almost transparent. Stripes of iridophores run along the length of each side of the mantle, some of which, when viewed at normal incidence in white light, reflect red, others green or blue. When viewed obliquely, the wavebands best reflected move towards the blue/ultraviolet end of the spectrum and their reflections are almost 100% polarised. These are properties of quarter-wavelength stacks of chitin and cytoplasm, predicted in theoretical analyses made by Sir A. F. Huxley and Professor M. F. Land. The reflecting surfaces of the individual iridophores are almost flat and, in a given stripe, these surfaces are within a few degrees of being parallel. Both species of squid have conspicuous, brightly coloured reflectors above their eyes. These ‘eyespots’ have iridescent layers similar to those found on the mantle but are overlaid by a green fluorescent layer that does not change colour or become polarised as it is viewed more obliquely. In the sea, all reflections from the iridophore stripes will be largely confined to the blue-green parts of the spectrum and all reflections in other wavebands, such as those in the red and near ultraviolet, will be weak. The functions of the iridophores reflecting red at normal incidence must be sought in their reflections of blue-green at oblique angles of incidence. These squid rely for their camouflage mainly on their transparency, and the ventral iridophores and the red, green and blue reflective stripes must be used mainly for signalling. The reflectivities of some of these stripes are relatively low, allowing a large fraction of the incident light to be transmitted into the mantle cavity. Despite their low reflectivities, the stripes are very conspicuous when viewed from some limited directions because they reflect light from directions for which the radiances are much higher than those of the backgrounds against which they are viewed. The reflective patterns seen, for example, by neighbouring squid when schooling depend on the orientation of the squid in the external light field and the position of the squid relative to these neighbours.\n      "},{"title":"Cuttlefish camouflage: visual perception of size, contrast and number of white squares on artificial checkerboard substrata initiates disruptive coloration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2119","abstract":"\n        We investigated some visual background features that influence young cuttlefish, Sepia pharaonis, to change their skin patterning from ‘general resemblance’ of the substratum to disruptive coloration that breaks up their body form.

Second, given the appropriate size of checker, cuttlefish regulated their disruptive skin patterns according to the contrast between white and black squares. Third, by manipulating the number of white squares on a black background, we found that as few as four white squares among 316 black squares (or 1.25%) produced disruptive patterning, yet increasing the number of white squares to 20, 40 or 80 did not increase the frequency of appearance of the cuttlefish ‘white square’, but only its clarity of expression.

Levels of BDNF mRNA in the thecal layer and of trkB mRNA within the granulosa cell layer increase coincident with entrance of the follicle into the preovulatory hierarchy. Localization of the BDNF mRNA transcript correlates with expression of BDNF protein within the theca interna of preovulatory follicles, while localization of trkB mRNA and protein occurs extensively within the granulosa cell layer of preovulatory follicles. This pattern of expression suggests a paracrine relationship between theca and granulosa cells for BDNF signaling via TrkB. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and gonadotropin treatments stimulate increases in levels of trkB mRNA within cultured granulosa cells derived from both prehierarchal and preovulatory follicles, and this response is increased by co-treatment with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Finally, BDNF treatment of cultured granulosa cells from preovulatory follicles results in a modest, but significant, reduction in basal progesterone production, whereas this effect was reversed by k252a, an inhibitor of Trk kinase activity. These results support the proposals that BDNF functions as a paracrine signal in hen granulosa cells and that its physiological functions may include the modulation of steroidogenesis.\n      "},{"title":"Heart rate as an indicator of oxygen consumption: influence of body condition in the king penguin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2133","abstract":"\n        The use of heart rate to estimate field metabolic rate has become a more widely used technique. However, this method also has some limitations, among which is the possible impact that several variables such as sex, body condition (i.e. body fat stores) and/or inactivity might have on the relationship between heart rate and rate of oxygen consumption. In the present study, we investigate the extent to which body condition can affect the use of heart rate as an indicator of the rate of oxygen consumption.\n      \n        Twenty-two breeding king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) were exercised on a variable-speed treadmill. These birds were allocated to four groups according to their sex and whether or not they had been fasting. Linear regression equations were used to describe the relationship between heart rate and the rate of oxygen consumption for each group. There were significant differences between the regression equations for the four groups.\n      \n        Good relationships were obtained between resting and active oxygen pulses and an index of the body condition of the birds. Validation experiments on six courting king penguins showed that the use of a combination of resting oxygen pulse and active oxygen pulse gave the best estimate of the rate of oxygen consumption V̇O2. The mean percentage error between predicted and measured V̇O2 was only +0.81% for the six birds.\n      \n        We conclude that heart rate can be used to estimate rate of oxygen consumption in free-ranging king penguins even over a small time scale (30min). However, (i) the type of activity of the bird must be known and (ii) the body condition of the bird must be accurately determined. More investigations on the impact of fasting and/or inactivity on this relationship are required to refine these estimates further.\n      "},{"title":"Redox state, reactive oxygen species and adaptive growth in colonial hydroids","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/1845","abstract":"\n        Colonial metazoans often encrust surfaces over which the food supply varies in time or space. In such an environment, adaptive colony development entails adjusting the timing and spacing of feeding structures and gastrovascular connections to correspond to this variable food supply. To investigate the possibility of such adaptive growth, within-colony differential feeding experiments were carried out using the hydroid Podocoryna carnea. Indeed, such colonies strongly exhibited adaptive growth, developing dense arrays of polyps (feeding structures) and gastrovascular connections in areas that were fed relative to areas that were starved, and this effect became more consistent over time. To investigate mechanisms of signaling between the food supply and colony development, measurements were taken of metabolic parameters that have been implicated in signal transduction in other systems, particularly redox state and levels of reactive oxygen species. Utilizing fluorescence microscopy of P. carnea cells in vivo, simultaneous measurements of redox state [using NAD(P)H] and hydrogen peroxide (using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate) were taken. Both measures focused on polyp epitheliomuscular cells, since these exhibit the greatest metabolic activity. Colonies 3–5h after feeding were relatively oxidized, with low levels of peroxide, while colonies 24h after feeding were relatively reduced, with high levels of peroxide. The functional role of polyps in feeding and generating gastrovascular flow probably produced this dichotomy. Polyps 3–5h after feeding contract maximally, and this metabolic demand probably shifts the redox state in the direction of oxidation and diminishes levels of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, 24h after feeding, polyps are quiescent, and this lack of metabolic demand probably shifts the redox state in the direction of reduction and increases levels of reactive oxygen species. Within-colony differential feeding experiments were carried out on colonies 24h after the usual, colony-wide feeding. At this time, a single polyp was fed, and this polyp was compared with an otherwise similar polyp from the same colony. A pattern similar to the whole-colony experiments was obtained: the just-fed polyp, as it begins contracting shortly after feeding, appears to be relatively oxidized, with low levels of peroxide compared with the polyp that was not fed. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that adaptive colony development in response to a variable food supply is mediated by redox state or reactive oxygen species or both, although alternative hypotheses are also discussed.\n      "},{"title":"Effects of temperature and aquatic PO2 on the physiology and behaviour of Apalone ferox and Chrysemys picta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2185","abstract":"\n        Softshell turtles overwinter in the same bodies of water as some emydids, but their reduced shell and increased non-pulmonary gas exchange may contribute to a different mechanism of overwintering. The dynamics of bimodal respiration, diving behaviour and blood acid–base status in Apalone ferox and Chrysemys picta were investigated under two different temperatures combined with three different aquatic PO2 levels. Both species obtained oxygen through pulmonary and non-pulmonary routes. Apalone ferox obtained more oxygen through non-pulmonary routes and increased its non-pulmonary V̇.O2 in response to both higher aquatic PO2 and lower temperatures. Both species increased pulmonary V̇.O2 in response to higher temperatures. As a consequence of the greater reliance of A. ferox on pulmonary V̇.O2, warmer temperatures caused plasma PCO2 and [HCO3−1] values to increase significantly compared with C. picta. Apalone ferox, which is efficient at bimodal respiration, displayed a high degree of plasticity with respect to both its respiratory and acid–base profiles, behaving more like an aquatic air-breathing fish in bimodal respiration at low temperature and more like a terrestrial air-breather at high temperature. Chrysemys picta, which is poor at bimodal respiration, was highly dependent on aerial gas exchange at both temperatures. Aquatic PO2 did not change any of the behavioural variables measured. At warm temperatures, A. ferox met O2 demands by increasing the rate of lung ventilation, which resulted in a significantly greater number of breathing bouts per hour and breaths per emersion period. However, the number of breaths per bout was not affected by temperature. As temperatures decreased, A. ferox utilized its non-pulmonary respiration ability and significantly increased its dive duration. Apalone ferox became less active at colder temperatures by significantly increasing the duration of inactive periods (from 4 to 18min) and by significantly decreasing the frequency of activity bursts. Chrysemys picta also met the higher gas-exchange demands associated with increased temperature by increasing the rate of lung ventilation; however, this increase was not as large as that measured in A. ferox. Chrysemys picta displayed multiple rhythmic breaths per bout. These results indicate that, unlike aquatic PO2, temperature is an important factor in the regulation of diving and ventilatory behaviour in turtles. The species responded to temperature in dissimilar ways because of differences in their bimodal respiration ability.\n      "},{"title":"The Vortex Wake of the Free-swimming Larva and Pupa of CULEX PIPIENS (Diptera)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/1855","abstract":"\n        The kinematics and hydrodynamics of free-swimming pupal and larval (final-instar) culicids were investigated using videography and a simple wake-visualisation technique (dyes). In both cases, swimming is based on a technique of high-amplitude, side-to-side (larva) or up-and-down (pupa) bending of the body. The pupa possesses a pair of plate-like abdominal paddles; the larval abdominal paddle consists of a fan of closely spaced bristles which, at the Reynolds numbers involved, behaves like a continuous surface. Wake visualisation showed that each half-stroke of the swimming cycle produces a discrete ring vortex that is convected away from the body.\n      \n        Consecutive vortices are produced first to one side then to the other of the mean swimming path, the convection axis being inclined at approximately 25° away from dead aft. Pupal and larval culicids therefore resemble fish in using the momentum injected into the water to generate thrust. Preliminary calculations for the pupa suggest that each vortex contains sufficient momentum to account for that added to the body with each half-stroke.

Expression of Hsp70 protein and hsp70 mRNA is likewise reduced and has slower kinetics in this strain (T) than in a standard wild-type strain (Oregon R). These strains also differed in constitutive and heat-inducible levels of other molecular chaperones. The lower Hsp70 expression in the T strain apparently has no basis in the activation of the heat-shock transcription factor HSF, which is similar in T and Oregon R flies. Rather, the reduced expression may stem from insertion of two transposable elements, H.M.S. Beagle in the intergenic region of the 87A7 hsp70 gene cluster and Jockey in the hsp70Ba gene promoter.

The yolk-ball preparation consists of the yolk and the covering yolk-sac membrane, which contains a rich population of chloride cells. After appropriate cutting, the incision on the yolk ball healed during incubation in balanced salt solution for 3h, so that the yolk-sac membrane completely enclosed the yolk. Yolk balls prepared from freshwater-acclimated embryos were transferred either to fresh water or to sea water and incubated for 48 and 96h to elucidate the morphological changes in the chloride cells in response to environmental salinity. The chloride cells in the yolk-sac membrane were larger in sea water than in fresh water. In yolk balls transferred to sea water, chloride cells often formed multicellular complexes characteristic of seawater-type chloride cells. In those transferred to fresh water, however, the cells were small and rarely formed such complexes. These responses of chloride cells were identical to those observed in intact embryos. Thus, chloride cells in the yolk-sac membrane could differentiate into the seawater type independent of the embryonic body. To examine the possible effects of exogenous cortisol on chloride cell differentiation, the yolk balls were incubated for 48h in fresh water or sea water containing different doses of cortisol (0.1–10μgml−1). Although chloride cells were consistently larger in sea water than in fresh water in all experimental groups, cortisol administration had no effect on chloride cell surface area in either medium. These findings indicate that the chloride cells in the yolk-sac membrane are equipped with an autonomous mechanism of functional differentiation that is independent of the embryonic endocrine and nervous systems. The yolk-ball incubation system established here is an excellent experimental model for further studies on chloride cell differentiation and function.\n      "},{"title":"Synthesis of the Signal Molecule Acetylcholine during the Developmental Cycle of PARAMECIUM PRIMAURELIA (Protista, Ciliophora) and its Possible Function in Conjugation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/1901","abstract":"\n        We recently discovered, in mating-competent Paramecium primaurelia, the presence of functionally related molecules of the cholinergic system: the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), both its nicotinic and muscarinic receptors and its lytic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Our results on the inhibition of mating-cell pairing in vivo in mating-competent cells treated with cholinomimetic drugs support the hypothesis that the cholinergic system plays a role in cell-to-cell adhesion. To investigate the possible function of the signal molecule ACh in conjugation in P. primaurelia, we attempted to detect the intracellular sites of ACh synthesis by localizing the ACh biosynthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Using immunocytochemical and histochemical methods, we have demonstrated the presence and activity of ChAT principally on the surface membrane of mating-competent cells and of mature but non-mating-competent cells. No evidence for ChAT activity was found in immature cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of immunoreactive bands, ranging in molecular mass from 42 to 133kDa, as reported for ChAT isolated from higher organisms. In vivo experiments showed that inhibition of ChAT activity by Congo Red, known to be a potent competitive inhibitor of acetyl coenzyme A, did not affect mating-cell pairing. Conversely, inhibition of AChE with BW284c51 or eserine, which block enzyme activity by reacting with a specific serine within the catalytic centre, significantly inhibited mating-cell pairing.

Cytochalasin D (5.0μmoll−1) completely blocked the conductance response to hypotonic shock and the reduction in apical crypt density measured by scanning electron microscopy, while phalloidin (33μmoll−1), colchicine (3×10−4moll−1) and griseofulvin (1.0μmoll−1) were ineffective. Actin imaging by phalloidin staining and confocal microscopy revealed extensive actin cords in pavement cell microridges and a ring of actin at the apex of chloride cells. We conclude that the actin cytoskeleton of chloride cells is required to maintain crypt opening and that osmotic shock causes chloride cells to adjust their apical crypt size.\n      "},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/1925","abstract":"\n        Laboratory mice (strain MF1) were used to determine whether sustainable rates of energy intake are limited during lactation. Mice raising natural-sized litters (N=71) reached an asymptote in their daily food intake between days 13 and 16 of lactation at 23.1gday−1 and also between litter sizes of 9 and 15 pups (22.8gday−1). A second group of 37 females had their litter sizes manipulated at birth to raise more or fewer offspring than they gave birth to. When the litter size was increased, females did not increase their food intake to match their new litter size. However, when litter size was decreased, females decreased their asymptotic daily food intake during late lactation in relation to the extent of reduction in litter size. Therefore, it appeared that females were limited during late lactation and with large litter sizes. The milk energy exported amounted to 44% of the gross energy intake, and the estimated daily energy expenditure was therefore considerably lower than the sustained energy intake [8.0×RMR(gross), 6.6×RMR(assimilated)], and averaged 3.1×RMR, where RMR is resting metabolic rate. It was not possible to determine whether the apparent limit on sustained energy intake was acting centrally or peripherally because of the asymptotes in both food intake and milk energy output with increasing litter size.\n      "},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/1937","abstract":"\n        Links between resting metabolic rate (RMR) and reproductive output have been previously sought at both inter- and intraspecific levels, but have only been found in some interspecific studies.

By manipulating the litter size of some females at birth, we aimed to establish the direction of causality in any correlation between litter size and RMR. Correlations between maternal morphology and RMR, litter size and litter mass were also examined. Neither pre-breeding RMR nor mass-independent pre-breeding RMR was correlated with litter size or litter mass. RMR at peak lactation, however, was positively correlated with litter size and negatively correlated with mean pup mass. After correcting for the effects of body mass, residual peak lactation RMR was not correlated with litter size or litter mass. Body size was the major morphological variable influencing litter mass, offspring mass and asymptotic food intake. Mammary tissue mass was correlated with litter size when only the data for mice raising unmanipulated litters were used. RMR at peak lactation was significantly related to the principal component of morphology dominated by carcass mass. This study confirms the findings of previous intraspecific and some interspecific studies that found no correlation between RMR and reproductive output after the effects of body mass had been removed.\n      "},{"title":"Arginine Vasotocin Modulates a Sexually Dimorphic Communication Behavior in the Weakly Electric fish APTERONOTUS LEPTORHYNCHUS","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/1909","abstract":"\n        South American weakly electric fish produce a variety of electric organ discharge (EOD) amplitude and frequency modulations including chirps or rapid increases in EOD frequency that function as agonistic and courtship and mating displays. In Apteronotus leptorhynchus, chirps are readily evoked by the presence of the EOD of a conspecific or a sinusoidal signal designed to mimic another EOD, and we found that the frequency difference between the discharge of a given animal and that of an EOD mimic is important in determining which of two categories of chirp an animal will produce. Type-I chirps (EOD frequency increases averaging 650Hz and lasting approximately 25ms) are preferentially produced by males in response to EOD mimics with a frequency of 50–200Hz higher or lower than that of their own. The EOD frequency of Apteronotus leptorhynchus is sexually dimorphic: female EODs range from 600 to 800Hz and male EODs range from 800 to 1000Hz. Hence, EOD frequency differences effective in evoking type-I chirps are most likely to occur during male/female interactions. This result supports previous observations that type-I chirps are emitted most often during courtship and mating. Type-II chirps, which consist of shorter-duration frequency increases of approximately 100Hz, occur preferentially in response to EOD mimics that differ from the EOD of the animal by 10–15Hz. Hence these are preferentially evoked when animals of the same sex interact and, as previously suggested, probably represent agonistic displays. Females typically produced only type-II chirps. We also investigated the effects of arginine vasotocin on chirping. This peptide is known to modulate communication and other types of behavior in many species, and we found that arginine vasotocin decreased the production of type-II chirps by males and also increased the production of type-I chirps in a subset of males. The chirping of most females was not significantly affected by arginine vasotocin.\n      "},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/1967","abstract":"\n        We have previously observed that female MF1 mice appeared to reach a limit in their food intake and milk production during late lactation, reaching a plateau between days 13 and 16 of lactation and between litter sizes of 9 and 15. These mice did not increase their food intake when forced to raise more offspring or when manipulated to be concurrently pregnant during late lactation, yet they did eat significantly more food at the peak of their second sequential lactation or when challenged with food of reduced energy content. These data suggest that apparent limits on sustained energy intake in this strain may not reflect central limitations but rather peripheral constraints at the mammary glands. In this study, we aimed to determine whether these were indeed limits by increasing the demands on the females during late lactation by cold-exposure (8°C). Females responded to this manipulation by significantly increasing their food intake (F1,73=77.53, P<0.001) above that of lactating females kept in warmer conditions (21°C). In addition, there was a significant reduction in the number of pups raised in the cold (t=2.36, d.f.=18, P=0.03), with the majority of the mortality occurring within the first 2 days of cold-exposure. The mean mass of the pups raised in the cold was significantly lower (F1,74=13.8, P<0.001) than that of those raised in the warm. Despite the cold-exposure and the increased food intake, there was no difference in the resting metabolic rates of the two groups of mothers or in the lengths of their small intestine. The greater food intake of lactating mice during cold-exposure supported our previous observations that they were capable of eating more food than the previously suggested limit of 23.1gday−1. However, the milk energy output of females in the cold was also significantly higher than in the warm (F1,15=11.99, P=0.003), indicating that the asymptotic food intake of females in the warm was not mediated by limitations in their milk production. Sustained energy intake in these mice does not appear to be centrally or peripherally limited. Rather, the mice may restrain their use of energy during their first lactation because of life-history consequences for future reproductive attempts.\n      "},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/1947","abstract":"\n        To determine whether mice were limited in their capacity to absorb energy during late lactation, we attempted to increase the energy burden experienced by a group of female mice during late lactation by mating them at the postpartum oestrus, hence combining the energy demands of pregnancy and lactation. These experimental mice were therefore concurrently pregnant and lactating in their first lactation, and were followed through a normal second lactation. In a control group, females also underwent two lactations but sequentially, with the second mating after the first litter had been weaned. Maternal mass and food intake were measured throughout the first lactation, second pregnancy and second lactation. Maternal resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured prior to the first mating and then at the peak of both the first and second lactations. Litter size and litter mass were also measured throughout both lactations. In the first lactation, experimental mice had a lower mass-independent RMR (F1,88=5.15, P=0.026) and raised significantly heavier pups (t=2.77, d.f.=32, P=0.0093) than the control mice. Experimental mice delayed implantation at the start of the second pregnancy. The extent of the delay was positively related to litter size during the first lactation (F1,19=4.58, P=0.046) and negatively related to mean pup mass (F1,19=5.78, P=0.027) in the first lactation. In the second lactation, the experimental mice gave birth to more (t=2.75, d.f.=38, P=0.0092) and lighter (t=−5.01, d.f.=38, P<0.0001) pups than did the controls in their second lactation. Maternal asymptotic daily food intake of control mice in the second lactation was significantly higher (t=−4.39, d.f.=37, P=0.0001) than that of the experimental mice and higher than that of controls during their first lactation. Despite the added burden on the experimental females during their first lactation, there was no increase in their food intake, which suggested that they might be limited by their capacity to absorb energy. However, control females appeared to be capable of increasing their asymptotic food intake beyond the supposed limits estimated previously, suggesting that the previously established limit was not a fixed central limitation on food intake. As RMR increased in parallel with the increase in food intake during the second lactation of control mice, the sustained energy intake remained at around 7.0×RMR.\n      "},{"title":"Hovering Performance of Hummingbirds in Hyperoxic Gas Mixtures","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/2021","abstract":"\n        Hummingbirds evolved during a period of decline in atmospheric oxygen concentration and currently encounter varying levels of oxygen availability along their elevational distribution. We tested the hypothesis that inspiration of hyperoxic gas increases hummingbird hovering performance when birds are simultaneously challenged aerodynamically. We measured the maximum duration of hovering flight while simultaneously monitoring the rate of oxygen consumption of ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) in low-density heliox that was either normoxic (21% O2) or hyperoxic (35% O2). As air density decreased below 0.85kgm−3, hummingbirds hovered significantly longer in hyperoxia than in normoxia, but the air density at which the birds could no longer sustain hovering flight was independent of oxygen concentration. At low air densities in hyperoxia flight trials, hummingbirds appeared to increase their rate of oxygen consumption relative to flight sequences at equivalent densities in normoxia trials, but these differences were not significant. We tested the hypothesis that hummingbirds can discriminate between environments that differ in oxygen concentration. In another density-reduction experiment, hummingbirds were allowed to choose between artificial feeders infused with either normoxic or hyperoxic gases. The hypothesis was not supported because birds failed to associate oxygen concentration with a particular feeder independently of air density. Supplemental oxygen thus yields increased hovering duration at intermediate air densities, but the minimum density at which birds can fly is limited exclusively by aerodynamic considerations.\n      "},{"title":"Comparative Analysis of Autoxidation of Haemoglobin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/2029","abstract":"\n        Autoxidation of oxyhaemoglobin (oxyHb) to methaemoglobin was measured at different temperatures in haemoglobin solutions from Atlantic hagfish, river lamprey, common carp, yellowfin tuna and pig. The aims were to evaluate the impact of the absent distal histidine in hagfish haemoglobin, the importance of oxyHb being either monomeric (hagfish and lamprey) or tetrameric (carp, tuna and pig) and to gain information on the temperature-sensitivity of autoxidation. The rate of autoxidation was lower in hagfish than in carp, yellowfin tuna and lamprey haemoglobins at any given temperature. Substitution of the distal histidine residue (His E7) with glutamine in hagfish haemoglobin was therefore not associated with an accelerated autoxidation, as might be expected on the basis of the normal protective role of His E7. Glutamine may have similar qualities to histidine and be involved in the low susceptibility to autoxidation. The low oxidation rate of hagfish haemoglobin, together with an oxidation rate of lamprey haemoglobin that did not differ from that of carp and yellowfin tuna haemoglobins, also revealed that autoxidation was not accelerated in the monomeric oxyhaemoglobins. Pig haemoglobin was oxidised more slowly than fish haemoglobins, demonstrating that fish haemoglobins are more sensitive to autoxidation than mammalian haemoglobins. The rate of autoxidation of hagfish haemoglobin was, however, only significantly greater than that of pig haemoglobin at high temperatures. Autoxidation was accelerated by rising temperature in all haemoglobins. Arrhenius plots of carp and yellowfin tuna haemoglobin revealed a break at 25°C, reflecting a lower temperature-sensitivity between 5 and 25°C than between 25 and 40°C.\n      "},{"title":"Twisting and Bending: The Functional Role of Salamander Lateral Hypaxial Musculature During Locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/1979","abstract":"\n        The function of the lateral hypaxial muscles during locomotion in tetrapods is controversial. Currently, there are two hypotheses of lateral hypaxial muscle function. The first, supported by electromyographic (EMG) data from a lizard (Iguana iguana) and a salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus), suggests that hypaxial muscles function to bend the body during swimming and to resist long-axis torsion during walking. The second, supported by EMG data from lizards during relatively high-speed locomotion, suggests that these muscles function primarily to bend the body during locomotion, not to resist torsional forces. To determine whether the results from D. ensatus hold for another salamander, we recorded lateral hypaxial muscle EMGs synchronized with body and limb kinematics in the tiger salamander Ambystoma tigrinum. In agreement with results from aquatic locomotion in D. ensatus, all four layers of lateral hypaxial musculature were found to show synchronous EMG activity during swimming in A. tigrinum. Our findings for terrestrial locomotion also agree with previous results from D. ensatus and support the torsion resistance hypothesis for terrestrial locomotion. We observed asynchronous EMG bursts of relatively high intensity in the lateral and medial pairs of hypaxial muscles during walking in tiger salamanders (we call these ‘α-bursts’). We infer from this pattern that the more lateral two layers of oblique hypaxial musculature, Mm. obliquus externus superficialis (OES) and obliquus externus profundus (OEP), are active on the side towards which the trunk is bending, while the more medial two layers, Mm. obliquus internus (OI) and transversus abdominis (TA), are active on the opposite side. This result is consistent with the hypothesis proposed for D. ensatus that the OES and OEP generate torsional moments to counteract ground reaction forces generated by forelimb support, while the OI and TA generate torsional moments to counteract ground reaction forces from hindlimb support. However, unlike the EMG pattern reported for D. ensatus, a second, lower-intensity burst of EMG activity (‘β-burst’) was sometimes recorded from the lateral hypaxial muscles in A. tigrinum. As seen in other muscle systems, these β-bursts of hypaxial muscle coactivation may function to provide fine motor control during locomotion. The presence of asynchronous, relatively high-intensity α-bursts indicates that the lateral hypaxial muscles generate torsional moments during terrestrial locomotion, but it is possible that the balance of forces from both α- and β-bursts may allow the lateral hypaxial muscles to contribute to lateral bending of the body as well.\n      "},{"title":"The Salivary Adenosine Deaminase Activity of the Mosquitoes Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/2001","abstract":"\n        A cDNA coding for a protein with significant similarity to adenosine deaminase (ADA) was found while randomly sequencing a cDNA library constructed from salivary gland extracts of adult female Culex quinquefasciatus. Prompted by this result, we found high ADA activities in two culicine mosquitoes, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti, but not in the anopheline Anopheles gambiae. Homogenates from Culex quinquefasciatus also have an AMP deaminase activity that is three times greater than the ADA activity, whereas in Aedes aegypti the AMP deaminase activity is less than 10% of the ADA activity. Evidence for secretion of ADA during blood feeding by Aedes aegypti includes the presence of ADA activity in warm solutions probed through a membrane by mosquitoes and in serotonin-induced saliva and a statistically significant reduction in the levels of the enzyme in Aedes aegypti following a blood meal. We could not demonstrate, however, that C. quinquefasciatus secrete ADA in their saliva. Male Aedes aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus, which do not feed on blood, have less than 3% of the levels of ADA found in females. We propose that ADA activity in A. aegypti may help blood feeding by removing adenosine, a molecule associated with both the initiation of pain perception and the induction of mast cell degranulation in vertebrates, and by producing inosine, a molecule that potently inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines. The role of salivary ADA in Culex quinquefasciatus remains unclear.\n      "},{"title":"Effects of Altitude and Temperature on Organ Phenotypic Plasticity Along an Altitudinal Gradient","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/1991","abstract":"\n        Small mammals living in high-altitude environments must endure decreased ambient temperatures and hypoxic conditions relative to sea-level environments. Previously, it was noted that heart, lung and digestive tract masses and blood hematocrit increase along an altitudinal gradient in small mammals. Increases in digestive organ mass were attributed to lower ambient temperatures and greater food intake, and increases in lung mass and hematocrit were attributed to hypoxia, but these assumptions were not explicitly tested. In addition, it was not clear whether changes in heart and lung mass were a function of an increase in organ blood content or of an increase in organ tissue mass. We used captive deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus sonoriensis) to determine the relative effects of ambient temperature and oxygen concentration (PO2) on organ mass and blood hematocrit along an altitudinal gradient. We also exsanguinated hearts and lungs to determine whether changes in mass were associated with the blood content or with increases in tissue mass. We found that small intestine mass was, as expected, correlated positively with energy intake and negatively with ambient temperature. Heart mass was also negatively correlated with temperature. Lung mass and hematocrit were, as expected, positively correlated with altitude (and PO2). Interestingly, the masses of both small intestine and kidney were negatively correlated with altitude. For kidney mass, this correlation was apparent in cold-exposed mice but not in warm-exposed mice. We also found that changes in both heart and lung mass were mainly a function of changes in tissue mass rather than blood content. These data show that different abiotic variables have different effects on organ masses at high altitude, but also that phenotypic plasticity in response to cold temperatures and low oxygen pressures at altitude is widespread across several different organ systems, suggesting a general elevated whole-body response.\n      "},{"title":"N-Acetylneuraminic Acid (NANA) Stimulates in situ cyclic AMP Production in Tentacles of Sea Anemone (Aiptasia pallida): Possible Role in Chemosensitization of Nematocyst Discharge","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/2011","abstract":"\n        Cnidocytes, the stinging cells of cnidarians, optimally discharge nematocysts in response to combined physical contact and stimulation of specific chemoreceptors. In the tentacles of certain sea anemones, the primary chemoreceptors bind N-acetylated sugars, such as N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA). Sensitization with NANA predisposes contact-sensitive mechanoreceptors (CSMs) to trigger discharge in response to physical contact. In the ectoderm of sea anemone tentacles, cnidocyte/supporting cell complexes (CSCCs) control and trigger nematocyst discharge. Previous findings have implicated cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a second messenger in NANA-sensitized nematocyst discharge. However, no reports have directly demonstrated that the cAMP content of tentacles changes in response to NANA stimulation. We now show that NANA elevates in situ cAMP levels in a dose-dependent manner in the ectoderm of tentacles from the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida. However, the endoderm of tentacles shows no detectable cAMP response to NANA. The effect of NANA on the cAMP content of the ectoderm is biphasic. Micromolar NANA increases the in situ cAMP level, with a maximal response occurring at 1.8×10−5moll−1 NANA. At higher NANA concentrations, the cAMP content decreases to that of controls. Because the cAMP dose/response curve to NANA coincides precisely with the dose/response curves of NANA-sensitized nematocyst discharge and nematocyst-mediated adhesive force, a second-messenger role for cAMP in NANA-sensitized nematocyst discharge is strongly suggested. The addition of isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to the medium with sea anemones increases tissue cAMP levels both in the absence and in the presence of NANA. However, anesthetizing anemones in sea water containing high levels of Mg2+ blocks the NANA-stimulated cAMP response of the ectoderm. In addition, our results suggest that NANA-stimulated cAMP may activate endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in broken cell preparations of tentacles. Thus, NANA-stimulated cAMP may function as a second messenger in the NANA chemosensory signaling pathway controlling nematocyst discharge.\n      "},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/11/1957","abstract":"\n        Observations were made on 30 MF1 mice with their litters. The animals were fed either normal pelleted mouse food (SDS BP Nutrition Ltd) containing 13.4kJg−1 digestible energy or a specially formulated diet that provided 25% less digestible energy (9.75kJg−1) but equivalent amounts of protein and essential minerals and vitamins per gram as the normal diet. Half the animals were switched to the low-energy diet during early pregnancy and half after parturition. The food intake of the two groups increased enormously following parturition, reaching an asymptote over the last few days of lactation. In both groups, the asymptotic food intake exceeded that previously observed across 71 litters of this strain of mice fed the normal diet throughout pregnancy and lactation; the intake of the group fed the low-energy diet from early lactation significantly exceeded that of the mice switched to the low-energy diet after parturition. The increased intakes of the experimental groups were, however, insufficient to offset the lower digestible energy content of the food during lactation. The body mass of the mothers at the end of lactation did not differ between the two experimental groups and the controls. Offspring mass at weaning was inversely related to litter size, but also did not differ between the three groups; pup mortality did not differ between the experimental and control groups. Behavioural observations showed that during both the dark and light phases the general activity of the mother declined enormously from early pregnancy to late lactation. In the dark phase, the time spent in general activity was replaced by time spent both feeding and resting (suckling young), but in the light phase it was replaced only by feeding. At peak lactation, the mice fed for 30–50% of the dark phase and for 30–40% of the light phase. The data indicate that a previously observed asymptote in food intake during peak lactation at 23gday−1 is unlikely to be a limit mediated centrally by the alimentary tract. A higher central limit may exist, at 26.9gday−1, but this is unlikely to reflect the time available for feeding. The data are consistent with limits on sustainable daily energy intake being mediated by the performance of the mammary glands. Animals appeared to accommodate the demands for milk production within a constrained total energy budget by compensating their behaviour, most notably by reductions in the time spent in ‘general activity’.\n      "}]
