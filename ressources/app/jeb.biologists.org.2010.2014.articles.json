[{"title":"The energetic benefits of tendon springs in running: is the reduction of muscle work important?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4365","abstract":"The distal muscle-tendon units of cursorial species are commonly composed of short muscle fibres and long, compliant tendons. It is assumed that the ability of these tendons to store and return mechanical energy over the course of a stride, thus avoiding the cyclic absorption and regeneration of mechanical energy by active muscle, offers some metabolic energy savings during running. However, this assumption has not been tested directly. We used muscle ergometry and myothermic measurements to determine the cost of force production in muscles acting isometrically, as they could if mechanical energy was stored and returned by tendon, and undergoing active stretch–shorten cycles, as they would if mechanical energy was absorbed and regenerated by muscle. We found no detectable difference in the cost of force production in isometric cycles compared with stretch–shorten cycles. This result suggests that replacing muscle stretch–shorten work with tendon elastic energy storage and recovery does not reduce the cost of force production. This calls into question the assumption that reduction of muscle work drove the evolution of long distal tendons. We propose that the energetic benefits of tendons are derived primarily from their effect on muscle and limb architecture rather than their ability to reduce the cyclic work of muscle."},{"title":"Total body water and water turnover rates in the estuarine diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) during the transition from dormancy to activity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4406","abstract":"Water and salt concentrations in an animal's body fluids can fluctuate with changing environmental conditions, posing osmoregulatory challenges that require behavioral and physiological adjustments. The purpose of this study was to investigate body water dynamics in the estuarine diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), a species that undergoes seasonal dormancy in salt marsh habitats. We conducted a field study to determine the total body water (%TBW), water turnover rate (WTR) and daily water flux (DWF) of female terrapins in south eastern North Carolina pre- and post-emergence from winter dormancy. Terrapins were injected with [2H]deuterium on two occasions and washout of the isotope was monitored by taking successive blood samples during the period of transition from dormancy to activity. The WTR and DWF of dormant terrapins were significantly lower than those of active terrapins (WTRdormant=49.70±15.94 ml day–1, WTRactive=100.20±20.36 ml day–1, DWFdormant=10.52±2.92%TBW day–1, DWFactive =21.84±7.30%TBW day–1). There was no significant difference in %TBW between dormant and active terrapins (75.05±6.19% and 74.54±4.36%, respectively). The results from this field study provide insight into the terrapin's ability to maintain osmotic homeostasis while experiencing shifts in behavioral and environmental conditions."},{"title":"The mechanics of elastic loading and recoil in anuran jumping","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4372","abstract":"Many animals use catapult mechanisms to produce extremely rapid movements for escape or prey capture, resulting in power outputs far beyond the limits of muscle. In these catapults, muscle contraction loads elastic structures, which then recoil to release the stored energy extremely rapidly. Many arthropods employ anatomical ‘catch mechanisms’ to lock the joint in place during the loading period, which can then be released to allow joint motion via elastic recoil. Jumping vertebrates lack a clear anatomical catch, yet face the same requirement to load the elastic structure prior to movement. There are several potential mechanisms to allow loading of vertebrate elastic structures, including the gravitational load of the body, a variable mechanical advantage, and moments generated by the musculature of proximal joints. To test these hypothesized mechanisms, we collected simultaneous 3D kinematics via X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM) and single-foot forces during the jumps of three Rana pipiens. We calculated joint mechanical advantage, moment and power using inverse dynamics at the ankle, knee, hip and ilio-sacral joints. We found that the increasing proximal joint moments early in the jump allowed for high ankle muscle forces and elastic pre-loading, and the subsequent reduction in these moments allowed the ankle to extend using elastic recoil. Mechanical advantage also changed throughout the jump, with the muscle contracting against a poor mechanical advantage early in the jump during loading and a higher mechanical advantage late in the jump during recoil. These ‘dynamic catch mechanisms’ serve to resist joint motion during elastic loading, then allow it during elastic recoil, functioning as a catch mechanism based on the balance and orientation of forces throughout the limb rather than an anatomical catch."},{"title":"Metabolism and water loss rate of the haematophagous insect Rhodnius prolixus: effect of starvation and temperature","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4414","abstract":"Haematophagous insects suffer big changes in water needs under different levels of starvation. Rhodnius prolixus is the most important haematophagous vector of Chagas disease in the north of South America and a model organism in insect physiology. Although there have been some studies on patterns of gas exchange and metabolic rates, there is little information regarding water loss in R. prolixus. We investigated whether there is any modulation of water loss and metabolic rate under different requirements for saving water. We measured simultaneously CO2 production, water emission and activity in individual insects in real time by open-flow respirometry at different temperatures (15, 25 and 35°C) and post-feeding days (0, 5, 13 and 29). We found: (1) a clear drop in metabolic rate between 5 and 13 days after feeding that cannot be explained by activity and (2) a decrease in water loss rate with increasing starvation level, by a decrease in cuticular water loss during the first 5 days after feeding and a drop in the respiratory component thereafter. We calculated the surface area of the insects and estimated cuticular permeability. In addition, we analysed the pattern of gas exchange; the change from a cyclic to a continuous pattern was affected by temperature and activity, but it was not affected by the level of starvation. Modulation of metabolic and water loss rates with temperature and starvation could help R. prolixus to be more flexible in tolerating different periods of starvation, which is adaptive in a changing environment with the uncertainty of finding a suitable host."},{"title":"Antioxidant defence and stress protein induction following heat stress in the Mediterranean snail Xeropicta derbentina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4399","abstract":"The Mediterranean snail Xeropicta derbentina (Pulmonata, Hygromiidae), being highly abundant in Southern France, has the need for efficient physiological adaptations to desiccation and over-heating posed by dry and hot environmental conditions. As a consequence of heat, oxidative stress manifests in these organisms, which, in turn, leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we focused on adaptations at the biochemical level by investigation of antioxidant defences and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) induction, both essential mechanisms of the heat stress response. We exposed snails to elevated temperature (25, 38, 40, 43 and 45°C) in the laboratory and measured the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), determined the Hsp70 level and quantified lipid peroxidation. In general, we found a high constitutive level of CAT activity in all treatments, which may be interpreted as a permanent protection against ROS, i.e. hydrogen peroxide. CAT and GPx showed temperature-dependent activity: CAT activity was significantly increased in response to high temperatures (43 and 45°C), whereas GPx exhibited a significantly increased activity at 40°C, probably in response to high levels of lipid peroxides that occurred in the 38°C treatment. Hsp70 showed a maximum induction at 40°C, followed by a decrease at higher temperatures. Our results reveal that X. derbentina possesses a set of efficient mechanisms to cope with the damaging effects of heat. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, besides the well-documented Hsp70 stress response, antioxidant defence plays a crucial role in the snails' competence to survive extreme temperatures."},{"title":"Geographic variation in thermal physiological performance of the intertidal crab Petrolisthes violaceus along a latitudinal gradient","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4379","abstract":"Environmental temperature has profound effects on the biological performance and biogeographical distribution of ectothermic species. Variation of this abiotic factor across geographic gradients is expected to produce physiological differentiation and local adaptation of natural populations depending on their thermal tolerances and physiological sensitivities. Here, we studied geographic variation in whole-organism thermal physiology of seven populations of the porcelain crab Petrolisthes violaceus across a latitudinal gradient of 3000 km, characterized by a cline of thermal conditions. Our study found that populations of P. violaceus show no differences in the limits of their thermal performance curves and demonstrate a negative correlation of their optimal temperatures with latitude. Additionally, our findings show that high-latitude populations of P. violaceus exhibit broader thermal tolerances, which is consistent with the climatic variability hypothesis. Interestingly, under a future scenario of warming oceans, the thermal safety margins of P. violaceus indicate that lower latitude populations can physiologically tolerate the ocean-warming scenarios projected by the IPCC for the end of the twenty-first century."},{"title":"Bats coordinate sonar and flight behavior as they forage in open and cluttered environments","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4356","abstract":"Echolocating bats use active sensing as they emit sounds and listen to the returning echoes to probe their environment for navigation, obstacle avoidance and pursuit of prey. The sensing behavior of bats includes the planning of 3D spatial trajectory paths, which are guided by echo information. In this study, we examined the relationship between active sonar sampling and flight motor output as bats changed environments from open space to an artificial forest in a laboratory flight room. Using high-speed video and audio recordings, we reconstructed and analyzed 3D flight trajectories, sonar beam aim and acoustic sonar emission patterns as the bats captured prey. We found that big brown bats adjusted their sonar call structure, temporal patterning and flight speed in response to environmental change. The sonar beam aim of the bats predicted the flight turn rate in both the open room and the forest. However, the relationship between sonar beam aim and turn rate changed in the forest during the final stage of prey pursuit, during which the bat made shallower turns. We found flight stereotypy developed over multiple days in the forest, but did not find evidence for a reduction in active sonar sampling with experience. The temporal patterning of sonar sound groups was related to path planning around obstacles in the forest. Together, these results contribute to our understanding of how bats coordinate echolocation and flight behavior to represent and navigate their environment."},{"title":"Nitric oxide modulates a swimmeret beating rhythm in the crayfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4423","abstract":"The modulatory effects of nitric oxide (NO) and cAMP on the rhythmic beating activity of the swimmeret motor neurones in the crayfish were examined. Swimmerets are paired appendages located on the ventral side of each abdominal segment that show rhythmic beating activity during forward swimming, postural righting behaviour and egg ventilation in gravid females. In isolated abdominal nerve cord preparations, swimmeret motor neurones are usually silent or show a continuous low-frequency spiking activity. Application of carbachol, a cholinergic agonist, elicited rhythmic bursts of motor neurone spikes. The co-application of l-arginine, the substrate for NO synthesis with carbachol increased the burst frequency of the motor neurones. The co-application of the NO donor SNAP with carbachol also increased the burst frequency of the motor neurones. By contrast, co-application of a NOS inhibitor, l-NAME, with carbachol decreased beating frequency of the motor neurones. These results indicate that NO may act as a neuromodulator to facilitate swimmeret beating activity. The facilitatory effect of l-arginine was cancelled by co-application of the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor ODQ suggesting that NO acts by activating sGC to promote the production of cGMP. Application of l-arginine alone or membrane-permeable cGMP analogue 8-Br-cGMP alone did not elicit rhythmic activity of motor neurones, but co-application of 8-Br-cGMP with carbachol increased bursting frequency of the motor neurones. Furthermore, application of the membrane-permeable cAMP analogue CPT-cAMP alone produced rhythmic bursting of swimmeret motor neurones, and the bursting frequency elicited by CPT-cAMP was increased by co-application with l-arginine. Co-application of the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 ceased rhythmic bursts of motor neurone spikes elicited by carbachol. These results suggest that a cAMP system enables the rhythmic bursts of motor neurone spikes and that a NO–cGMP signaling pathway increases cAMP activity to facilitate swimmeret beating."},{"title":"Reliable quantification of bite-force performance requires use of appropriate biting substrate and standardization of bite out-lever","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4303","abstract":"Bite-force performance is an ecologically important measure of whole-organism performance that shapes dietary breadth and feeding strategies and, in some taxa, determines reproductive success. It also is a metric that is crucial to testing and evaluating biomechanical models. We reviewed nearly 100 published studies of a range of taxa that incorporate direct in vivo measurements of bite force. Problematically, methods of data collection and processing vary considerably among studies. In particular, there is little consensus on the appropriate substrate to use on the biting surface of force transducers. In addition, the bite out-lever, defined as the distance from the fulcrum (i.e. jaw joint) to the position along the jawline at which the jaws engage the transducer, is rarely taken into account. We examined the effect of bite substrate and bite out-lever on bite-force estimates in a diverse sample of lizards. Results indicate that both variables have a significant impact on the accuracy of measurements. Maximum bite force is significantly greater using leather as the biting substrate compared with a metal substrate. Less-forceful bites on metal are likely due to inhibitory feedback from mechanoreceptors that prevent damage to the feeding apparatus. Standardization of bite out-lever affected which trial produced maximum performance for a given individual. Indeed, maximum bite force is usually underestimated without standardization because it is expected to be greatest at the minimum out-lever (i.e. back of the jaws), which in studies is rarely targeted with success. We assert that future studies should use a pliable substrate, such as leather, and use appropriate standardization for bite out-lever."},{"title":"Sound production in Onuxodon fowleri (Carapidae) and its amplification by the host shell","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4283","abstract":"Onuxodon species are well known for living inside pearl oysters. As in other carapids, their anatomy highlights their ability to make sounds but sound production has never been documented in Onuxodon. This paper describes sound production in Onuxodon fowleri as well as the anatomy of the sound production apparatus. Single-pulsed sounds and multiple-pulsed sounds that sometimes last more than 3 s were recorded in the field and in captivity (Makemo Island, French Polynesia). These pulses are characterized by a broadband frequency spectrum from 100 to 1000 Hz. Onuxodon fowleri is mainly characterized by its ability to modulate the pulse period, meaning that this species can produce pulsed sounds and tonal-like sounds using the same mechanism. In addition, the sound can be remarkably amplified by the shell cavity (peak gain can exceed 10 dB for some frequencies). The sonic apparatus of O. fowleri is characterized by a rocker bone in front of the swimbladder, modified vertebrae and epineurals, and two pairs of sonic muscles, one of which (primary sonic muscle) inserts on the rocker bone. The latter structure, which is absent in other carapid genera, appears to be sexually dimorphic suggesting differences in sound production in males and females. Sound production in O. fowleri could be an example of adaptation where an animal exploits features of its environment to enhance communication."},{"title":"Supervised accelerometry analysis can identify prey capture by penguins at sea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4295","abstract":"Determining where, when and how much animals eat is fundamental to understanding their ecology. We developed a technique to identify a prey capture signature for little penguins from accelerometry, in order to quantify food intake remotely. We categorised behaviour of captive penguins from HD video and matched this to time-series data from back-mounted accelerometers. We then trained a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the penguins' behaviour at 0.3 s intervals as either ‘prey handling’ or ‘swimming’. We applied this model to accelerometer data collected from foraging wild penguins to identify prey capture events. We compared prey capture and non-prey capture dives to test the model predictions against foraging theory. The SVM had an accuracy of 84.95±0.26% (mean ± s.e.) and a false positive rate of 9.82±0.24% when tested on unseen captive data. For wild data, we defined three independent, consecutive prey handling observations as representing true prey capture, with a false positive rate of 0.09%. Dives with prey captures had longer duration and bottom times, were deeper, had faster ascent rates, and had more ‘wiggles’ and ‘dashes’ (proxies for prey encounter used in other studies). The mean (±s.e.) number of prey captures per foraging trip was 446.6±66.28. By recording the behaviour of captive animals on HD video and using a supervised machine learning approach, we show that accelerometry signatures can classify the behaviour of wild animals at unprecedentedly fine scales."},{"title":"Air breathing in the Arctic: influence of temperature, hypoxia, activity and restricted air access on respiratory physiology of the Alaska blackfish Dallia pectoralis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4387","abstract":"The Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) is an air-breathing fish native to Alaska and the Bering Sea islands, where it inhabits lakes that are ice-covered in the winter, but enters warm and hypoxic waters in the summer to forage and reproduce.

Pcrit was relatively high (5 kPa) and there were no differences in Pcrit, gill morphology, haematocrit or haemoglobin oxygen affinity at the two temperatures. Therefore, Alaska blackfish depends on air breathing in hypoxia and additional mechanisms must thus be utilised to survive hypoxic submergence during the winter, such as hypoxia-induced enhancement in the capacities for carrying and binding blood oxygen, behavioural avoidance of hypoxia and suppression of metabolic rate."},{"title":"Effects of unsaturated fatty acids on torpor frequency and diet selection in Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4313","abstract":"Essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been shown to play a beneficial role in hibernating mammals. High amounts of dietary PUFA led to an earlier hibernation onset, deeper and longer hibernation bouts and a higher proportion of hibernating animals in several species. In contrast, the relevance of dietary PUFA for daily heterotherms exhibiting only brief and shallow torpor bouts is less well studied. Therefore, diets differing in PUFA composition were used to examine the effects on the frequency of spontaneous daily torpor in Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). In contrast to earlier studies, we were interested in whether the ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFA affects torpor expression, and in comparison with a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Although we found a positive effect on torpor frequency in hamsters fed a diet rich in n-6 PUFA compared with the groups fed diets either rich in n-3 PUFA or MUFA, the latter two groups did not show unusually low torpor frequencies. The results of the additional diet choice experiment indicated that hamsters in short photoperiod select food with only a slight excess of n-6 PUFA compared with n-3 PUFA (ratio of 1 to 1.5). However, there was no significant difference in torpor frequency between the diet choice group and hamsters fed on standard chow with a sevenfold excess of n-6 PUFA. In summary, the present data strongly indicate that the dietary composition of unsaturated fatty acids plays a minor role in the occurrence of spontaneous daily torpor in Djungarian hamsters."},{"title":"Prey fish escape by sensing the bow wave of a predator","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4328","abstract":"Prey fish possess a remarkable ability to sense and evade an attack from a larger fish. Despite the importance of these events to the biology of fishes, it remains unclear how sensory cues stimulate an effective evasive maneuver. Here, we show that larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) evade predators using an escape response that is stimulated by the water flow generated by an approaching predator. Measurements of the high-speed responses of larvae in the dark to a robotic predator suggest that larvae respond to the subtle flows in front of the predator using the lateral line system. This flow, known as the bow wave, was visualized and modeled with computational fluid dynamics. According to the predictions of the model, larvae direct their escape away from the side of their body exposed to more rapid flow. This suggests that prey fish use a flow reflex that enables predator evasion by generating a directed maneuver at high speed. These findings demonstrate a sensory-motor mechanism that underlies a behavior that is crucial to the ecology and evolution of fishes."},{"title":"Saving energy during hard times: energetic adaptations of Shetland pony mares","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4320","abstract":"Recent results suggest that wild Northern herbivores reduce their metabolism during times of low ambient temperature and food shortage in order to reduce their energetic needs. It is, however, not known whether domesticated animals are also able to reduce their energy expenditure. We exposed 10 Shetland pony mares to different environmental conditions (summer and winter) and to two food quantities (60% and 100% of maintenance energy requirement) during low winter temperatures to examine energetic and behavioural responses. In summer, ponies showed a considerably higher field metabolic rate (FMR; 63.4±15.0 MJ day–1) compared with food-restricted and control animals in winter (24.6±7.8 and 15.0±1.1 MJ day–1, respectively). During summer, locomotor activity, resting heart rate and total water turnover were considerably elevated (P<0.001) compared with winter. Animals on a restricted diet (N=5) compensated for the decreased energy supply by reducing their FMR by 26% compared with control animals (N=5). Furthermore, resting heart rate, body mass and body condition score were lower (29.2±2.7 beats min–1, 140±22 kg and 3.0±1.0 points, respectively) than in control animals (36.8±41 beats min–1, 165±31 kg, 4.4±0.7 points; P<0.05). While the observed behaviour did not change, nocturnal hypothermia was elevated. We conclude that ponies acclimatize to different climatic conditions by changing their metabolic rate, behaviour and some physiological parameters. When exposed to energy challenges, ponies, like wild herbivores, exhibited hypometabolism and nocturnal hypothermia."},{"title":"Different transcription regulation routes are exerted by l- and d-amino acid enantiomers of peptide hormones","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4337","abstract":"Conversion of one or more amino acids in eukaryotic peptides to the d-enantiomer configuration is catalyzed by specific l/d-peptide isomerases and it is a poorly investigated post-translational modification. No common modified amino acid or specific modified position has been recognized, and mechanisms underlying changes in the peptide function provided by this conversion are not widely studied. The 72 amino acid crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) in Astacidea crustaceans exhibits a co-existence of two peptide enantiomers with either d- or l-phenylalanine as their third residue. It is a pleiotropic hormone regulating several physiological processes in different target tissues and along different time scales. CHH enantiomers differently affect time courses and intensities of examined processes. The short-term effects of the two isomers on gene expression were examined in the hepatopancreas, gills, hemocytes and muscles of the astacid Pontastacus leptodactylus. Gene expression in muscles and hemocytes was not affected by either of the isomers. Two modes of action for CHH were elucidated in the hepatopancreas and the gills: specific gene induction in both organs by d-CHH, and targeted attenuation caused by both enantiomers in the gills. Consequently, a two-receptor system is proposed for conveying the effect of the two CHH isomers."},{"title":"Jumping mechanisms in lacewings (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae and Hemerobiidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4252","abstract":"Lacewings launch themselves into the air by simultaneous propulsive movements of the middle and hind legs as revealed in video images captured at a rate of 1000 s−1. These movements were powered largely by thoracic trochanteral depressor muscles but did not start from a particular preset position of these legs. Ridges on the lateral sides of the meso- and metathorax fluoresced bright blue when illuminated with ultraviolet light, suggesting the presence of the elastic protein resilin. The middle and hind legs were longer than the front legs but their femora and tibiae were narrow tubes of similar diameter. Jumps were of two types. First, those in which the body was oriented almost parallel to the ground (−7±8 deg in green lacewings, 13.7±7 deg in brown lacewings) at take-off and remained stable once animals were airborne. The wings did not move until 5 ms after take-off when flapping flight ensued. Second, were jumps in which the head pointed downwards at take-off (green lacewings, −37±3 deg; brown lacewings, −35±4 deg) and the body rotated in the pitch plane once airborne without the wings opening. The larger green lacewings (mass 9 mg, body length 10.3 mm) took 15 ms and the smaller brown lacewings (3.6 mg and 5.3 mm) 9 ms to accelerate the body to mean take-off velocities of 0.6 and 0.5 m s−1. During their fastest jumps green and brown lacewings experienced accelerations of 5.5 or 6.3g, respectively. They required an energy expenditure of 5.6 or 0.7 μJ, a power output of 0.3 or 0.1 mW and exerted a force of 0.6 or 0.2 mN. The required power was well within the maximum active contractile limit of normal muscle, so that jumping could be produced by direct muscle contractions without a power amplification mechanism or an energy store."},{"title":"Graded behavioral responses and habituation to sound in the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/24/4347","abstract":"Sound is a widely available and vital cue in aquatic environments, yet most bioacoustic research has focused on marine vertebrates, leaving sound detection in invertebrates poorly understood. Cephalopods are an ecologically key taxon that likely use sound and may be impacted by increasing anthropogenic ocean noise, but little is known regarding their behavioral responses or adaptations to sound stimuli. These experiments identify the acoustic range and levels that elicit a wide range of secondary defense behaviors such as inking, jetting and rapid coloration change. Secondarily, it was found that cuttlefish habituate to certain sound stimuli. The present study examined the behavioral responses of 22 cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) to pure-tone pips ranging from 80 to 1000 Hz with sound pressure levels of 85–188 dB re. 1 μPa rms and particle accelerations of 0–17.1 m s–2. Cuttlefish escape responses (inking, jetting) were observed between frequencies of 80 and 300 Hz and at sound levels above 140 dB re. 1 μPa rms and 0.01 m s–2 (0.74 m s–2 for inking responses). Body patterning changes and fin movements were observed at all frequencies and sound levels. Response intensity was dependent upon stimulus amplitude and frequency, suggesting that cuttlefish also possess loudness perception with a maximum sensitivity around 150 Hz. Cuttlefish habituated to repeated 200 Hz tone pips, at two sound intensities. Total response inhibition was not reached, however, and a basal response remained present in most animals. The graded responses provide a loudness sensitivity curve and suggest an ecological function for sound use in cephalopods."},{"title":"Cockroach optomotor responses below single photon level","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4262","abstract":"Reliable vision in dim light depends on the efficient capture of photons. Moreover, visually guided behaviour requires reliable signals from the photoreceptors to generate appropriate motor reactions. Here, we show that at behavioural low-light threshold, cockroach photoreceptors respond to moving gratings with single-photon absorption events known as ‘quantum bumps’ at or below the rate of 0.1 s−1. By performing behavioural experiments and intracellular recordings from photoreceptors under identical stimulus conditions, we demonstrate that continuous modulation of the photoreceptor membrane potential is not necessary to elicit visually guided behaviour. The results indicate that in cockroach motion detection, massive temporal and spatial pooling takes place throughout the eye under dim conditions, involving currently unknown neural processing algorithms. The extremely high night-vision capability of the cockroach visual system provides a roadmap for bio-mimetic imaging design."},{"title":"Expression of cytoskeletal and molt-related genes is temporally scheduled in the hypodermis of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii during premolt","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4193","abstract":"The rigid crustacean exoskeleton, the cuticle, is composed of the polysaccharide chitin, structural proteins and mineral deposits. It is periodically replaced to enable growth and its construction is an energy-demanding process. Ecdysis, the shedding event of the old cuticle, is preceded by a preparatory phase, termed premolt, in which the present cuticle is partially degraded and a new one is formed underneath it. Procambarus clarkii (Girard 1852), an astacid crustacean, was used here to comprehensively examine the changing patterns of gene expression in the hypodermis underlying the cuticle of the carapace at seven time points along ~14 premolt days. Next generation sequencing was used to construct a multi-tissue P. clarkii transcript sequence assembly for general use in a variety of transcriptomic studies. A reference transcriptome was created here in order to perform digital transcript expression analysis, determining the gene expression profiles in each of the examined premolt stages. The analysis revealed a cascade of sequential expression events of molt-related genes involved in chitin degradation, synthesis and modification, as well as synthesis of collagen and four groups of cuticular structural genes. The new description of major transcriptional events during premolt and the determination of their timing provide temporal markers for future studies of molt progress and regulation. The peaks of the expression of the molt-related genes were preceded by expression peaks of cytoskeletal genes that are hypothesized to be essential for premolt progress through regulating protein synthesis and/or transport, probably by remodeling the cytoskeletal structure."},{"title":"Magnetoreception in birds: II.

To test the hypothesis in behavioural experiments, we tested robins, Erithacus rubecula, under various wavelengths (1) after 1 h pre-exposure to total darkness and (2) after 1 h pre-exposure to the same light as used in the test. The birds were oriented under blue and turquoise light, where the full cryptochrome cycle can run, but not under green light. This finding is in agreement with the hypothesis. Orientation under green light appears to be a transient phenomenon until the supply of semiquinone is depleted."},{"title":"Cold acclimation increases cardiac myofilament function and ventricular pressure generation in trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4132","abstract":"Reducing temperature below the optimum of most vertebrate hearts impairs contractility and reduces organ function. However, a number of fish species, including the rainbow trout, can seasonally acclimate to low temperature. Such ability requires modification of physiological systems to compensate for the thermodynamic effects of temperature on biological processes. The current study tested the hypothesis that rainbow trout compensate for the direct effect of cold temperature by increasing cardiac contractility during cold acclimation. We examined cardiac contractility, following thermal acclimation (4, 11 and 17°C), by measuring the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation by chemically skinned cardiac trabeculae as well as ventricular pressure generation using a modified Langendorff preparation. We demonstrate, for the first time, that the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation was significantly higher in cardiac trabeculae from 4°C-acclimated trout compared with those acclimated to 11 or 17°C, and that this functional change occurred in parallel with a decrease in the level of cardiac troponin T phosphorylation. In addition, we show that the magnitude and rate of ventricular pressure generation was greater in hearts from trout acclimated to 4°C compared with those from animals acclimated to 11 or 17°C. Taken together, these results suggest that enhanced myofilament function, caused by modification of existing contractile proteins, is at least partially responsible for the observed increase in pressure generation after acclimation to 4°C. In addition, by examining the phenotypic plasticity of a comparative model we have identified a strategy, used in vivo, by which the force-generating capacity of cardiac muscle can be increased."},{"title":"Conditioned discrimination of magnetic inclination in a spatial-orientation arena task by homing pigeons (Columba livia)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4123","abstract":"It has been well established that homing pigeons are able to use the Earth's magnetic field to obtain directional information when returning to their loft and that their magnetic compass is based, at least in part, on the perception of magnetic inclination. Magnetic inclination has also been hypothesized in pigeons and other long-distance navigators, such as sea turtles, to play a role providing positional information as part of a map. Here we developed a behavioral paradigm which allows us to condition homing pigeons to discriminate magnetic inclination cues in a spatial-orientation arena task. Six homing pigeons were required to discriminate in a circular arena between feeders located either in a zone with a close to 0 deg inclination cue or in a zone with a rapidly changing inclination cue (−3 deg to +85 deg when approaching the feeder and +85deg to −3 deg when moving away from the feeder) to obtain a food reward. The pigeons consistently performed this task above chance level. Control experiments, during which the coils were turned off or the current was running anti-parallel through the double-wound coil system, confirmed that no alternative cues were used by the birds in the discrimination task. The results show that homing pigeons can be conditioned to discriminate differences in magnetic field inclination, enabling investigation into the peripheral and central neural processing of geomagnetic inclination under controlled laboratory conditions."},{"title":"Ventilation of multi-entranced rodent burrows by boundary layer eddies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4141","abstract":"Rodent burrows are often assumed to be environments wherein the air has a high concentration of CO2. Although high burrow [CO2] has been recorded, many studies report burrow [CO2] that differs only slightly from atmospheric concentrations. Here, we advocate that one of the reasons for these differences is the penetration into burrows of air gusts (eddies), which originate in the turbulent boundary layer and prevent build-up of CO2. We have characterized the means by which burrows of Sundevall's jird, which are representative of the burrows of many rodent species with more than one entrance, are ventilated. Our results demonstrate that, even at low wind speeds, the random penetration of eddies into a burrow through its openings is sufficient to keep the burrow [CO2] low enough to be physiologically inconsequential, even in its deep and remote parts."},{"title":"One rhinophore probably provides sufficient sensory input for odour-based navigation by the nudibranch mollusc Tritonia diomedea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4149","abstract":"Tritonia diomedea (synonymous with Tritonia tetraquetra) navigates in turbulent odour plumes, crawling upstream towards prey and downstream to avoid predators. This is probably accomplished by odour-gated rheotaxis, but other possibilities have not been excluded. Our goal was to test whether T. diomedea uses odour-gated rheotaxis and to simultaneously determine which of the cephalic sensory organs (rhinophores and oral veil) are required for navigation. In a first experiment, slugs showed no coherent responses to streams of odour directed at single rhinophores. In a second experiment, navigation in prey and predator odour plumes was compared between animals with unilateral rhinophore lesions, denervated oral veils, or combined unilateral rhinophore lesions and denervated oral veils. In all treatments, animals navigated in a similar manner to that of control and sham-operated animals, indicating that a single rhinophore provides sufficient sensory input for navigation (assuming that a distributed flow measurement system would also be affected by the denervations). Amongst various potential navigational strategies, only odour-gated positive rheotaxis can produce the navigation tracks we observed in prey plumes while receiving input from a single sensor. Thus, we provide strong evidence that T. diomedea uses odour-gated rheotaxis in attractive odour plumes, with odours and flow detected by the rhinophores. In predator plumes, slugs turned downstream to varying degrees rather than orienting directly downstream for crawling, resulting in greater dispersion for negative rheotaxis in aversive plumes. These conclusions are the first explicit confirmation of odour-gated rheotaxis as a navigational strategy in gastropods and are also a foundation for exploring the neural circuits that mediate odour-gated rheotaxis."},{"title":"Combining sky and earth: desert ants (Melophorus bagoti) show weighted integration of celestial and terrestrial cues","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4159","abstract":"Insects typically use celestial sources of directional information for path integration, and terrestrial panoramic information for view-based navigation. Here we set celestial and terrestrial sources of directional information in conflict for homing desert ants (Melophorus bagoti). In the first experiment, ants learned to navigate out of a round experimental arena with a distinctive artificial panorama. On crucial tests, we rotated the arena to create a conflict between the artificial panorama and celestial information. In a second experiment, ants at a feeder in their natural visually-cluttered habitat were displaced prior to their homing journey so that the dictates of path integration (feeder to nest direction) based on a celestial compass conflicted with the dictates of view-based navigation (release point to nest direction) based on the natural terrestrial panorama. In both experiments, ants generally headed in a direction intermediate to the dictates of celestial and terrestrial information. In the second experiment, the ants put more weight on the terrestrial cues when they provided better directional information. We conclude that desert ants weight and integrate the dictates of celestial and terrestrial information in determining their initial heading, even when the two directional cues are highly discrepant."},{"title":"Potential sources of intra-population variation in the overwintering strategy of painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) hatchlings","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4174","abstract":"Many temperate animals spend half their lives in a non-active, overwintering state, and multiple adaptations have evolved to enable winter survival. One notable vertebrate model is Chrysemys picta, whose hatchlings display dichotomous overwintering strategies: some hatchlings spend their first winter aquatically after nest emergence in the autumn, whereas others overwinter terrestrially within their natal nest with subsequent emergence in the spring. The occurrence of these strategies varies among populations and temporally within populations; however, factors that determine the strategy employed by a nest in nature are unknown. We examined potential factors that influence intra-population variation in the overwintering strategy of C. picta hatchlings over two winters in Algonquin Park, Ontario. We found that environmental factors may be a trigger for the hatchling overwintering strategy: autumn-emerging nests were sloped towards the water and were surrounded by a relatively higher percentage of bare ground compared with spring-emerging nests. Autumn-emerging hatchlings were also relatively smaller. Overwintering strategy was not associated with clutch oviposition sequence, or mammalian or avian predation attempts. Instead, autumn emergence from the nest was associated with the direct mortality threat of predation by sarcophagid fly larvae. Body condition and righting response, measured as proxies of hatchling fitness, did not differ between overwintering strategies. Costs and benefits of overwintering aquatically versus terrestrially in hatchling C. picta are largely unknown, and have the potential to affect population dynamics. Understanding winter survival has great implications for turtle ecology, thus we emphasize areas for future research on dichotomous overwintering strategies in temperate hatchling turtles."},{"title":"Physiological and behavioral evidence of a capsaicin-sensitive TRPV-like channel in the medicinal leech","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4167","abstract":"Transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels are found throughout the animal kingdom, where they play an important role in sensory transduction. In this study, we combined physiological studies with in vivo behavioral experiments to examine the presence of a putative TRPV-like receptor in the medicinal leech, building upon earlier studies in this lophotrochozoan invertebrate. The leech polymodal nociceptive neuron was activated by both peripheral and central application of the TRPV1-activator capsaicin in a concentration-dependent manner, with 100 μmol l−1 being the lowest effective concentration. Responses to capsaicin were inhibited by the selective TRPV1 antagonist SB366791. The polymodal nociceptive neuron also responded to noxious thermal stimuli (>40°C), and this response was also blocked by SB366791. Capsaicin sensitivity was selective to the polymodal nociceptor with no direct response being elicited in the mechanical nociceptive neuron or in the non-nociceptive touch- or pressure-sensitive neurons. Capsaicin also elicited nocifensive behavioral responses (withdrawals and locomotion) in a concentration-dependent manner, and these behavioral responses were significantly attenuated with SB366791. These results suggest the presence of a capsaicin-sensitive TRPV-like channel in the medicinal leech central nervous system and are relevant to the evolution of nociceptive signaling."},{"title":"Long-life partners or sex friends? Impact of parental pair bond on offspring personality","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4184","abstract":"Previous investigations reported that some traits of parental relationships, including pair-bond duration or mate behavioural compatibility, influence subsequent offspring fitness by acting on their behaviour and growth and thus their early survival. We hypothesized that the development of a pair bond between sexual partners would have a prenatal influence. This study investigated the impact of two pairing managements on the egg characteristics and development of offspring of Japanese quail (Coturnix c. japonica). Thirty males and 30 females were paired either continuously (C; mates together all the time) or non-continuously (NC; pairs met only three times a week for 5 min). Separation–reunion tests evaluated parental pair bond. Egg yolk testosterone and androstenedione levels were evaluated, and the somatic and behavioural development of C and NC chicks was assessed. Our results revealed that members of C pairs were attached to their mates and, although no significant differences in androgen levels could be evidenced between egg sets, a higher proportion of C pairs' eggs were fertilized and their chicks appeared less emotive and more social. Our results revealed that the parental relationship can modulate the behavioural development of their offspring, probably via non-genetic effects, and this could play a major role in the emergence of inter-individual variability."},{"title":"Olfactory sensitivity to steroid glucuronates in Mozambique tilapia suggests two distinct and specific receptors for pheromone detection","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4203","abstract":"Cichlids offer an exciting opportunity to understand vertebrate speciation; chemical communication could be one of the drivers of African cichlid radiation. Chemical signals mediate key aspects in the lives of vertebrates and often are species specific. Dominant male Mozambique tilapia [Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters 1852)] release a sex pheromone, 5β-pregnan-3α,17α,20β-triol 3-glucuronate and its 20α-epimer, via their urine. The objective of this study was to assess the sensitivity, specificity and versatility of the olfactory system of O. mossambicus to other steroids and their conjugates using the electro-olfactogram. Oreochromis mossambicus was sensitive to several 3-glucuronidated steroids, but did not respond to prostaglandins, unconjugated steroids or 17- or 20-conjugated steroids. Stimulation of the olfactory epithelium with increasing concentrations (1 pmol l−1 to 10 μmol l−1) of 5β-pregnan-3α,17α,20β-triol 3-glucuronate, 5β-pregnan-3α,17α,20α-triol 3-glucuronate, 3α,17α-dihydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one 3-glucuronate, etiocholanolone 3α-glucuronate and 17β-estradiol 3-glucuronate produced characteristic sigmoidal concentration–response curves. However, tilapia were most sensitive to 17β-estradiol-3-glucuronate, which also had the lowest apparent EC50 and maximal response amplitude. Cross-adaptation and binary mixture experiments suggested that 5β,3α-reduced pregnan- and androstan-3-glucuronates share (a) common olfactory receptor(s), whereas 17β-estradiol 3-glucuronate is detected via (a) distinct olfactory receptor(s). In conclusion, the Mozambique tilapia has evolved high olfactory sensitivity and specificity to 3-glucuronidated steroids through two distinct olfactory receptor types; one detecting a male sex pheromone and a second detecting 17β-estradiol 3-glucuronate, a putative female-derived signal. However, O. mossambicus differs markedly in its olfactory perception from the more recently derived East African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, suggesting that chemical communication could, indeed, be involved in speciation."},{"title":"Attachment of Galerucella nymphaeae (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae) to surfaces with different surface energy","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4213","abstract":"Numerous studies deal with insect attachment onto surfaces with different roughness; however, little is known about insect attachment onto surfaces that have different chemistry. In the present study, we describe the attachment structures of the water-lily leaf beetle Galerucella nymphaeae and test the hypothesis that the larval and adult stages generate the strongest attachment on surfaces with contact angles that are similar to those of leaves of their host plants. The larvae bear a smooth attachment system with arolium-like structures at their legs and a pygopodium at the abdomen tip. Adults have pointed setae on the ventral side of the two proximal tarsomeres and densely arranged spatula-shaped ones on their third tarsomere. In a centrifugal force tester, larvae and adults attained the highest friction forces and safety factors on surfaces with a water contact angle of 83 deg compared to those of 6, 26 and 109 deg. This comes close to the contact angle of their host plant Nuphar lutea (86 deg). The similarity in larval and adult performances might be a result of the similar chemical composition of their attachment fluid. We compare our findings with previous studies on the forces that insects generate on surfaces with different surface energies."},{"title":"Magnetoreception in birds: I. Immunohistochemical studies concerning the cryptochrome cycle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4221","abstract":"Cryptochrome 1a, located in the UV/violet-sensitive cones in the avian retina, is discussed as receptor molecule for the magnetic compass of birds. Our previous immunohistochemical studies of chicken retinae with an antiserum that labelled only activated cryptochrome 1a had shown activation of cryptochrome 1a under 373 nm UV, 424 nm blue, 502 nm turquoise and 565 nm green light. Green light, however, does not allow the first step of photoreduction of oxidized cryptochromes to the semiquinone. As the chickens had been kept under ‘white’ light before, we suggested that there was a supply of the semiquinone present at the beginning of the exposure to green light, which could be further reduced and then re-oxidized. To test this hypothesis, we exposed chickens to various wavelengths (1) for 30 min after being kept in daylight, (2) for 30 min after a 30 min pre-exposure to total darkness, and (3) for 1 h after being kept in daylight. In the first case, we found activated cryptochrome 1a under UV, blue, turquoise and green light; in the second two cases we found activated cryptochrome 1a only under UV to turquoise light, where the complete redox cycle of cryptochrome can run, but not under green light. This observation is in agreement with the hypothesis that activated cryptochrome 1a is found as long as there is some of the semiquinone left, but not when the supply is depleted. It supports the idea that the crucial radical pair for magnetoreception is generated during re-oxidation."},{"title":"Does reproduction protect against oxidative stress?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4237","abstract":"A central principle of life-history theory is that parents trade investment in reproduction against that in body maintenance. One physiological cost thought to be important as a modulator of such trade-off is oxidative stress. Experimental support for this hypothesis has, however, proved to be contradictory. In this study, we manipulated the nestling rearing effort of captive canaries (Serinus canaria) soon after the hatching of their nestlings using a brood-size manipulation to test whether an increase in nestling rearing effort translates into an increase in oxidative damage, an increase in ceruloplasmin (which is upregulated in response to oxidative damage) and a decrease in thiol antioxidants. We also compared the blood oxidative stress level of reproducing birds with that of non-reproducing birds, a crucial aspect that most studies have invariably failed to include in tests of the oxidative cost of reproduction. Compared with non-breeding canaries and pre-manipulation values, plasma oxidative damage (reactive oxygen metabolites and protein carbonyls) decreased in breeding canaries irrespective of sex and brood size. In contrast, oxidative damage did not change in non-breeding birds over the experiment. Ceruloplasmin activity in plasma and both non-protein and protein thiols in red blood cells did not change throughout the experiment in both treatment groups. Our results suggest that reproduction may result in decreased rather than increased blood oxidative stress. Our results may explain some of the inconsistencies that have so far been reported in experimental tests of the oxidative cost of reproduction hypothesis."},{"title":"Bottlenose dolphins modify behavior to reduce metabolic effect of tag attachment","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4229","abstract":"Attaching bio-telemetry or -logging devices (‘tags’) to marine animals for research and monitoring adds drag to streamlined bodies, thus affecting posture, swimming gaits and energy balance.

A combined theoretical and computational fluid dynamics model estimating drag forces and power exertion during swimming suggests that drag loading and energy consumption are reduced at lower swimming speeds. Bottlenose dolphins in the specific swimming task in this experiment slowed to the point where the tag yielded no increases in drag or power, while showing no difference in metabolic parameters when instrumented with a DTAG2. These results, and our observations, suggest that animals modify their behavior to maintain metabolic output and energy expenditure when faced with tag-induced drag."},{"title":"Do greater mouse-eared bats experience a trade-off between energy conservation and learning?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/4043","abstract":"Bats, some species of rodents and some birds are able to save energy during the summer period by decreasing their body temperature and falling into torpor. Some studies indicate that torpor prevents sleeping and causes effects similar to sleep deprivation. Impairment of processes stabilizing memory slows down learning accuracy and speed. We conducted two experiments to test whether greater mouse-eared bats, Myotis myotis, which commonly use torpor during the summer period, experience a trade-off between energy savings and learning abilities. We compared learning speed and accuracy in bats that were exposed to low (7°C) and higher ambient temperatures (22°C) between training and experimental sessions. Tests were conducted in experiments with food reward (food search) and without food reward (perch search). Time spent with the skin temperature above 30°C was significantly longer for bats exposed to 22°C than for those exposed to 7°C, and longer in experiments with food reward than without food reward. We observed only a very weak tendency for better accuracy and shorter search times in bats exposed to 22°C than in those exposed to 7°C. Our data indicate that memory consolidation of bats under natural conditions is not affected by daily torpor when bats are in good condition and may therefore defend against a rapid fall into torpor. We suggest that homeostatic processes connected with the circadian rhythm allow protection of the consolidation of memory for relatively simple tasks despite time spent in torpor."},{"title":"Developmental variation in sound production in water and air in the blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/23/4244","abstract":"Blue catfish, Ictalurus furcatus, the largest catfish in North America, produce pectoral stridulation sounds (distress calls) when attacked and held. They have both fish and bird predators, and the frequency spectrum of their sounds is better matched to the hearing of birds than to that of unspecialized fish predators with low frequency hearing. It is unclear whether their sounds evolved to function in air or water. We categorized the calls and how they change with fish size in air and water and compared developmental changes in call parameters with stridulation motions captured with a high-speed camera. Stridulation sounds consist of a variable series of pulses produced during abduction of the pectoral spine. Pulses are caused by quick rapid spine rotations (jerks) of the pectoral spine that do not change with fish size although larger individuals generate longer, higher amplitude pulses with lower peak frequencies. There are longer pauses between jerks, and therefore fewer jerks and fewer pulses, in larger fish, which take longer to abduct their spines and therefore produce a longer series of pulses per abduction sweep. Sounds couple more effectively to water (1400 times greater pressure in Pascals at 1 m), are more sharply tuned and have lower peak frequencies than in air. Blue catfish stridulation sounds appear to be specialized to produce underwater signals although most of the sound spectrum includes frequencies matched to catfish hearing but largely above the hearing range of unspecialized fishes."},{"title":"Teaching an old jaw new tricks: diet-induced plasticity in a model organism from weaning to adulthood","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/4099","abstract":"Many organisms exhibit a decrease in the ability to modify their phenotypes in response to shifts in environmental conditions as they mature. Such age-dependent plasticity has important implications in a variety of evolutionary and ecological contexts, particularly with respect to understanding adaptive responses to heterogeneous environments. In this study, we used experimental diet manipulation to examine the life-history trajectory of plasticity in the feeding complex of a model organism, the white rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). We demonstrate that, contrary to expectations derived from previous cross-sectional studies of skeletal plasticity, the jaws of weanlings and young adults exhibit similar increases in relative bone cross-sectional areas in response to the introduction of mechanically challenging foods into their diets. Furthermore, we present evidence that sensitivity to loading patterns persists well into adulthood in some regions of the masticatory apparatus in rabbits, indicating that there is an extended window of opportunity to respond to changes in dietary properties during an animal's life span. We conclude that certain aspects of the facial skeleton of rabbits, and perhaps mammals in general, are sensitive to environmental stimuli long after skeletal maturity is achieved, highlighting the importance of plasticity as a source of adaptive variation at later life-history stages."},{"title":"Encoding wide-field motion and direction in the central complex of the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/4079","abstract":"In the arthropod brain, the central complex (CX) receives various forms of sensory signals and is associated with motor functions, but its precise role in behavior is controversial. The optomotor response is a highly conserved turning behavior directed by visual motion. In tethered cockroaches, 20% procaine injected into the CX reversibly blocked this behavior. We then used multichannel extracellular recording to sample unit activity in the CX in response to wide-field visual motion stimuli, moving either horizontally or vertically at various temporal frequencies. For the 401 units we sampled, we identified five stereotyped response patterns: tonically inhibited or excited responses during motion, phasically inhibited or excited responses at the initiation of motion, and phasically excited responses at the termination of motion. Sixty-seven percent of the units responded to horizontal motion, while only 19% responded to vertical motion. Thirty-eight percent of responding units were directionally selective to horizontal motion. Response type and directional selectivity were sometimes conditional with other stimulus parameters, such as temporal frequency. For instance, 16% of the units that responded tonically to low temporal frequencies responded phasically to high temporal frequencies. In addition, we found that 26% of wide-field motion responding units showed a periodic response that was entrained to the temporal frequency of the stimulus. Our results show a diverse population of neurons within the CX that are variably tuned to wide-field motion parameters. Our behavioral data further suggest that such CX activity is required for effective optomotor responses."},{"title":"Gravity anomalies without geomagnetic disturbances interfere with pigeon homing – a GPS tracking study","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/4057","abstract":"The gravity vector theory postulates that birds determine their position to set a home course by comparing the memorized gravity vector at the home loft with the local gravity vector at the release site, and that they should adjust their flight course to the gravity anomalies encountered. As gravity anomalies are often intermingled with geomagnetic anomalies, we released experienced pigeons from the center of a strong circular gravity anomaly (25 km diameter) not associated with magnetic anomalies and from a geophysical control site, equidistant from the home loft (91 km). After crossing the border zone of the anomaly – expected to be most critical for pigeon navigation – they dispersed significantly more than control birds, except for those having met a gravity anomaly en route.

Bursicon activity is mediated through its cognate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), rickets. We have developed a membrane-tethered bursicon construct that enables spatial modulation of rickets-mediated physiology in transgenic flies. Ubiquitous expression of tethered bursicon throughout development results in arrest at the pupal stage. The few organisms that eclose fail to undergo wing expansion. These phenotypes suggest that expression of tethered bursicon inhibits rickets-mediated function. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show in vitro that sustained stimulation of rickets by tethered bursicon leads to receptor desensitization. Furthermore, tissue-specific expression of the tethered bursicon inhibitor unraveled a critical role for rickets in a subset of adult muscles. Taken together, our findings highlight the utility of membrane-tethered inhibitors as important genetic/pharmacological tools to dissect the tissue-specific roles of GPCRs in vivo."},{"title":"Distress sounds of thorny catfishes emitted underwater and in air: characteristics and potential significance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/4068","abstract":"Thorny catfishes produce stridulation (SR) sounds using their pectoral fins and drumming (DR) sounds via a swimbladder mechanism in distress situations when hand held in water and in air. It has been argued that SR and DR sounds are aimed at different receivers (predators) in different media. The aim of this study was to analyse and compare sounds emitted in both air and water in order to test different hypotheses on the functional significance of distress sounds. Five representatives of the family Doradidae were investigated. Fish were hand held and sounds emitted in air and underwater were recorded (number of sounds, sound duration, dominant and fundamental frequency, sound pressure level and peak-to-peak amplitudes). All species produced SR sounds in both media, but DR sounds could not be recorded in air for two species. Differences in sound characteristics between media were small and mainly limited to spectral differences in SR. The number of sounds emitted decreased over time, whereas the duration of SR sounds increased. The dominant frequency of SR and the fundamental frequency of DR decreased and sound pressure level of SR increased with body size across species. The hypothesis that catfish produce more SR sounds in air and more DR sounds in water as a result of different predation pressure (birds versus fish) could not be confirmed. It is assumed that SR sounds serve as distress sounds in both media, whereas DR sounds might primarily be used as intraspecific communication signals in water in species possessing both mechanisms."},{"title":"Planar covariation of limb elevation angles during bipedal locomotion in common quails (Coturnix coturnix)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/3968","abstract":"In human bipedal walking, temporal changes in the elevation angle of the thigh, shank and foot segments covary to form a regular loop within a single plane in three-dimensional space. In this study, we quantified the planar covariation of limb elevation angles during bipedal locomotion in common quails to test whether the degree of planarity and the orientation of the covariance plane differ between birds, humans and Japanese macaques as reported in published accounts. Five quails locomoted on a treadmill and were recorded by a lateral X-ray fluoroscopy. The elevation angle of the thigh, shank and foot segments relative to the vertical axis was calculated and compared with published data on human and macaque bipedal locomotion. The results showed that the planar covariation applied to quail bipedal locomotion and planarity was stronger in quails than in humans. The orientation of the covariation plane in quails differed from that in humans, and was more similar to the orientation of the covariation plane in macaques. Although human walking is characterized by vaulting mechanics of the body center of mass, quails and macaques utilize spring-like running mechanics even though the duty factor is >0.5. Therefore, differences in the stance leg mechanics between quails and humans may underlie the difference in the orientation of the covariation plane. The planar covariation of inter-segmental coordination has evolved independently in both avian and human locomotion, despite the different mechanical constraints."},{"title":"Temperature and acidification variability reduce physiological performance in the intertidal zone porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/3974","abstract":"We show here that increased variability of temperature and pH synergistically negatively affects the energetics of intertidal zone crabs. Under future climate scenarios, coastal ecosystems are projected to have increased extremes of low tide-associated thermal stress and ocean acidification-associated low pH, the individual or interactive effects of which have yet to be determined. To characterize energetic consequences of exposure to increased variability of pH and temperature, we exposed porcelain crabs, Petrolisthes cinctipes, to conditions that simulated current and future intertidal zone thermal and pH environments. During the daily low tide, specimens were exposed to no, moderate or extreme heating, and during the daily high tide experienced no, moderate or extreme acidification. Respiration rate and cardiac thermal limits were assessed following 2.5 weeks of acclimation. Thermal variation had a larger overall effect than pH variation, though there was an interactive effect between the two environmental drivers. Under the most extreme temperature and pH combination, respiration rate decreased while heat tolerance increased, indicating a smaller overall aerobic energy budget (i.e. a reduced O2 consumption rate) of which a larger portion is devoted to basal maintenance (i.e. greater thermal tolerance indicating induction of the cellular stress response). These results suggest the potential for negative long-term ecological consequences for intertidal ectotherms exposed to increased extremes in pH and temperature due to reduced energy for behavior and reproduction."},{"title":"Larval size and age affect colonization in a marine invertebrate","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/3981","abstract":"The relationship between offspring size and performance determines the optimal trade-off between producing many small offspring or fewer large offspring and the existence of this relationship has become a central tenet of life-history theory. For organisms with multiple life-history stages, the relationship between offspring size and performance is determined by the effects of offspring size in each life-history stage. Marine invertebrates have long been a model system for examining the evolutionary ecology of offspring size, and whilst offspring size effects have been found in several life-history stages, the crucial stage of colonization has received less attention. We examined the effect of offspring size on the settlement response of sea-urchin larvae (Heliocidaris erythrogramma) to preferred and less preferred host plants, how these effects changed over the larval period and estimated the success of juveniles in the field on preferred and less-preferred host plants. We found that smaller larvae became competent to respond to preferred host plant cues sooner than larger larvae but larger larvae rejected less-preferred host plants for longer than smaller larvae. Overall, smaller H. erythrogramma larvae are likely to have less dispersal potential and are more likely to settle in less-preferred habitats whereas larger larvae appear to have an obligately longer dispersal period but settle in preferred habitats. Our results suggest that marine invertebrates that produce non-feeding larvae may have the potential to affect the dispersal of their offspring in previously unanticipated ways and that offspring size is subject to a complex web of selection across life-history stages."},{"title":"Mechanisms of naturally evolved ethanol resistance in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/3996","abstract":"The decaying fruit in which Drosophila melanogaster feed and breed can contain ethanol in concentrations as high as 6–7%. In this cosmopolitan species, populations from temperate regions are consistently more resistant to ethanol poisoning than populations from the tropics, but little is known about the physiological basis of this difference. I show that when exposed to low levels of ethanol vapor, flies from a tropical African population accumulated 2–3 times more internal ethanol than flies from a European population, giving evidence that faster ethanol catabolism by European flies contributes to the resistance difference. Using lines differing only in the origin of their third chromosome, however, I show that faster ethanol elimination cannot fully explain the resistance difference, because relative to African third chromosomes, European third chromosomes confer substantially higher ethanol resistance, while having little effect on internal ethanol concentrations. European third chromosomes also confer higher resistance to acetic acid, a metabolic product of ethanol, than African third chromosomes, suggesting that the higher ethanol resistance conferred by the former might be due to increased resistance to deleterious effects of ethanol-derived acetic acid. In support of this hypothesis, when ethanol catabolism was blocked with an Alcohol dehydrogenase mutant, there was no difference in ethanol resistance between flies with European and African third chromosomes."},{"title":"The amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus uses different strategies to maintain oxygen delivery during aquatic hypoxia and air exposure","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/3988","abstract":"Despite the abundance of oxygen in atmospheric air relative to water, the initial loss of respiratory surface area and accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood of amphibious fishes during emersion may result in hypoxemia. Given that the ability to respond to low oxygen conditions predates the vertebrate invasion of land, we hypothesized that amphibious fishes maintain O2 uptake and transport while emersed by mounting a co-opted hypoxia response. We acclimated the amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus, which are able to remain active for weeks in both air and water, for 7 days to normoxic brackish water (15‰, ~21kPa O2; control), aquatic hypoxia (~3.6kPa), normoxic air (~21 kPa) or aerial hypoxia (~13.6kPa). Angiogenesis in the skin and bucco-opercular chamber was pronounced in air- versus water-acclimated fish, but not in response to hypoxia. Aquatic hypoxia increased the O2-carrying capacity of blood via a large (40%) increase in red blood cell density and a small increase in the affinity of hemoglobin for O2 (P50 decreased 11%). In contrast, air exposure increased the hemoglobin O2 affinity (decreased P50) by 25% without affecting the number of red blood cells. Acclimation to aerial hypoxia both increased the O2-carrying capacity and decreased the hemoglobin O2 affinity. These results suggest that O2 transport is regulated both by O2 availability and also, independently, by air exposure. The ability of the hematological system to respond to air exposure independent of O2 availability may allow extant amphibious fishes, and may also have allowed primitive tetrapods to cope with the complex challenges of aerial respiration during the invasion of land."},{"title":"The flavonol epicatechin reverses the suppressive effects of a stressor on long-term memory formation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/4004","abstract":"Learning and subsequent memory formation are influenced by both environmental and lifestyle factors, such as stress and diet. Epicatechin, a plant flavonol found in cocoa, red wine and green tea enhances long-term memory (LTM) formation in Lymnaea. By contrast, an ecologically relevant stressor, low-calcium pond water, suppresses LTM formation. We tested the hypothesis that epicatechin overcomes the suppressive effects of the stressor on LTM formation in the continued presence of the stressor. Snails trained in low-calcium pond water exhibit learning but not LTM. Epicatechin (15 mg l−1) in control pond water enhances LTM formation. When epicatechin was added to the low-calcium pond water an enhanced LTM similar to that seen in control pond water was observed. Thus, a naturally occurring bioactive plant compound was able to overcome the suppressive effects of an ecologically relevant stressor on LTM formation."},{"title":"Human Achilles tendon plasticity in response to cyclic strain: effect of rate and duration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/4010","abstract":"High strain magnitude and low strain frequency are important stimuli for tendon adaptation. Increasing the rate and duration of the applied strain may enhance the adaptive responses. Therefore, our purpose was to investigate the effect of strain rate and duration on Achilles tendon adaptation. The study included two experimental groups (N=14 and N=12) and a control group (N=13). The participants of the experimental groups exercised according to a reference protocol (14 weeks, four times a week), featuring a high strain magnitude (~6.5%) and a low strain frequency (0.17 Hz, 3 s loading/3 s relaxation) on one leg and with either a higher strain rate (one-legged jumps) or a longer strain duration (12 s loading) on the other leg. The strain magnitude and loading volume were similar in all protocols. Before and after the interventions, the tendon stiffness, Young's modulus and cross-sectional area were examined using magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound and dynamometry. The reference and long strain duration protocols induced significantly increased (P<0.05) tendon stiffness (57% and 25%), cross-sectional area (4.2% and 5.3%) and Young's modulus (51% and 17%). The increases in tendon stiffness and Young's modulus were higher in the reference protocol. Although region-specific tendon hypertrophy was also detected after the high strain rate training, there was only a tendency of increased stiffness (P=0.08) and cross-sectional area (P=0.09). The control group did not show any changes (P=0.86). The results provide evidence that a high strain magnitude, an appropriate strain duration and repetitive loading are essential components for an efficient adaptive stimulus for tendons."},{"title":"Musculoskeletal modelling deconstructs the paradoxical effects of elastic ankle exoskeletons on plantar-flexor mechanics and energetics during hopping","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/4018","abstract":"Experiments have shown that elastic ankle exoskeletons can be used to reduce ankle joint and plantar-flexor muscle loading when hopping in place and, in turn, reduce metabolic energy consumption. However, recent experimental work has shown that such exoskeletons cause less favourable soleus (SO) muscle–tendon mechanics than is observed during normal hopping, which might limit the capacity of the exoskeleton to reduce energy consumption. To directly link plantar-flexor mechanics and energy consumption when hopping in exoskeletons, we used a musculoskeletal model of the human leg and a model of muscle energetics in simulations of muscle–tendon dynamics during hopping with and without elastic ankle exoskeletons. Simulations were driven by experimental electromyograms, joint kinematics and exoskeleton torque taken from previously published data. The data were from seven males who hopped at 2.5 Hz with and without elastic ankle exoskeletons. The energetics model showed that the total rate of metabolic energy consumption by ankle muscles was not significantly reduced by an ankle exoskeleton. This was despite large reductions in plantar-flexor force production (40–50%). The lack of larger metabolic reductions with exoskeletons was attributed to increases in plantar-flexor muscle fibre velocities and a shift to less favourable muscle fibre lengths during active force production. This limited the capacity for plantar-flexors to reduce activation and energy consumption when hopping with exoskeleton assistance."},{"title":"An integrated transcriptomic and comparative genomic analysis of differential gene expression in Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) following seawater exposure","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/4029","abstract":"High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to compare expression profiles in two Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) families post-seawater exposure to identify genes and biological processes involved in hypo-osmoregulation and regulation of salinity tolerance. To further understand the genetic architecture of hypo-osmoregulation, the genomic organization of differentially expressed (DE) genes was also analysed. Using a de novo gill transcriptome assembly we found over 2300 contigs to be DE. Major transporters from the seawater mitochondrion-rich cell (MRC) complex were up-regulated in seawater. Expression ratios for 257 differentially expressed contigs were highly correlated between families, suggesting they are strictly regulated. Based on expression profiles and known molecular pathways we inferred that seawater exposure induced changes in methylation states and elevated peroxynitrite formation in gill. We hypothesized that concomitance between DE immune genes and the transition to a hypo-osmoregulatory state could be related to Cl− sequestration by antimicrobial defence mechanisms. Gene ontology analysis revealed that cell division genes were up-regulated, which could reflect the proliferation of ATP1α1b-type seawater MRCs. Comparative genomics analyses suggest that hypo-osmoregulation is influenced by the relative proximities among a contingent of genes on Arctic charr linkage groups AC-4 and AC-12 that exhibit homologous affinities with a region on stickleback chromosome Ga-I. This supports the hypothesis that relative gene location along a chromosome is a property of the genetic architecture of hypo-osmoregulation. Evidence of non-random structure between hypo-osmoregulation candidate genes was found on AC-1/11 and AC-28, suggesting that interchromosomal rearrangements played a role in the evolution of hypo-osmoregulation in Arctic charr."},{"title":"Influence of reproductive mode on metabolic costs of reproduction: insight from the bimodal lizard Zootoca vivipara","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/22/4049","abstract":"Examination of the selective forces behind the transition from oviparity to viviparity in vertebrates must include an understanding of the relative energy costs of the two reproductive modes. However, interspecific comparisons of reproductive mode are confounded by numerous other inherent differences among the species. Therefore, we compared oxygen consumption, as a reflection of energy costs, during reproduction in oviparous and viviparous females of the reproductively bimodal lizard Zootoca vivipara (Jaquin 1787). Female oxygen consumption progressively increased over the course of reproduction, peaking just prior to parition when it was 46% (oviparous form) and 82% (viviparous form) higher than it was at the pre-reproductive stage. Total increase in oxygen consumption (TIOC) during the pre-ovulation period was not different between the reproductive modes. Conversely, post-ovulation TIOC was more than three times higher in viviparous females, reflecting a dramatic increase in embryonic metabolism as well as maternal metabolic costs of pregnancy (MCP). MCP accounted for 22% of total metabolism in viviparous females, whereas it was negligible in oviparous females. Our results demonstrate that egg retention through the first third of development, as is typical of most oviparous squamates, entails minimal maternal energy demand, while extending retention imposes much greater metabolic constraints. Selection for transition from oviparity to viviparity must therefore provide benefits that outweigh not only the added burden associated with prolonged embryonic retention, but also the substantial additional energy costs that are incurred."},{"title":"Extracellular glucose can fuel metabolism in red blood cells from high glycemic Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) but not low glycemic short-horned sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3797","abstract":"Energy metabolism was assessed in red blood cells (RBCs) from Atlantic cod and short-horned sculpin, two species that have markedly different levels of blood glucose. The objective was to determine whether the level of extracellular glucose has an impact on rates of glucose metabolism. The blood glucose level was 2.5 mmol l−1 in Atlantic cod and 0.2 mmol l−1 in short-horned sculpin, respectively. Oxygen consumption, lactate production and glucose utilization were measured in whole blood and related to grams of RBCs. Glucose utilization was assessed by measuring both glucose disappearance and the production of 3H2O from [2-3H]-glucose. RBCs from both species have an aerobic-based metabolism. In Atlantic cod, extracellular glucose is sufficient to provide the sum of glucosyl equivalents to support both oxidative metabolism and lactate production. In contrast, extracellular glucose can account for only 10% of the metabolic rate in short-horned sculpin RBCs. In both species, about 70% of glucose enters the RBCs via facilitated transport. The difference in rates of extracellular glucose utilization is related to the extremely low levels of blood glucose in short-horned sculpin. In this species energy metabolism by RBCs must be supported by alternative fuels."},{"title":"Forces and mechanical energy fluctuations during diagonal stride roller skiing; running on wheels?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3779","abstract":"Mechanical energy can be conserved during terrestrial locomotion in two ways: the inverted pendulum mechanism for walking and the spring–mass mechanism for running. Here, we investigated whether diagonal stride cross-country roller skiing (DIA) utilizes similar mechanisms. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that running and DIA would share similar phase relationships and magnitudes of kinetic energy (KE), and gravitational potential energy (GPE) fluctuations, indicating elastic energy storage and return, as if roller skiing is like ‘running on wheels’. Experienced skiers (N=9) walked and ran at 1.25 and 3 m s−1, respectively, and roller skied with DIA at both speeds on a level dual-belt treadmill that recorded perpendicular and parallel forces. We calculated the KE and GPE of the center of mass from the force recordings. As expected, the KE and GPE fluctuated with an out-of-phase pattern during walking and an in-phase pattern during running. Unlike walking, during DIA, the KE and GPE fluctuations were in phase, as they are in running. However, during the glide phase, KE was dissipated as frictional heat and could not be stored elastically in the tendons, as in running. Elastic energy storage and return epitomize running and thus we reject our hypothesis. Diagonal stride cross-country skiing is a biomechanically unique movement that only superficially resembles walking or running."},{"title":"Hyperactivation of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in Caenorhabditis elegans striated muscle can result from point mutations in the IS6 or the IIIS4 segment of the α1 subunit","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3805","abstract":"Several human diseases, including hypokalemic periodic paralysis and Timothy syndrome, are caused by mutations in voltage-gated calcium channels. The effects of these mutations are not always well understood, partially because of difficulties in expressing these channels in heterologous systems. The use of Caenorhabditis elegans could be an alternative approach to determine the effects of mutations on voltage-gated calcium channel function because all the main types of voltage-gated calcium channels are found in C. elegans, a large panel of mutations already exists and efficient genetic tools are available to engineer customized mutations in any gene. In this study, we characterize the effects of two gain-of-function mutations in egl-19, which encodes the L-type calcium channel α1 subunit. One of these mutations, ad695, leads to the replacement of a hydrophobic residue in the IIIS4 segment. The other mutation, n2368, changes a conserved glycine of IS6 segment; this mutation has been identified in patients with Timothy syndrome. We show that both egl-19 (gain-of-function) mutants have defects in locomotion and morphology that are linked to higher muscle tone. Using in situ electrophysiological approaches in striated muscle cells, we provide evidence that this high muscle tone is due to a shift of the voltage dependency towards negative potentials, associated with a decrease of the inactivation rate of the L-type Ca2+ current. Moreover, we show that the maximal conductance of the Ca2+ current is decreased in the strongest mutant egl-19(n2368), and that this decrease is correlated with a mislocalization of the channel."},{"title":"Allatostatin A-like immunoreactivity in the nervous system and gut of the larval midge Chironomus riparius: modulation of hindgut motility, rectal K+ transport and implications for exposure to salinity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3815","abstract":"Evidence for the presence of allatostatin (AST) A-like neuropeptides in the larval midge Chironomus riparius is reported. Immunohistochemical studies on the nervous system and gut revealed the presence of AST A-like immunoreactive (AST-IR) cells and processes. The nerve cord contained AST-IR processes that originated from cells in the brain and travelled the length of nerve cord to the terminal ganglion. Within each ganglion, these processes gave rise to varicosities, suggesting that they formed synapses with neurons in the ganglia. Endocrine cells containing AST-IR were present in three regions of the midgut: near the attachment of the Malpighian tubules, between the anterior and posterior midgut, and in the vicinity of the gastric caecae. The terminal ganglion also contained four AST-IR cells that gave rise to axons that projected onto the hindgut and posterior midgut. Application of a cockroach AST to the semi-isolated hindgut of larval C. riparius led to dose-dependent inhibition of muscle contractions with an EC50 of ~10 nmol l−1 and a decrease in rectal K+ reabsorption resulting from reduced rectal Na+/K+-ATPase and vacuolar type H+-ATPase activities. The results suggest the presence of endogenous AST-like neuropeptides in larval C. riparius, where these factors play a role in the function of the gut. Furthermore, regulation of ion reabsorption by ASTs at the rectum could serve as an ideal mechanism of ion regulation in the face of abrupt and acute elevated salt levels."},{"title":"Don't break a leg: running birds from quail to ostrich prioritise leg safety and economy on uneven terrain","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3786","abstract":"Cursorial ground birds are paragons of bipedal running that span a 500-fold mass range from quail to ostrich. Here we investigate the task-level control priorities of cursorial birds by analysing how they negotiate single-step obstacles that create a conflict between body stability (attenuating deviations in body motion) and consistent leg force–length dynamics (for economy and leg safety). We also test the hypothesis that control priorities shift between body stability and leg safety with increasing body size, reflecting use of active control to overcome size-related challenges. Weight-support demands lead to a shift towards straighter legs and stiffer steady gait with increasing body size, but it remains unknown whether non-steady locomotor priorities diverge with size. We found that all measured species used a consistent obstacle negotiation strategy, involving unsteady body dynamics to minimise fluctuations in leg posture and loading across multiple steps, not directly prioritising body stability. Peak leg forces remained remarkably consistent across obstacle terrain, within 0.35 body weights of level running for obstacle heights from 0.1 to 0.5 times leg length. All species used similar stance leg actuation patterns, involving asymmetric force–length trajectories and posture-dependent actuation to add or remove energy depending on landing conditions. We present a simple stance leg model that explains key features of avian bipedal locomotion, and suggests economy as a key priority on both level and uneven terrain. We suggest that running ground birds target the closely coupled priorities of economy and leg safety as the direct imperatives of control, with adequate stability achieved through appropriately tuned intrinsic dynamics."},{"title":"Chevron formation of the zebrafish muscle segments","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3870","abstract":"The muscle segments of fish have a folded shape, termed a chevron, which is thought to be optimal for the undulating body movements of swimming. However, the mechanism shaping the chevron during embryogenesis is not understood. Here, we used time-lapse microscopy of developing zebrafish embryos spanning the entire somitogenesis period to quantify the dynamics of chevron shape development. By comparing such time courses with the start of movements in wildtype zebrafish and analysing immobile mutants, we show that the previously implicated body movements do not play a role in chevron formation. Further, the monotonic increase of chevron angle along the anteroposterior axis revealed by our data constrains or rules out possible contributions by previously proposed mechanisms. In particular, we found that muscle pioneers are not required for chevron formation. We put forward a tension-and-resistance mechanism involving interactions between intra-segmental tension and segment boundaries. To evaluate this mechanism, we derived and analysed a mechanical model of a chain of contractile and resisting elements. The predictions of this model were verified by comparison with experimental data. Altogether, our results support the notion that a simple physical mechanism suffices to self-organize the observed spatiotemporal pattern in chevron formation."},{"title":"New insights into the role of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus in the sound-producing mechanism of Haemulon flavolineatum (Haemulidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3862","abstract":"Grunts are fish that are well known to vocalize, but how they produce their grunting sounds has not been clearly identified. In addition to characterizing acoustic signals and hearing in the French grunt Haemulon flavolineatum, the present study investigates the sound-production mechanism of this species by means of high-speed X-ray videos and scanning electron microscopy of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus. Vocalizations consist of a series of stridulatory sounds: grunts lasting ~47 ms with a mean period of 155 ms and a dominant frequency of ~700 Hz. Auditory capacity was determined to range from 100 to 600 Hz, with greatest sensitivity at 300 Hz (105.0±11.8 dB re. 1 μPa). This suggests that hearing is not tuned exclusively to detect the sounds of conspecifics. High-speed X-ray videos revealed how pharyngeal jaws move during sound production. Traces of erosion on teeth in the fourth ceratobranchial arch suggest that they are also involved in sound production. The similarity of motor patterns of the upper and lower pharyngeal jaws between food processing and sound production indicates that calling is an exaptation of the food-processing mechanism."},{"title":"Desiccation tolerance as a function of age, sex, humidity and temperature in adults of the African malaria vectors Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3823","abstract":"Adult mosquito survival is strongly temperature and moisture dependent.

For these reasons, the desiccation tolerance of Anopheles arabiensis Patton and Anopheles funestus Giles males and females of three different ages was assessed under three combinations of temperature and humidity. Females were more desiccation tolerant than males, surviving for longer periods than males under all experimental conditions. In addition, younger adults were more tolerant of desiccation than older groups. Both species showed reduced water loss rate (WLR) as the primary mechanism by which they tolerate desiccation. Although A. arabiensis is often considered to be the more arid-adapted of the two species, it showed lower survival times and higher WLR than A. funestus. The current information could improve population dynamic models of these vectors, given that adult survival information for such models is relatively sparse."},{"title":"Effect of repeated freeze–thaw cycles on geographically different populations of the freeze-tolerant worm Enchytraeus albidus (Oligochaeta)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3843","abstract":"Freeze-tolerant organisms survive internal ice formation; however, the adaptations to repeated freeze–thaw cycles are often not well investigated. Here we report how three geographically different populations of Enchytraeus albidus (Germany, Iceland and Svalbard) respond to three temperature treatments – constant thawed (0°C), constant freezing (−5°C) and fluctuating temperature (0 to −5°C) – over a period of 42 days. Survival varied between treatments and populations such that enchytraeids from arctic locations had a higher survival following prolonged freeze periods compared with temperate populations. However, enchytraeids from temperate locations had the same survival rate as arctic populations when exposed to repeated freeze–thaw events. Across all populations, metabolic rate decreased markedly in frozen animals (−5°C) compared with thawed controls (0°C). This decrease is likely due to the lower temperature of frozen animals, but also to the transition to the frozen state per se. Animals exposed to repeated freeze–thaw events had an intermediate metabolic rate and freeze–thaw events were not associated with pronounced excess energetic costs. Overwintering under either condition was not associated with a decrease in lipid content; however, during exposure to constant freezing and repeated freeze–thaw events there was a noticeable decrease in carbohydrate stores over time. Thus, animals exposed to constant freezing showed a decrease in glycogen stores, while both glucose and glycogen content decreased over time when the organisms were exposed to repeated freezing. The results therefore suggest that carbohydrate resources are important as a fuel for E. albidus during freezing whereas lipid resources are of marginal importance."},{"title":"Fluctuations in oxygen influence facultative endothermy in bumblebees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3834","abstract":"Bumblebees are facultative endotherms, having the ability to elevate thorax temperature above ambient temperature by elevating metabolism.

Under normoxia, bumblebees maintained an elevated mean thorax temperature of 35.5°C. There was no significant change in thorax temperature at 15 kPa O2 (33.4°C). Mean thorax temperature decreased significantly at 10 kPa O2 (31.6°C) and 5 kPa O2 (27.3°C). Bees were able to maintain an elevated metabolic rate at 15 and 10 kPa O2. In normoxia, endothermic bees exhibited periods of rapid abdominal pumping (327 min−1) interspaced by periods of no abdominal pumping. At 10 kPa O2, abdominal pumping rate decreased (255 min−1) but became more continuous. Upon exposure to 5 kPa, metabolic rate and abdominal pumping rate (152 min−1) decreased, although the animals continued abdominal pumping at the reduced rate throughout the exposure period.

We used a multilevel experimental approach to assess whether circadian rhythms modulate several aspects of the visual physiology and behavior of the praying mantis Hierodula patellifera. We used electroretinograms (ERGs) to assess compound eye sensitivity, colorimetric photographic analyses to assess compound eye color changes (screening pigment migration), behavioral assays of responsiveness to computer-generated prey-like visual stimuli and analyses of locomotor activity patterns on a modified treadmill apparatus. Our results indicate that circadian clocks control and/or modulate each of the target behaviors. Strong rhythms, persisting under constant conditions, with periods of ~24 h were evident in photoreceptor sensitivity to light, appetitive responsiveness to prey-like stimuli and gross locomotor activity. In the first two cases, responsiveness was highest during the subjective night and lowest during the subjective day. Locomotor activity was strongly clustered around the transition time from day to night. In addition, pigment migration and locomotor behavior responded strongly to light:dark cycles and anticipated the light–dark transition, suggesting that the circadian clocks modulating both were entrained to environmental light cues. Together, these data indicate that circadian rhythms operate at the cellular, cellular systems and organismal level in H. patellifera. Our results represent an intriguing first step in uncovering the complexities of circadian rhythms in the Mantodea."},{"title":"Characterization of visual pigments, oil droplets, lens and cornea in the whooping crane Grus americana","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3883","abstract":"Vision has been investigated in many species of birds, but few studies have considered the visual systems of large birds and the particular implications of large eyes and long-life spans on visual system capabilities. To address these issues we investigated the visual system of the whooping crane Grus americana (Gruiformes, Gruidae), which is one of only two North American crane species. It is a large, long-lived bird in which UV sensitivity might be reduced by chromatic aberration and entrance of UV radiation into the eye could be detrimental to retinal tissues. To investigate the whooping crane visual system we used microspectrophotometry to determine the absorbance spectra of retinal oil droplets and to investigate whether the ocular media (i.e. the lens and cornea) absorb UV radiation. In vitro expression and reconstitution was used to determine the absorbance spectra of rod and cone visual pigments. The rod visual pigments had wavelengths of peak absorbance (λmax) at 500 nm, whereas the cone visual pigment λmax values were determined to be 404 nm (SWS1), 450 nm (SWS2), 499 nm (RH2) and 561 nm (LWS), similar to other characterized bird visual pigment absorbance values. The oil droplet cut-off wavelength (λcut) values similarly fell within ranges recorded in other avian species: 576 nm (R-type), 522 nm (Y-type), 506 nm (P-type) and 448 nm (C-type). We confirm that G. americana has a violet-sensitive visual system; however, as a consequence of the λmax of the SWS1 visual pigment (404 nm), it might also have some UV sensitivity."},{"title":"Tail autotomy and subsequent regeneration alter the mechanics of locomotion in lizards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3891","abstract":"Animals can undergo significant weight change for a variety of reasons. Autotomy, the voluntary shedding of an appendage in response to a predator stimulus, provides an effective model for measuring the effects of rapid weight change on locomotor behavior and the responses to more gradual weight gain, particularly in lizards capable of both autotomizing and regenerating their tail. Although the general effects of autotomy on locomotor performance are commonly explored, we investigated changes in locomotor mechanics associated with tail loss and long-term regeneration for the first time by measuring morphology, 3D kinematics and ground reaction forces (GRFs) in the leopard gecko Eublepharis macularius. Tail autotomy resulted in a 13% anterior shift in the center of mass (CoM), which only partially recovered after full regeneration of the tail. Although no changes in body or forelimb kinematics were evident, decreases in hindlimb joint angles signify a more sprawled posture following autotomy. Changes in hindlimb GRFs resulted in an increase in weight-specific propulsive force, without a corresponding change in locomotor speed. Hindlimb kinematics and GRFs following autotomy recovered to pre-autotomy values as the tail regenerated. These results suggest an active locomotor response to tail loss that demonstrates the causal relationships between variations in morphology, kinematics and force."},{"title":"Gait models and mechanical energy in three cross-country skiing techniques","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3910","abstract":"Fluctuations in mechanical energy of the body center of mass (COM) have been widely analyzed when investigating different gaits in human and animal locomotion. We applied this approach to estimate the mechanical work in cross-country skiing and to identify the fundamental mechanisms of this particular form of locomotion. We acquired movements of body segments, skis, poles and plantar pressures for eight skiers while they roller skied on a treadmill at 14 km h−1 and a 2 deg slope using three different techniques (diagonal stride, DS; double poling, DP; double poling with kick, DK). The work associated with kinetic energy (KE) changes of COM was not different between techniques; the work against gravity associated with potential energy (PE) changes was higher for DP than for DK and was lowest for DS. Mechanical work against the external environment was 0.87 J m−1 kg−1 for DS, 0.70 J m−1 kg−1 for DP and 0.79 J m−1 kg−1 for DK. The work done to overcome frictional forces, which is negligible in walking and running, was 17.8%, 32.3% and 24.8% of external mechanical work for DS, DP and DK, respectively. The pendulum-like recovery (R%) between PE and KE was ~45%, ~26% and ~9% for DP, DK and DS, respectively, but energy losses by friction are not accounted for in this computation. The pattern of fluctuations of PE and KE indicates that DS can be described as a ‘grounded running’, where aerial phases are substituted by ski gliding phases, DP can be described as a pendular gait, whereas DK is a combination of both."},{"title":"The development of pathogen resistance in Daphnia magna: implications for disease spread in age-structured populations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3929","abstract":"Immunity in vertebrates is well established to develop with time, but the ontogeny of defence in invertebrates is markedly less studied. Yet, age-specific capacity for defence against pathogens, coupled with age structure in populations, has widespread implications for disease spread. Thus, we sought to determine the susceptibility of hosts of different ages in an experimental invertebrate host–pathogen system. In a series of experiments, we show that the ability of Daphnia magna to resist its natural bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa changes with host age. Clonal differences make it difficult to draw general conclusions, but the majority of observations indicate that resistance increases early in the life of D. magna, consistent with the idea that the defence system develops with time. Immediately following this, at about the time when a daphnid would be most heavily investing in reproduction, resistance tends to decline. Because many ecological factors influence the age structure of Daphnia populations, our results highlight a broad mechanism by which ecological context can affect disease epidemiology. We also show that a previously observed protective effect of restricted maternal food persists throughout the entire juvenile period, and that the protective effect of prior treatment with a small dose of the pathogen (‘priming’) persists for 7 days, observations that reinforce the idea that immunity in D. magna can change over time. Together, our experiments lead us to conclude that invertebrate defence capabilities have an ontogeny that merits consideration with respect to both their immune systems and the epidemic spread of infection."},{"title":"Clap and fling mechanism with interacting porous wings in tiny insect flight","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3898","abstract":"The aerodynamics of flapping flight for the smallest insects such as thrips is often characterized by a ‘clap and fling’ of the wings at the end of the upstroke and the beginning of the downstroke. These insects fly at Reynolds numbers (Re) of the order of 10 or less where viscous effects are significant. Although this wing motion is known to augment the lift generated during flight, the drag required to fling the wings apart at this scale is an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding force acting on a single wing. As the opposing forces acting normal to each wing nearly cancel during the fling, these large forces do not have a clear aerodynamic benefit. If flight efficiency is defined as the ratio of lift to drag, the clap and fling motion dramatically reduces efficiency relative to the case of wings that do not aerodynamically interact. In this paper, the effect of a bristled wing characteristic of many of these insects was investigated using computational fluid dynamics. We performed 2D numerical simulations using a porous version of the immersed boundary method. Given the computational complexity involved in modeling flow through exact descriptions of bristled wings, the wing was modeled as a homogeneous porous layer as a first approximation. High-speed video recordings of free-flying thrips in take-off flight were captured in the laboratory, and an analysis of the wing kinematics was performed. This information was used for the estimation of input parameters for the simulations. Compared with a solid wing (without bristles), the results of the study show that the porous nature of the wings contributes largely to drag reduction across the Re range explored. The aerodynamic efficiency, calculated as the ratio of lift to drag coefficients, was larger for some porosities when compared with solid wings."},{"title":"Unpredictable chronic stress decreases inhibitory avoidance learning in Tuebingen long-fin zebrafish: stronger effects in the resting phase than in the active phase","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3919","abstract":"Zebrafish (Danio rerio Hamilton) are increasingly used as a model to study the effects of chronic stress on brain and behaviour. In rodents, unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) has a stronger effect on physiology and behaviour during the active phase than during the resting phase. Here, we applied UCS during the daytime (active phase) for 7 and 14 days or during the night-time (resting phase) for 7 nights in an in-house-reared Tuebingen long-fin (TLF) zebrafish strain. Following UCS, inhibitory avoidance learning was assessed using a 3 day protocol where fish learn to avoid swimming from a white to a black compartment where they will receive a 3 V shock. Latencies of entering the black compartment were recorded before training (day 1; first shock) and after training on day 2 (second shock) and day 3 (no shock, tissue sampling). Fish whole-body cortisol content and expression levels of genes related to stress, fear and anxiety in the telencephalon were quantified. Following 14 days of UCS during the day, inhibitory avoidance learning decreased (lower latencies on days 2 and 3); minor effects were found following 7 days of UCS. Following 7 nights of UCS, inhibitory avoidance learning decreased (lower latency on day 3). Whole-body cortisol levels showed a steady increase compared with controls (100%) from 7 days of UCS (139%), to 14 days of UCS (174%) to 7 nights of UCS (231%), suggestive of an increasing stress load. Only in the 7 nights of UCS group did expression levels of corticoid receptor genes (mr, grα, grβ) and of bdnf increase. These changes are discussed as adaptive mechanisms to maintain neuronal integrity and prevent overload, and as being indicative of a state of high stress load. Overall, our data suggest that stressors during the resting phase have a stronger impact than during the active phase. Our data warrant further studies on the effect of UCS on stress axis-related genes, especially grβ; in mammals this receptor has been implicated in glucocorticoid resistance and depression."},{"title":"Bitter stimuli modulate the feeding decision of a blood-sucking insect via two sensory inputs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3708","abstract":"The gustatory system of animals is involved in food quality assessment and controls the feeding decision of an individual confronted with a potential alimentary source. Triatomines are haematophagous insects that feed on vertebrate blood. Once they reach a potential host, they walk over the host skin searching for an adequate site to pierce. Then, they insert their stylets and take a first sampling gorge to decide whether food is acceptable. Our work reveals that the presence of bitter compounds inhibits the feeding behavior of these bugs. Firstly, triatomines decreased their feeding behavior if substrates spread with quinine or caffeine were detected by external receptors localized exclusively in the antennae. Morphological inspections along with electrophysiological recordings revealed the existence of four gustatory sensilla located in the tip of the antenna that respond to both bitter tastants. The absence of these bitter detectors by antennal ablation reversed the observed feeding inhibition evoked by bitter compounds. Secondly, once triatomines pumped the first volume of food with bitter compounds (quinine, caffeine, berberine, salicin), a decrease in their feeding behavior was observed. Morphological inspections revealed the existence of eight gustatory sensilla located in the pharynx that might be responsible for the internal bitter detection. Finally, we found that a brief pre-exposure to bitter compounds negatively modulates the motivation of bugs to feed on an appetitive solution. Results presented here highlight the relevance of bitter taste perception in the modulation of the feeding behavior of a blood-sucking insect."},{"title":"Anatomical and physiological studies of bigheaded carps demonstrate that the epibranchial organ functions as a pharyngeal taste organ","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3945","abstract":"The epibranchial organ (EO) is an enigmatic tubular organ found in the pharyngeal cavity of many filter-feeding fishes. We investigated whether it might function as a taste organ that mediates aggregation and ingestion of planktonic food within the buccal cavity. The EO and associated structures of bighead and silver carps, two successful and invasive planktivorous fishes, were examined using histological and electrophysiological techniques. Both species possess finely structured gill rakers that extend directly via a series of protrusions into each of the four blind canals which are organized as the muscular EO, suggesting that the gill rakers and EO probably function in an integrated manner. Both the interior and exterior surfaces of the EOs of both species are covered with high densities of taste buds and solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) as well as mucous cells. Conversely, taste buds are scarce in both the buccal cavities and external portions of the head and mouth of both species. Electrophysiological recordings from a caudal branch of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) found to innervate the EO showed it to be sensitive to chemicals found in a planktonic diet. l-Amino acids accounted for some, but not all of the neural activity. We conclude that taste buds and SCCs located on the EO and gill rakers probably serve to chemically detect food particles, which the EO then aggregates by mucus secretion before eventually expelling them onto the floor of the pharynx for ingestion. This specialized, pharyngeal chemosensory structure may explain the feeding success of these, and perhaps other planktivorous, filter-feeding fishes."},{"title":"Contextual modulation of a multifunctional central pattern generator","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/21/3935","abstract":"The multifunctional buccal central pattern generator in snails, which controls different oral behaviors, has been well characterized.

We characterize these cells based on location and morphology, and provide evidence for their selective activation under two different stimuli – Listerine perfusion and intestinal nerve stimulation – triggering buccal motor patterns putatively underlying egestion and substrate cleaning. A new role for these electrotonically coupled buccal A cluster neurons is shown. They serve as a context-dependant switch that alters buccal motor patterns depending on input stimuli, thereby eliciting the appropriate behavioral response."},{"title":"Disruption of insulin signalling affects the neuroendocrine stress reaction in Drosophila females","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3733","abstract":"Juvenile hormone (JH) and dopamine are involved in the stress response in insects. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway has also recently been found to be involved in the regulation of various processes, including stress tolerance. However, the relationships between the JH, dopamine and insulin signalling pathways remain unclear. Here, we study the role of insulin signalling in the regulation of JH and dopamine metabolism under normal and heat stress conditions in Drosophila melanogaster females. We show that suppression of the insulin-like receptor (InR) in the corpus allatum, a specialised endocrine gland that synthesises JH, causes an increase in dopamine level and JH-hydrolysing activity and alters the activities of enzymes that produce as well as those that degrade dopamine [alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-dependent arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (DAT)]. We also found that InR suppression in the corpus allatum modulates dopamine, ALP, TH and JH-hydrolysing activity in response to heat stress and that it decreases the fecundity of the flies. JH application restores dopamine metabolism and fecundity in females with decreased InR expression in the corpus allatum. Our data provide evidence that the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway regulates dopamine metabolism in females of D. melanogaster via the system of JH metabolism and that it affects the development of the neuroendocrine stress reaction and interacts with JH in the control of reproduction in this species."},{"title":"Reduce torques and stick the landing: limb posture during landing in toads","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3742","abstract":"A controlled landing, where an animal does not crash or topple, requires enough stability to allow muscles to effectively dissipate mechanical energy. Toads (Rhinella marina) are exemplary models for understanding the mechanics and motor control of landing given their ability to land consistently during bouts of continuous hopping. Previous studies in anurans have shown that ground reaction forces (GRFs) during landing are significantly higher compared with takeoff and can potentially impart large torques about the center of mass (COM), destabilizing the body at impact. We predict that in order to minimize such torques, toads will align their COM with the GRF vector during the aerial phase in anticipation of impact. We combined high-speed videography and force-plate ergometry to quantify torques at the COM and relate the magnitude of torques to limb posture at impact. We show that modulation of hindlimb posture can shift the position of the COM by about 20% of snout–vent length. Rapid hindlimb flexion during the aerial phase of a hop moved the COM anteriorly and reduced torque by aligning the COM with the GRF vector. We found that the addition of extrinsic loads did not significantly alter landing behavior but did change the torques experienced at impact. We conclude that anticipatory hindlimb flexion during the aerial phase of a hop is a critical feature of a mechanically stable landing that allows toads to quickly string together multiple, continuous hops."},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake. XXII. Reproductive performance of two selected mouse lines with different thermal conductance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3718","abstract":"Maximal sustained energy intake (SusEI) appears limited, but the factors imposing the limit are disputed. We studied reproductive performance in two lines of mice selected for high and low food intake (MH and ML, respectively), and known to have large differences in thermal conductance (29% higher in the MH line at 21°C). When these mice raised their natural litters, their metabolisable energy intake significantly increased over the first 13 days of lactation and then reached a plateau. At peak lactation, MH mice assimilated on average 45.3% more energy than ML mice (222.9±7.1 and 153.4±12.5 kJ day−1, N=49 and 24, respectively). Moreover, MH mice exported on average 62.3 kJ day−1 more energy as milk than ML mice (118.9±5.3 and 56.6±5.4 kJ day−1, N=subset of 32 and 21, respectively). The elevated milk production of MH mice enabled them to wean litters (65.2±2.1 g) that were on average 50.2% heavier than litters produced by ML mothers (43.4±3.0 g), and pups that were on average 27.2% heavier (9.9±0.2 and 7.8±0.2 g, respectively). Lactating mice in both lines had significantly longer and heavier guts compared with non-reproductive mice. However, inconsistent with the ‘central limit hypothesis’, the ML mice had significantly longer and heavier intestines than MH mice. An experiment where the mice raised litters of the opposing line demonstrated that lactation performance was not limited by the growth capacity of offspring. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the SusEI at peak lactation is constrained by the capacity of the mothers to dissipate body heat."},{"title":"Suction feeding across fish life stages: flow dynamics from larvae to adults and implications for prey capture","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3748","abstract":"Suction feeding is thought to be the primary mode of prey capture in most larval fishes. Similar to adult suction feeders, larvae swim towards their prey while rapidly expanding their mouth cavity to generate an inward flow of water that draws the prey into the mouth. Although larvae are known to experience flows with lower Reynolds numbers than adults, it is unclear how the suction-induced flow field changes throughout ontogeny, and how such changes relate to prey capture performance. To address these questions, we determined mouth dimensions and opening speeds in Sparus aurata from first-feeding larvae to adults. We proceeded to develop a computational model of mouth expansion in order to analyze the scaling of suction flows under the observed parameters. Larval fish produced suction flows that were around two orders of magnitude slower than those of adults. Compared with adult fish, in which flow speed decays steeply with distance in front of the mouth, flow speed decayed more gradually in larval fish. This difference indicates that viscous forces in low Reynolds number flows modify the spatial distribution flow speed in front of the mouth. Consequently, simulated predator–prey encounters showed that larval fish could capture inert prey from a greater distance compared with adults. However, if prey attempted to escape then larval fish performed poorly: simulations inferred capture success in only weakly escaping prey immediately in front of the mouth. These ontogenetic changes in Reynolds number, suction-induced flow field and feeding performance could explain a widespread ontogenetic diet shift from passive prey at early life stages to evasive prey as larvae mature."},{"title":"The relationship between cardiopulmonary size and aerobic performance in adult deer mice at high altitude","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3758","abstract":"Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus sonoriensis) populations in the White Mountains of Eastern California are found across a substantial range of partial pressures of oxygen (PO2).

More than two-thirds of cleaner fishes display this behavior predominately as juveniles and discontinue cleaning as adults; such species are here referred to as ‘facultative cleaners’. Whether allometric changes in morphological traits coincide with ontogenetic shifts away from cleaning is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that transitions away from cleaning are associated with scaling patterns in the feeding apparatus of facultative cleaners, and then compared such patterns with those exhibited by non-cleaner congeners. We measured functional traits related to feeding, such as vertical gape distance, premaxillary protrusion distance and maxillary kinematic transmission coefficient (KT) in each ontogenetic series of 11 Thalassoma wrasses (Labridae). As these fishes predominately capture prey via biting, we modeled bite force using MandibLever (v3.3) to create an ontogenetic trajectory of bite force for each species. Our results indicate that cleaner fishes in Thalassoma, as juveniles, possess jaws with low mobility that exhibit weaker bite forces. Additionally, there was remarkable consistency in the range of body lengths over which we observed significant differences between facultative cleaners and non-cleaners in bite force, vertical gape distance and premaxillary protrusion distance. Through ontogeny, facultative cleaner fishes exhibit positive allometry for a number of functionally important feeding traits, which possibly obviates the need to continue cleaning."},{"title":"Body temperature stability achieved by the large body mass of sea turtles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3607","abstract":"To investigate the thermal characteristics of large reptiles living in water, temperature data were continuously recorded from 16 free-ranging loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta, during internesting periods using data loggers. Core body temperatures were 0.7–1.7°C higher than ambient water temperatures and were kept relatively constant. Unsteady numerical simulations using a spherical thermodynamic model provided mechanistic explanations for these phenomena, and the body temperature responses to fluctuating water temperature can be simply explained by a large body mass with a constant thermal diffusivity and a heat production rate rather than physiological thermoregulation. By contrast, body temperatures increased 2.6–5.1°C in 107–152 min during their emergences to nest on land. The estimated heat production rates on land were 7.4–10.5 times the calculated values in the sea. The theoretical prediction that temperature difference between body and water temperatures would increase according to the body size was confirmed by empirical data recorded from several species of sea turtles. Comparing previously reported data, the internesting intervals of leatherback, green and loggerhead turtles were shorter when the body temperatures were higher. Sea turtles seem to benefit from a passive thermoregulatory strategy, which depends primarily on the physical attributes of their large body masses."},{"title":"Titin force is enhanced in actively stretched skeletal muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3629","abstract":"The sliding filament theory of muscle contraction is widely accepted as the means by which muscles generate force during activation. Within the constraints of this theory, isometric, steady-state force produced during muscle activation is proportional to the amount of filament overlap. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated enhanced titin-based force in myofibrils that were actively stretched to lengths which exceeded filament overlap. This observation cannot be explained by the sliding filament theory. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the enhanced state of titin during active stretch. Specifically, we confirm that this enhanced state of force is observed in a mouse model and quantify the contribution of calcium to this force. Titin-based force was increased by up to four times that of passive force during active stretch of isolated myofibrils. Enhanced titin-based force has now been demonstrated in two distinct animal models, suggesting that modulation of titin-based force during active stretch is an inherent property of skeletal muscle. Our results also demonstrated that 15% of the enhanced state of titin can be attributed to direct calcium effects on the protein, presumably a stiffening of the protein upon calcium binding to the E-rich region of the PEVK segment and selected Ig domain segments. We suggest that the remaining unexplained 85% of this extra force results from titin binding to the thin filament. With this enhanced force confirmed in the mouse model, future studies will aim to elucidate the proposed titin–thin filament interaction in actively stretched sarcomeres."},{"title":"Enhanced sensory sampling precedes self-initiated locomotion in an electric fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3615","abstract":"Cortical activity precedes self-initiated movements by several seconds in mammals; this observation has led into inquiries on the nature of volition. Preparatory neural activity is known to be associated with decision making and movement planning. Self-initiated locomotion has been linked to increased active sensory sampling; however, the precise temporal relationship between sensory acquisition and voluntary movement initiation has not been established. Based on long-term monitoring of sensory sampling activity that is readily observable in freely behaving pulse-type electric fish, we show that heightened sensory acquisition precedes spontaneous initiation of swimming. Gymnotus sp. revealed a bimodal distribution of electric organ discharge rate (EODR) demonstrating down- and up-states of sensory sampling and neural activity; movements only occurred during up-states and up-states were initiated before movement onset. EODR during voluntary swimming initiation exhibited greater trial-to-trial variability than the sound-evoked increases in EODR. The sampling variability declined after voluntary movement onset as previously observed for the neural variability associated with decision making in primates. Spontaneous movements occurred randomly without a characteristic timescale, and no significant temporal correlation was found between successive movement intervals. Using statistical analyses of spontaneous exploratory behaviours and associated preparatory sensory sampling increase, we conclude that electric fish exhibit key attributes of volitional movements, and that voluntary behaviours in vertebrates may generally be preceded by increased sensory sampling. Our results suggest that comparative studies of the neural basis of volition may therefore be possible in pulse-type electric fish, given the substantial homologies between the telencephali of teleost fish and mammals."},{"title":"Do all frogs swim alike?

Here, we examine the kinematics of swimming in eight species of frog with different ecologies. We use cineradiography to quantify movements of skeletal elements from the entire appendicular skeleton. Our results show that species with different ecologies do differ in the kinematics of swimming, with the speed of limb extension and especially the kinematics of the midfoot being different. Our results moreover suggest that this is not a phylogenetic effect because species from different clades with similar ecologies converge on the same swimming kinematics. We conclude that it is important to analyze frog locomotion in a broader ecological and evolutionary context if one is to understand the evolutionary origins of this behavior."},{"title":"Orchestration of salivary secretion mediated by two different dopamine receptors in the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3656","abstract":"Salivary secretion is crucial for successful tick feeding, and it is the mediator of pathogen transmission. Salivation functions to inhibit various components of the host immune system and remove excess water and ions during the ingestion of large blood meals. Control of salivary glands involves autocrine/paracrine dopamine, which is the most potent inducer of tick salivation. Previously, we reported the presence of two dopamine receptors in the salivary glands of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis): dopamine receptor (D1) and invertebrate specific D1-like dopamine receptor (InvD1L). Here, we investigated the different physiological roles of the dopamine receptors in tick salivary glands by using pharmacological tools that discriminate between the two distinct receptors. Heterologous expressions followed by reporter assays of the dopamine receptors identified receptor-specific antagonists and agonists. These pharmacological tools were further used to discriminate the physiological role of each receptor by using in vitro assays: measuring salivary secretions of isolated salivary glands and monitoring dynamic changes in the size of individual salivary gland acini. We propose that the D1 receptor acts on salivary gland acini epithelial cells for inward fluid transport. InvD1L controls (or modulates) each acinus for expelling saliva from the acini to the salivary ducts, presumably through the actions of myoepithelial cells and valves for pumping/gating. We conclude that dopamine acts on the D1 and the InvD1L receptors and leads different physiological actions to orchestrate tick salivary secretion."},{"title":"Thermoregulatory strategy may shape immune investment in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3664","abstract":"As temperatures change, insects alter the amount of melanin in their cuticle to improve thermoregulation. However, melanin is also central to insect immunity, suggesting that thermoregulatory strategy may indirectly impact immune defense by altering the abundance of melanin pathway components (a hypothesis we refer to as thermoregulatory-dependent immune investment). This may be the case in the cricket Allonemobius socius, where warm environments (both seasonal and geographical) produced crickets with lighter cuticles and increased pathogen susceptibility. Unfortunately, the potential for thermoregulatory strategy to influence insect immunity has not been widely explored. Here we address the relationships between temperature, thermoregulatory strategy and immunity in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. To this end, flies from two separate Canadian populations were reared in either a summer- or autumn-like environment. Shortly after adult eclosion, flies were moved to a common environment where their cuticle color and susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were measured. As with A. socius, individuals from summer-like environments exhibited lighter cuticles and increased pathogen susceptibility, suggesting that the thermoregulatory–immunity relationship is evolutionarily conserved across the hemimetabolous and holometabolous clades. If global temperatures continue to rise as expected, then thermoregulation might play an important role in host infection and mortality rates in systems that provide critical ecosystem services (e.g. pollination), or influence the prevalence of insect-vectored disease (e.g. malaria)."},{"title":"Compound valence is conserved in binary odor mixtures in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3645","abstract":"Most naturally occurring olfactory signals do not consist of monomolecular odorants but, rather, are mixtures whose composition and concentration ratios vary. While there is ample evidence for the relevance of complex odor blends in ecological interactions and for interactions of chemicals in both peripheral and central neuronal processing, a fine-scale analysis of rules governing the innate behavioral responses of Drosophila melanogaster towards odor mixtures is lacking. In this study we examine whether the innate valence of odors is conserved in binary odor mixtures. We show that binary mixtures of attractants are more attractive than individual mixture constituents. In contrast, mixing attractants with repellents elicits responses that are lower than the responses towards the corresponding attractants. This decrease in attraction is repellent-specific, independent of the identity of the attractant and more stereotyped across individuals than responses towards the repellent alone. Mixtures of repellents are either less attractive than the individual mixture constituents or these mixtures represent an intermediate. Within the limits of our data set, most mixture responses are quantitatively predictable on the basis of constituent responses. In summary, the valence of binary odor mixtures is predictable on the basis of valences of mixture constituents. Our findings will further our understanding of innate behavior towards ecologically relevant odor blends and will serve as a powerful tool for deciphering the olfactory valence code."},{"title":"Arginine vasotocin, steroid hormones and social behavior in the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3670","abstract":"Arginine vasotocin (AVT) is a potent regulator of social behavior in many species, but little is known about its role in reptilian behavior.

Aggressive behavior was stimulated in two ways: (1) mirror presentation (no relative status formed) and (2) size-matched pairs (where a social status is achieved). To elicit courtship behavior, a novel female was introduced into the home cage of a male. Regardless of the behavior condition, male anoles were injected i.p. with either reptile Ringer solution (vehicle) or AVT prior to testing. Animals treated with AVT performed fewer aggressive display bouts during mirror presentation but AVT treatment did not affect the overall number of aggressive display bouts within size-matched pairs. Male courtship behavior was not affected by AVT; however, untreated females displayed more frequently when paired with an AVT-treated male than a vehicle-injected control, suggesting that AVT-treated males were more attractive to females. Regardless of behavior condition, AVT injections led to increases in circulating corticosterone. Overall, we found that AVT tended to reduce aggressive behavior as has been reported for other territorial species. AVT did not perceptibly alter male courtship but did increase the display behavior of untreated females paired with treated males.

According to the Dahlquist criterion, adhesive organs must be very soft, exhibiting an effective Young's modulus of below 100 kPa to adhere well to substrates. Such a low effective Young's modulus allows the adhesive organs to make almost direct contact with the substrate and results in van der Waals forces along with capillary forces. In previous studies, the effective Young's moduli of adhesive organs were determined using indentation tests, revealing their structure to be very soft. However, adhesive organs show a layered structure, thus the measured values comprise the effective Young's moduli of several layers of the adhesive organs. In this study, a new approach is illustrated to measure the Young's modulus of the outermost layer of the arolium, i.e. of the epicuticle, of the stick insect Carausius morosus. As a result of the epicuticle being supported by upright fibres, tensile tests allow the determination of the Young's modulus of the epicuticle with hardly influence from subjacent layers. In our tensile tests, arolia of stick insects adhering on a latex membrane were stretched by stretching the membrane while the elongation of the contact area between an arolium and the membrane was recorded. For analysis, mathematical models of the mechanical system were developed. When fed with the observed elongations, these models yield estimates for the Young's modulus of the epicuticle of approximately 100 MPa. Thus, in arolia, a very thin layer (~225 nm) of a rather stiff material, which is less susceptible to abrasion, makes contact with the substrates, whereas the inner fibrous structure of arolia is responsible for their softness."},{"title":"Electromyographic analysis of goal-directed grasping behavior in the American lobster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3688","abstract":"Animals spontaneously initiate goal-directed behavior including foraging action based on their appetitive motivation. The American lobster Homarus americanus exhibits grasping behavior with its crusher claw as feeding behavior that can be initiated after appropriate operant conditioning. In order to quantitatively characterize the goal-directed grasping behavior with a time resolution fine enough for neurophysiological analysis of its initiation and control mechanisms, we made simultaneous electromyographic (EMG) recording from grasping- and reaching-related muscles of the crusher claw while animals initiated grasping behavior. We developed an in vivo extracellular recording chamber that allowed the animal under a semi-restrained condition to perform operant reward learning of claw grasping. Three muscles in the crusher claw (propodite-dactyl closer/opener and coxal protractor) were found to be closely associated with spontaneous grasping behavior. In spontaneous grasping, the activation of those muscles consistently preceded the grasping onset time and exhibited different activity patterns from the grasp induced by a mechanical stimulus. Furthermore, we found that the timing of coxal protractor activation was closer to the grasp onset and its activity was briefer for goal-directed grasping behavior in trained and hungry animals than for non-goal-directed spontaneous grasping behavior in naive or satiated animals. It is suggested that the goal-directed grasping behavior of lobster is characterized, at least partly, by experience-dependent briefer activity of specific muscles involved in reaching action."},{"title":"Impacts of extreme climatic events on the energetics of long-lived vertebrates: the case of the greater flamingo facing cold spells in the Camargue","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/20/3700","abstract":"Most studies analyzing the effects of global warming on wild populations focus on gradual temperature changes, yet it is also important to understand the impact of extreme climatic events. Here we studied the effect of two cold spells (January 1985 and February 2012) on the energetics of greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) in the Camargue (southern France). To understand the cause of observed flamingo mass mortalities, we first assessed the energy stores of flamingos found dead in February 2012, and compared them with those found in other bird species exposed to cold spells and/or fasting. Second, we evaluated the monthly energy requirements of flamingos across 1980–2012 using the mechanistic model Niche Mapper™. Our results show that the body lipids of flamingos found dead in 2012 corresponded to 2.6±0.3% of total body mass, which is close to results found in woodcocks (Scolopax rusticola) that died from starvation during a cold spell (1.7±0.1%), and much lower than in woodcocks which were fed throughout this same cold spell (13.0±2%). Further, Niche Mapper™ predicted that flamingo energy requirements were highest (+6–7%) during the 1985 and 2012 cold spells compared with ‘normal’ winters. This increase was primarily driven by cold air temperatures. Overall, our findings strongly suggest that flamingos starved to death during both cold spells. This study demonstrates the relevance of using mechanistic energetics modelling and body condition analyses to understand and predict the impact of extreme climatic events on animal energy balance and winter survival probabilities."},{"title":"A hierarchy of factors influence discontinuous gas exchange in the grasshopper Paracinema tricolor (Orthoptera: Acrididae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3407","abstract":"The evolutionary origin and maintenance of discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) in tracheate arthropods are poorly understood and highly controversial. We investigated prioritization of abiotic factors in the gas exchange control cascade by examining oxygen, water and haemolymph pH regulation in the grasshopper Paracinema tricolor. Using a full-factorial design, grasshoppers were acclimated to hypoxic or hyperoxic (5% O2, 40% O2) gas conditions, or dehydrated or hydrated, whereafter their CO2 release was measured under a range of O2 and relative humidity (RH) conditions (5%, 21%, 40% O2 and 5%, 60%, 90% RH). DGE was significantly less common in grasshoppers acclimated to dehydrating conditions compared with the other acclimations (hypoxia, 98%; hyperoxia, 100%; hydrated, 100%; dehydrated, 67%). Acclimation to dehydrating conditions resulted in a significant decrease in haemolymph pH from 7.0±0.3 to 6.6±0.1 (mean ± s.d., P=0.018) and also significantly increased the open (O)-phase duration under 5% O2 treatment conditions (5% O2, 44.1±29.3 min; 40% O2, 15.8±8.0 min; 5% RH, 17.8±1.3 min; 60% RH, 24.0±9.7 min; 90% RH, 20.6±8.9 min). The observed acidosis could potentially explain the extension of the O-phase under low RH conditions, when it would perhaps seem more useful to reduce the O-phase to lower respiratory water loss. The results confirm that DGE occurrence and modulation are affected by multiple abiotic factors. A hierarchical framework for abiotic factors influencing DGE is proposed in which the following stressors are prioritized in decreasing order of importance: oxygen supply, CO2 excretion and pH modulation, oxidative damage protection and water savings."},{"title":"High or low dietary carbohydrate:protein ratios during first-feeding affect glucose metabolism and intestinal microbiota in juvenile rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3396","abstract":"Based on the concept of nutritional programming in mammals, we tested whether an acute hyperglucidic–hypoproteic stimulus during first feeding could induce long-term changes in nutrient metabolism in rainbow trout. Trout alevins received during the five first days of exogenous feeding either a hyperglucidic (40% gelatinized starch + 20% glucose) and hypoproteic (20%) diet (VLP diet) or a high-protein (60%) glucose-free diet (HP diet, control). Following a common 105-day period on a commercial diet, both groups were then challenged (65 days) with a carbohydrate-rich diet (28%). Short- and long-term effects of the early stimuli were evaluated in terms of metabolic marker gene expressions and intestinal microbiota as initial gut colonisation is essential for regulating the development of the digestive system. In whole alevins (short term), diet VLP relative to HP rapidly increased gene expressions of glycolytic enzymes, while those involved in gluconeogenesis and amino acid catabolism decreased. However, none of these genes showed persistent molecular adaptation in the liver of challenged juveniles (long term). By contrast, muscle of challenged juveniles subjected previously to the VLP stimulus displayed downregulated expression of markers of glycolysis and glucose transport (not seen in the short term). These fish also had higher plasma glucose (9 h postprandial), suggesting impaired glucose homeostasis induced by the early stimulus. The early stimulus did not modify the expression of the analysed metabolism-related microRNAs, but had short- and long-term effects on intestinal fungi (not bacteria) profiles. In summary, our data show that a short hyperglucidic–hypoproteic stimulus during early life may have a long-term influence on muscle glucose metabolism and intestinal microbiota in trout."},{"title":"Parasitic and immune modulation of flight activity in honey bees tracked with optical counters","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3416","abstract":"Host–parasite interactions are often characterized by changes in the host behaviour, which are beneficial to either the parasite or the host, or are a non-adaptive byproduct of parasitism. These interactions are further complicated in animal society because individual fitness is associated with group performance. However, a better understanding of host–parasite interaction in animal society first requires the identification of individual host behavioural modification. Therefore, we challenged honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers with the parasite Nosema ceranae or an immune stimulation and tracked their flight activity over their lifetime with an optic counter. We found that bees responded differently to each stress: both Nosema-infected and immune-challenged bees performed a lower number of daily flights compared with control bees, but the duration of their flights increased and decreased over time, respectively. Overall, parasitized bees spent more time in the field each day than control bees, and the inverse was true for immune-challenged bees. Despite the stress of immune challenge, bees had a survival similar to that of control bees likely because of their restricted activity. We discuss how those different behavioural modifications could be adaptive phenotypes. This study provides new insights into how biological stress can affect the behaviour of individuals living in society and how host responses have evolved."},{"title":"Out of the blue: the evolution of horizontally polarized signals in Haptosquilla (Crustacea, Stomatopoda, Protosquillidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3425","abstract":"The polarization of light provides information that is used by many animals for a number of different visually guided behaviours. Several marine species, such as stomatopod crustaceans and cephalopod molluscs, communicate using visual signals that contain polarized information, content that is often part of a more complex multi-dimensional visual signal. In this work, we investigate the evolution of polarized signals in species of Haptosquilla, a widespread genus of stomatopod, as well as related protosquillids. We present evidence for a pre-existing bias towards horizontally polarized signal content and demonstrate that the properties of the polarization vision system in these animals increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. Combining these results with the increase in efficacy that polarization provides over intensity and hue in a shallow marine environment, we propose a joint framework for the evolution of the polarized form of these complex signals based on both efficacy-driven (proximate) and content-driven (ultimate) selection pressures."},{"title":"A superfast muscle in the complex sonic apparatus of Ophidion rochei (Ophidiiformes): histological and physiological approaches","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3432","abstract":"In teleosts, superfast muscles are generally associated with the swimbladder wall, whose vibrations result in sound production. In Ophidion rochei, three pairs of muscles were named ‘sonic’ because their contractions affect swimbladder position: the dorsal sonic muscle (DSM), the intermediate sonic muscle (ISM), and the ventral sonic muscle (VSM). These muscles were investigated thanks to electron microscopy and electromyography in order to determine their function in sound production. Fibers of the VSM and DSM were much thinner than the fibers of the ISM and epaxial musculature. However, only VSM fibers had the typical ultrastructure of superfast muscles: low proportion of myofibrils, and high proportions of sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. In females, each sound onset was preceded by the onset of electrical activity in the VSM and the DSM (ISM was not tested). The electromyograms of the VSM were very similar to the waveforms of the sounds: means for the pulse period were 3.6±0.5 and 3.6±0.7 ms, respectively. This shows that the fast VSM (ca. 280 Hz) is responsible for the pulse period and fundamental frequency of female sounds. DSM electromyograms were generally characterized by one or two main peaks followed by periods of lower electrical activity, which suggests a sustained contraction over the course of the sound. The fiber morphology of the ISM and its antagonistic position relative to the DSM are not indicative of a muscle capable of superfast contractions. Overall, this study experimentally shows the complexity of the sound production mechanism in the nocturnal fish O. rochei."},{"title":"Two inhibitors of the ubiquitin proteasome system enhance long-term memory formation upon olfactory conditioning in the honeybee (Apis mellifera)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3441","abstract":"In honeybees (Apis mellifera), the proteasome inhibitor Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO (MG132) enhances long-term memory (LTM) formation. Studies in vertebrates using different inhibitors of the proteasome demonstrate the opposite, namely an inhibition of memory formation. The reason for this contradiction remains unclear. MG132 is an inhibitor of the proteasome, but also blocks other proteases. Accordingly, one possible explanation might be that other proteases affected by MG132 are responsible for the enhancement of LTM formation. We test this hypothesis by comparing the effect of MG132 and the more specific proteasome inhibitor clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone (β-lactone). We show that these two inhibitors block the activity of the proteasome in honeybee brains to a similar extent, do not affect the animals' survival but do enhance LTM retention upon olfactory conditioning. Thus, the enhancement of LTM formation is not due to MG132-specific side effects, but to inhibition of a protease targeted by MG132 and β-lactone, i.e. the proteasome."},{"title":"Effects of field-realistic doses of glyphosate on honeybee appetitive behaviour","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3457","abstract":"Glyphosate (GLY) is a broad-spectrum herbicide used for weed control. The sub-lethal impact of GLY on non-target organisms such as insect pollinators has not yet been evaluated. Apis mellifera is the main pollinator in agricultural environments and is a well-known model for behavioural research. Honeybees are also accurate biosensors of environmental pollutants and their appetitive behavioural response is a suitable tool with which to test sub-lethal effects of agrochemicals. We studied the effects of field-realistic doses of GLY on honeybees exposed chronically or acutely to the herbicide. We focused on sucrose sensitivity, elemental and non-elemental associative olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), and foraging-related behaviour. We found a reduced sensitivity to sucrose and learning performance for the groups chronically exposed to GLY concentrations within the range of recommended doses. When olfactory PER conditioning was performed with sucrose reward with the same GLY concentrations (acute exposure), elemental learning and short-term memory retention decreased significantly compared with controls. Non-elemental associative learning was also impaired by an acute exposure to GLY traces. Altogether, these results imply that GLY at concentrations found in agro-ecosystems as a result of standard spraying can reduce sensitivity to nectar reward and impair associative learning in honeybees. However, no effect on foraging-related behaviour was found. Therefore, we speculate that successful forager bees could become a source of constant inflow of nectar with GLY traces that could then be distributed among nestmates, stored in the hive and have long-term negative consequences on colony performance."},{"title":"Functional subdivision of fin protractor and retractor muscles underlies pelvic fin walking in the African lungfish Protopterus annectens","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3474","abstract":"African lungfish Protopterus annectens can produce rotational movements around the joint between the pelvis and the pelvic fin, allowing these animals to walk across benthic substrates. In tetrapods, limb rotation at the hip joint is a common feature of substrate-based locomotion. For sprawling tetrapods, rotation can involve nine or more muscles, which are often robust and span multiple joints. In contrast, P. annectens uses a modest morphology of two fan-shaped muscles, the pelvic fin protractor and retractor, to accomplish this movement. We hypothesized that functional subdivision, coupled with their broad insertions on the femur, allows each of these muscles to pull on the limb from multiple directions and provides a mechanism for fin rotation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the muscle activity at three locations in both the protractor and the retractor muscles during walking. Electromyograms show differences in the timing of muscle activation between dorsal and ventral regions of each muscle, suggesting that each muscle is functionally subdivided once. The subdivisions demonstrate sequential onsets of muscle activity and overlap of activity between regions, which are also features of limb control in tetrapods. These data indicate that subdivisions of protractor and retractor muscles impart functional complexity to a morphologically simple system, and suggest a mechanism that allows lungfish to produce a tetrapod-like walking gait with only two muscles. As one of few extant sarcopterygian fishes, P. annectens may provide important functional data to inform interpretation of limb movement of fossil relatives."},{"title":"Food searching behaviour of a Lepidoptera pest species is modulated by the foraging gene polymorphism","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3465","abstract":"The extent of damage to crop plants from pest insects depends on the foraging behaviour of the insect's feeding stage. Little is known, however, about the genetic and molecular bases of foraging behaviour in phytophagous pest insects. The foraging gene (for), a candidate gene encoding a PKG-I, has an evolutionarily conserved function in feeding strategies. Until now, for had never been studied in Lepidoptera, which includes major pest species. The cereal stem borer Sesamia nonagrioides is therefore a relevant species within this order with which to study conservation of and polymorphism in the for gene, and its role in foraging – a behavioural trait that is directly associated with plant injuries. Full sequencing of for cDNA in S. nonagrioides revealed a high degree of conservation with other insect taxa. Activation of PKG by a cGMP analogue increased larval foraging activity, measured by how frequently larvae moved between food patches in an actimeter. We found one non-synonymous allelic variation in a natural population that defined two allelic variants. These variants presented significantly different levels of foraging activity, and the behaviour was positively correlated to gene expression levels. Our results show that for gene function is conserved in this species of Lepidoptera, and describe an original case of a single nucleotide polymorphism associated with foraging behaviour variation in a pest insect. By illustrating how variation in this single gene can predict phenotype, this work opens new perspectives into the evolutionary context of insect adaptation to plants, as well as pest management."},{"title":"Effects of body size on the oxygen sensitivity of dragonfly flight","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3447","abstract":"One hypothesis for the small size of insects relative to vertebrates, and the existence of giant fossil insects, is that atmospheric oxygen levels constrain insect body sizes because oxygen delivery is more challenging in larger insects. This study tested this hypothesis in dragonflies by measuring the oxygen sensitivity of flight metabolic rates and behavior during hovering for 11 species of dragonflies that ranged in mass by an order of magnitude. We measured flight times and flight metabolic rates in seven oxygen concentrations ranging from 30% to 2.5% to assess the sensitivity of their flight to atmospheric oxygen. We also assessed the oxygen sensitivity of flight in low-density air (nitrogen replaced with helium) in order to increase the metabolic demands of hovering flight. Lowered atmospheric densities did induce higher flight metabolic rates. Flight behavior was more sensitive to decreasing oxygen levels than flight metabolic rate. The oxygen sensitivity of flight metabolic rates and behaviors were not correlated with body size, indicating that larger insects are able to maintain an oxygen supply-to-demand balance even during flight."},{"title":"Paracellular nutrient absorption is higher in bats than rodents: integrating from intact animals to the molecular level","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3483","abstract":"Flying vertebrates have been hypothesized to rely heavily on paracellular absorption of nutrients to compensate for having smaller intestines than non-flyers. We tested this hypothesis in an insectivorous bat (Myotis lucifugus) and two insect-eating rodents (Onychomys leucogaster and Peromyscus leucopus). In intact animals, the fractional absorption of orally dosed l-arabinose (Mr 150) was 82% in M. lucifugus, which was more than twice that of the rodents. Absorption of creatinine (Mr 113) was greater than 50% for all species and did not differ between M. lucifugus and the rodents. We also conducted intestinal luminal perfusions on anesthetized animals. Absorption of l-arabinose per nominal surface area in M. lucifugus was nearly double that of the rodents, while absorption of creatinine was not different among species. Using an everted sleeve preparation, we demonstrated that high concentrations of l-arabinose and creatinine did not inhibit their own uptake, validating their use as passive, paracellular probes. Histological measurements indicated that M. lucifugus has more cells, and presumably more tight junctions, per nominal surface area than P. leucopus. This seems unlikely to explain entirely the higher absorption of l-arabinose in M. lucifugus during perfusions, because l-arabinose absorption normalized to the number of enterocytes was still double that of P. leucopus. As an alternative, we investigated tight junction gene expression. M. lucifugus had higher expression of claudin-1 and claudin-15, and lower expression of claudin-2 relative to P. leucopus. Expression of claudin-7 and occludin did not differ among species. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that bats have evolved higher paracellular nutrient absorption than non-flying animals, and that this phenomenon might be driven by both histological characteristics and differences in tight junction gene expression."},{"title":"Dual silencing of long and short Amblyomma americanum acidic chitinase forms weakens the tick cement cone stability","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3493","abstract":"This study demonstrates that Amblyomma americanum (Aam) constitutively and ubiquitously expresses the long (L) and short (S) putative acidic chitinases (Ach) that are distinguished by a 210 base pair (bp) deletion in AamAch-S. Full-length AamAch-L and AamAch-S cDNA are 1959 and 1718 bp long, containing 1332 and 1104 bp open reading frames that code for 443 and 367 amino acid residues proteins with the former predicted to be extracellular and the latter intracellular. Both AamAch-L and AamAch-S mRNA are expressed in multiple organs as revealed by qualitative RT-PCR analysis. Furthermore, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that AamAch-L mRNA was downregulated in the mid-gut, but was unchanged in the salivary gland and in other organs in response to feeding. Of significant interest, AamAch-L and/or AamAch-S functions are probably associated with formation and/or maintenance of stability of A. americanum tick cement cone. Dual RNA interference silencing of AamAch-L and/or AamAch-S mRNA caused ticks to loosely attach onto host skin as suggested by bleeding around tick mouthparts and ticks detaching off host skin with a light touch. AamAch-L may apparently encode an inactive chitinase as indicated by Pichia pastoris-expressed recombinant AamAch-L failing to hydrolyse chitinase substrates. Unpublished related work in our laboratory, and published work by others that found AamAch-L in tick saliva, suggest that native AamAch-L is a non-specific immunoglobulin binding tick saliva protein in that rAamAch-L non-specifically bound rabbit, bovine and chicken non-immune sera.

Whereas it is well known in insects, this mechanism is much less studied in arachnids, except spiders. Soil-dwelling harvestmen (Opiliones, Nemastomatidae) bear drumstick-like glandular hairs (clavate setae) at their pedipalps, which were previously hypothesized to be sticky and used in prey capture. However, clear evidence for this was lacking to date. Using high-speed videography, we found that the harvestman Mitostoma chrysomelas was able to capture fast-moving springtails (Collembola) just by a slight touch of the pedipalp. Adhesion of single clavate setae increased proportionally with pull-off velocity, from 1 μN at 1 μm s−1 up to 7 μN at 1 mm s−1, which corresponds to the typical weight of springtails. Stretched glue droplets exhibited characteristics of a viscoelastic fluid forming beads-on-a-string morphology over time, similar to spider capture threads and the sticky tentacles of carnivorous plants. These analogies indicate that viscoelasticity is a highly efficient mechanism for prey capture, as it holds stronger the faster the struggling prey moves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy of snap-frozen harvestmen with glued springtails revealed that the gluey secretions have a high affinity to wet the microstructured cuticle of collembolans, which was previously reported to be barely wettable for both polar and non-polar liquids. Glue droplets can be contaminated with the detached scaly setae of collembolans, which may represent a counter-adaptation against entrapment by the glue, similar to the scaly surfaces of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera (Insecta) facilitating escape from spider webs."},{"title":"Early deactivation of slower muscle fibres at high movement frequencies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3528","abstract":"Animals produce rapid movements using fast cyclical muscle contractions. These types of movements are better suited to faster muscle fibres within muscles of mixed fibre types as they can shorten at faster velocities and achieve higher activation–deactivation rates than their slower counterparts. Preferential recruitment of faster muscle fibres has previously been shown during high velocity contractions. Additionally, muscle deactivation takes longer than activation and therefore may pose a limitation to fast cyclical contractions. It has been speculated that slower fibres may be deactivated before faster fibres to accommodate their longer deactivation time. This study aimed to test whether shifts in muscle fibre recruitment occur with derecruitment of slow fibres before faster fibres at high cycle frequencies. Electromyographic (EMG) signals were collected from the medial gastrocnemius at an extreme range of cycle frequencies and workloads. Wavelets were used to resolve the EMG signals into time and frequency space and the primary sources of variability within the EMG frequency spectra were identified through principal component analysis. Early derecruitment of slower fibres was evident at the end of muscle excitation at higher cycle frequencies, as determined by reduced low-frequency EMG content, and additional slower fibre recruitment was present at the highest cycle frequency. The duration of muscle excitation reached a minimum of about 150 ms and did not change for the three highest cycle frequencies, suggesting a duration limit for the medial gastrocnemius. This study provides further evidence of modifications of muscle fibre recruitment strategies to meet the mechanical demands of movement."},{"title":"Effects of natural and synthetic alarm pheromone and individual pheromone components on foraging behavior of the giant Asian honey bee, Apis dorsata","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3512","abstract":"Social pollinators such as honey bees face attacks from predators not only at the nest, but also during foraging. Pollinating honey bees can therefore release alarm pheromones that deter conspecifics from visiting dangerous inflorescences. However, the effect of alarm pheromone and its chemical components upon bee avoidance of dangerous food sources remains unclear. We tested the responses of giant honey bee foragers, Apis dorsata, presented with alarm pheromone at a floral array. Foragers investigated the inflorescence with natural alarm pheromone, but 3.3-fold more foragers preferred to land on the ‘safe’ inflorescence without alarm pheromone. Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis, we identified eight chemical components in the alarm pheromone, of which three components (1-octanol, decanal and gamma-octanoic lactone) have not previously been reported in this species. We bioassayed six major compounds and found that a synthetic mixture of these compounds elicited behaviors statistically indistinguishable from responses to natural alarm pheromone. By testing each compound separately, we show that gamma-octanoic lactone, isopentyl acetate and (E)-2-decen-1-yl acetate are active compounds that elicit significant alarm responses. Gamma-octanoic lactone elicited the strongest response to a single compound and has not been previously reported in honey bee alarm pheromone. Isopentyl acetate is widely found in the alarm pheromones of sympatric Asian honey bee species, and thus alarmed A. dorsata foragers may produce information useful for conspecifics and heterospecifics, thereby broadening the effects of alarm information on plant pollination."},{"title":"Joint-level mechanics of the walk-to-run transition in humans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3519","abstract":"Two commonly proposed mechanical explanations for the walk-to-run transition (WRT) include the prevention of muscular over-exertion (effort) and the minimization of peak musculoskeletal loads and thus injury risk. The purpose of this study was to address these hypotheses at a joint level by analysing the effect of speed on discrete lower-limb joint kinetic parameters in humans across a wide range of walking and running speeds including walking above and running below the WRT speed. Joint work, peak instantaneous joint power, and peak joint moments in the sagittal and frontal plane of the ankle, knee and hip from eight participants were collected for 10 walking speeds (30–120% of their WRT) and 10 running speeds (80–170% of their WRT) on a force plate instrumented treadmill. Of the parameters analysed, three satisfied our statistical criteria of the ‘effort-load’ hypothesis of the WRT. Mechanical parameters that provide an acute signal (peak moment and peak power) were more strongly associated with the gait transition than parameters that reflect the mechanical function across a portion of the stride. We found that both the ankle (peak instantaneous joint power during swing) and hip mechanics (peak instantaneous joint power and peak joint moments in stance) can influence the transition from walking to running in human locomotion and may represent a cascade of mechanical events beginning at the ankle and leading to an unfavourable compensation at the hip. Both the ankle and hip mechanisms may contribute to gait transition by lowering the muscular effort of running compared with walking at the WRT speed. Although few of the examined joint variables satisfied our hypothesis of the WRT, most showed a general marked increase when switching from walking to running across all speeds where both walking and running are possible, highlighting the fundamental differences in the mechanics of walking and running. While not eliciting the WRT per se, these variables may initiate the transition between stable walking and running patterns. Those variables that were invariant of gait were predominantly found in the swing phase."},{"title":"Opsin expression, physiological characterization and identification of photoreceptor cells in the dorsal rim area and main retina of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3557","abstract":"For compass orientation many insects rely on the pattern of sky polarization, but some species also exploit the sky chromatic contrast. Desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, detect polarized light through a specialized dorsal rim area (DRA) in their compound eye. To better understand retinal mechanisms underlying visual navigation, we compared opsin expression, spectral and polarization sensitivities and response–stimulus intensity functions in the DRA and main retina of the locust. In addition to previously characterized opsins of long-wavelength-absorbing (Lo1) and blue-absorbing visual pigments (Lo2), we identified an opsin of an ultraviolet-absorbing visual pigment (LoUV). DRA photoreceptors exclusively expressed Lo2, had peak spectral sensitivities at 441 nm and showed high polarization sensitivity (PS 1.3–31.7). In contrast, ommatidia in the main eye co-expressed Lo1 and Lo2 in five photoreceptors, expressed Lo1 in two proximal photoreceptors, and Lo2 or LoUV in one distal photoreceptor. Correspondingly, we found broadband blue- and green-peaking spectral sensitivities in the main eye and one narrowly tuned UV peaking receptor. Polarization sensitivity in the main retina was low (PS 1.3–3.8). V–log I functions in the DRA were steeper than in the main retina, supporting a role in polarization vision. Desert locusts occur as two morphs, a day-active gregarious and a night-active solitarious form. In solitarious locusts, sensitivities in the main retina were generally shifted to longer wavelengths, particularly in ventral eye regions, supporting a nocturnal lifestyle at low light levels. The data support the role of the DRA in polarization vision and suggest trichromatic colour vision in the desert locust."},{"title":"Effects of within-generation thermal history on the flight performance of Ceratitis capitata: colder is better","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3545","abstract":"The influence of thermal history on temperature-dependent flight performance was investigated in an invasive agricultural pest insect, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae). Flies were exposed to one of four developmental acclimation temperatures (Tacc: 15, 20, 25, 30°C) during their pupal stage and tested at these temperatures (Ttest) as adults using a full-factorial study design. Major factors influencing flight performance included sex, body mass, Ttest and the interaction between Ttest and Tacc. Successful flight performance increased with increasing Ttest across all acclimation groups (from 10% at 15°C to 77% at 30°C). Although Tacc did not affect flight performance independently, it did have a significant interaction effect with Ttest. Multiple comparisons showed that flies which had been acclimated to 15°C and 20°C performed better than those acclimated to 25°C and 30°C when tested at cold temperatures, but warm-acclimated flies did not outperform cold-acclimated flies at warmer temperatures. This provides partial support for the ‘colder is better’ hypothesis. To explain these results, several flight-related traits were examined to determine whether Tacc influenced flight performance as a consequence of changes in body or wing morphology, whole-animal metabolic rate or cytochrome c oxidase enzyme activity. Although significant effects of Tacc could be detected in several of the traits examined, with an emphasis on sex-related differences, increased flight performance could not be explained solely on the basis of changes in any of these traits. Overall, these results are important for understanding dispersal physiology despite the fact that the mechanisms of acclimation-related changes in flight performance remain unresolved."},{"title":"The stimuli evoking the aerial-righting posture of falling pea aphids","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3504","abstract":"Some wingless insects possess aerial righting reflexes, suggesting that adaptation for controlling body orientation while falling through air could have preceded flight. When threatened by natural enemies, wingless pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) may drop off their host plant and assume a stereotypic posture that rotates them in midair to land on their feet. The sensory information triggering aphids to assume this posture has so far been unknown. We subjected aphids to a series of tests, isolating the sensory cues experienced during free-fall. Falling aphids assumed the righting posture and landed upright irrespective of whether the experiments were carried out in the light or in complete darkness. Detachment of the tarsi from the substrate triggered the aphids to assume the posture rapidly, but only for a brief period. Rotation (mainly roll and yaw) of the body in air, in the light, caused aphids to assume the posture and remain in it throughout rotation. In contrast, aphids rotated in the dark did not respond. Acceleration associated with falling or airflow over the body per se did not trigger the posture. However, sensing motion relative to air heightened the aphids' responsiveness to rotation in the light. These results suggest that the righting posture of aphids is triggered by a tarsal reflex, but, once the aphid is airborne, vision and a sense of motion relative to air can augment the response. Hence, aerial righting in a wingless insect could have emerged as a basic tarsal response and developed further to include secondary sensory cues typical of falling."},{"title":"High paracellular nutrient absorption in intact bats is associated with high paracellular permeability in perfused intestinal segments","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3311","abstract":"Water-soluble nutrients are absorbed by the small intestine via transcellular and paracellular mechanisms. Based on a few previous studies, the capacity for paracellular nutrient absorption seems greater in flying mammals than in nonflying mammals, but there has been little investigation of the mechanisms driving this difference. Therefore, we studied three species each of bats (Artibeus lituratus, Sturnira lilium and Carollia perspicillata) and nonflying mammals (Akodon montensis, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus). Using standard pharmacokinetic techniques in intact animals, we confirmed the greater paracellular nutrient absorption in the fliers, comparing one species in each group. Then we conducted in situ intestinal perfusions on individuals of all species. In both approaches, we measured the absorption of 3OMD-glucose, a nonmetabolizable glucose analog absorbed both paracellularly and transcellularly, as well as l-arabinose, which has no mediated transport. Fractional absorption of l-arabinose was three times higher in the bat (S. lilium: 1.2±0.24) than in the rodent (A. montensis: 0.35±0.04), whereas fractional absorption of 3OMD-glucose was complete in both species (1.46±0.4 and 0.97±0.12, respectively). In agreement, bats exhibited two to 12 times higher l-arabinose clearance per square centimeter nominal surface area than rodents in intestinal perfusions. Using l-arabinose, we estimated that the contribution of the paracellular pathway to total glucose absorption was higher in all three bats (109–137%) than in the rodents (13–39%). These findings contribute to an emerging picture that reliance on the paracellular pathway for nutrient absorption is much greater in bats relative to nonflying mammals and that this difference is driven by differences in intestinal permeability to nutrient-sized molecules."},{"title":"Cardiac responses to hypercapnia in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio): the links between CO2 chemoreception, catecholamines and carbonic anhydrase","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3569","abstract":"The ontogeny of carbon dioxide (CO2) sensing in zebrafish (Danio rerio) has not been examined. In this study, CO2-mediated increases in heart rate were used to gauge the capacity of zebrafish larvae to sense CO2. CO2 is thought to be detected via neuroepithelial cells (NECs), which are homologous to mammalian carotid body glomus cells. Larvae at 5 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) exhibited tachycardia when exposed for 30 min to 0.75% CO2 (~5.63 mmHg); at 7 d.p.f., tachycardia was elicited by 0.5% CO2 (~3.75 mmHg). Based on pharmacological evidence using β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) antagonists, and confirmed by β1-AR translational gene knockdown using morpholinos, the reflex tachycardia accompanying hypercapnia was probably mediated by the interaction of catecholamines with cardiac β1 receptors. Because the cardiac response to hypercapnia was abolished by the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium, it is probable that the reflex cardio-acceleration was mediated by catecholamines derived from sympathetic adrenergic neurons. Owing to its likely role in facilitating intracellular acidification during exposure to hypercapnia, it was hypothesized that carbonic anhydrase (CA) is involved in CO2 sensing, and that inhibition of CA activity would blunt the downstream responses. Indeed, the cardiac response to hypercapnia (0.75% CO2) was reduced in fish at 5 d.p.f. exposed to acetazolamide, a CA inhibitor, and in fish experiencing zCAc (CA2-like a) knockdown. Successful knockdown of zCAc was confirmed by CA activity measurements, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Co-injection of embryos with zCAc morpholino and mRNA modified at the morpholino binding site restored normal levels of CA activity and protein levels, and restored (rescued) the usual cardiac responses to hypercapnia. These data, combined with the finding that zCAc is expressed in NECs located on the skin, suggest that the afferent limb of the CO2-induced cardiac reflex in zebrafish larvae is initiated by coetaneous CO2-sensing neuroepithelial cells."},{"title":"Mitochondrial uncoupling as a regulator of life-history trajectories in birds: an experimental study in the zebra finch","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3579","abstract":"Mitochondria have a fundamental role in the transduction of energy from food into ATP. The coupling between food oxidation and ATP production is never perfect, but may nevertheless be of evolutionary significance. The ‘uncoupling to survive’ hypothesis suggests that ‘mild’ mitochondrial uncoupling evolved as a protective mechanism against the excessive production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because resource allocation and ROS production are thought to shape animal life histories, alternative life-history trajectories might be driven by individual variation in the degree of mitochondrial uncoupling. We tested this hypothesis in a small bird species, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), by treating adults with the artificial mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) over a 32-month period. In agreement with our expectations, the uncoupling treatment increased metabolic rate. However, we found no evidence that treated birds enjoyed lower oxidative stress levels or greater survival rates, in contrast to previous results in other taxa. In vitro experiments revealed lower sensitivity of ROS production to DNP in mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscles of zebra finch than mouse. In addition, we found significant reductions in the number of eggs laid and in the inflammatory immune response in treated birds. Altogether, our data suggest that the ‘uncoupling to survive’ hypothesis may not be applicable for zebra finches, presumably because of lower effects of mitochondrial uncoupling on mitochondrial ROS production in birds than in mammals. Nevertheless, mitochondrial uncoupling appeared to be a potential life-history regulator of traits such as fecundity and immunity at adulthood, even with food supplied ad libitum."},{"title":"Fine-tuned echolocation and capture-flight of Myotis capaccinii when facing different-sized insect and fish prey","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3318","abstract":"Formerly thought to be a strictly insectivorous trawling bat, recent studies have shown that Myotis capaccinii also preys on fish. To determine whether differences exist in bat flight behaviour, prey handling and echolocation characteristics when catching fish and insects of different size, we conducted a field experiment focused on the last stage of prey capture. We used synchronized video and ultrasound recordings to measure several flight and dip features as well as echolocation characteristics, focusing on terminal buzz phase I, characterized by a call rate exceeding 100 Hz, and buzz phase II, characterized by a drop in the fundamental well below 20 kHz and a repetition rate exceeding 150 Hz. When capturing insects, bats used both parts of the terminal phase to the same extent, and performed short and superficial drags on the water surface. In contrast, when preying on fish, buzz I was longer and buzz II shorter, and the bats made longer and deeper dips. These variations suggest that lengthening buzz I and shortening buzz II when fishing is beneficial, probably because buzz I gives better discrimination ability and the broader sonar beam provided by buzz II is useless when no evasive flight of the prey is expected. Additionally, bats continued emitting calls beyond the theoretical signal-overlap zone, suggesting that they might obtain information even when they have surpassed that threshold, at least initially. This study shows that M. capaccinii can regulate the temporal components of its feeding buzzes and modify prey capture technique according to the target."},{"title":"Nesting behaviour influences species-specific gas exchange across avian eggshells","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3326","abstract":"Carefully controlled gas exchange across the eggshell is essential for the development of the avian embryo. Water vapour conductance (GH2O) across the shell, typically measured as mass loss during incubation, has been demonstrated to optimally ensure the healthy development of the embryo while avoiding desiccation. Accordingly, eggs exposed to sub-optimal gas exchange have reduced hatching success. We tested the association between eggshell GH2O and putative life-history correlates of adult birds, ecological nest parameters and physical characteristics of the egg itself to investigate how variation in GH2O has evolved to maintain optimal water loss across a diverse set of nest environments. We measured gas exchange through eggshell fragments in 151 British breeding bird species and fitted phylogenetically controlled, general linear models to test the relationship between GH2O and potential predictor parameters of each species. Of our 17 life-history traits, only two were retained in the final model: wet-incubating parent and nest type. Eggs of species where the parent habitually returned to the nest with wet plumage had significantly higher GH2O than those of parents that returned to the nest with dry plumage. Eggs of species nesting in ground burrows, cliffs and arboreal cups had significantly higher GH2O than those of species nesting on the ground in open nests or cups, in tree cavities and in shallow arboreal nests. Phylogenetic signal (measured as Pagel's λ) was intermediate in magnitude, suggesting that differences observed in the GH2O are dependent upon a combination of shared ancestry and species-specific life history and ecological traits. Although these data are correlational by nature, they are consistent with the hypothesis that parents constrained to return to the nest with wet plumage will increase the humidity of the nest environment, and the eggs of these species have evolved a higher GH2O to overcome this constraint and still achieve optimal water loss during incubation. We also suggest that eggs laid in cup nests and burrows may require a higher GH2O to overcome the increased humidity as a result from the confined nest microclimate lacking air movements through the nest. Taken together, these comparative data imply that species-specific levels of gas exchange across avian eggshells are variable and evolve in response to ecological and physical variation resulting from parental and nesting behaviours."},{"title":"Physiological vagility and its relationship to dispersal and neutral genetic heterogeneity in vertebrates","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3356","abstract":"Vagility is the inherent power of movement by individuals. Vagility and the available duration of movement determine the dispersal distance individuals can move to interbreed, which affects the fine-scale genetic structure of vertebrate populations. Vagility and variation in population genetic structure are normally explained by geographic variation and not by the inherent power of movement by individuals. We present a new, quantitative definition for physiological vagility that incorporates aerobic capacity, body size, body temperature and the metabolic cost of transport, variables that are independent of the physical environment. Physiological vagility is the speed at which an animal can move sustainably based on these parameters. This meta-analysis tests whether this definition of physiological vagility correlates with empirical data for maximal dispersal distances and measured microsatellite genetic differentiation with distance {[FST/[1−FST)]/ln distance} for amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals utilizing three locomotor modes (running, flying, swimming). Maximal dispersal distance and physiological vagility increased with body mass for amphibians, reptiles and mammals utilizing terrestrial movement. The relative slopes of these relationships indicate that larger individuals require longer movement durations to achieve maximal dispersal distances. Both physiological vagility and maximal dispersal distance were independent of body mass for flying vertebrates. Genetic differentiation with distance was greatest for terrestrial locomotion, with amphibians showing the greatest mean and variance in differentiation. Flying birds, flying mammals and swimming marine mammals showed the least differentiation. Mean physiological vagility of different groups (class and locomotor mode) accounted for 98% of the mean variation in genetic differentiation with distance in each group. Genetic differentiation with distance was not related to body mass. The physiological capacity for movement (physiological vagility) quantitatively predicts genetic isolation by distance in the vertebrates examined."},{"title":"Niche-specific cognitive strategies: object memory interferes with spatial memory in the predatory bat Myotis nattereri","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3293","abstract":"Related species with different diets are predicted to rely on different cognitive strategies: those best suited for locating available and appropriate foods. Here we tested two predictions of the niche-specific cognitive strategies hypothesis in bats, which suggests that predatory species should rely more on object memory than on spatial memory for finding food and that the opposite is true of frugivorous and nectivorous species. Specifically, we predicted that: (1) predatory bats would readily learn to associate shapes with palatable prey and (2) once bats had made such associations, these would interfere with their subsequent learning of a spatial memory task. We trained free-flying Myotis nattereri to approach palatable and unpalatable insect prey suspended below polystyrene objects. Experimentally naïve bats learned to associate different objects with palatable and unpalatable prey but performed no better than chance in a subsequent spatial memory experiment. Because experimental sequence was predicted to be of consequence, we introduced a second group of bats first to the spatial memory experiment. These bats learned to associate prey position with palatability. Control trials indicated that bats made their decisions based on information acquired through echolocation. Previous studies have shown that bat species that eat mainly nectar and fruit rely heavily on spatial memory, reflecting the relative consistency of distribution of fruit and nectar compared with insects. Our results support the niche-specific cognitive strategies hypothesis and suggest that for gleaning and clutter-resistant aerial hawking bats, learning to associate shape with food interferes with subsequent spatial memory learning."},{"title":"K+ absorption by locust gut and inhibition of ileal K+ and water transport by FGLamide allatostatins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3377","abstract":"The scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET) was utilized for the first time in Locusta migratoria to characterize K+ transport along the digestive tract and to determine the effect of two locust FGLamide allatostatins (FGLa/ASTs) on K+ transport: a previously sequenced FGLa/AST from Schistocerca gregaria (Scg-AST-6; ARPYSFGL-NH2) and a newly sequenced FGLa/AST from L. migratoria (Locmi-FGLa/AST-2; LPVYNFGL-NH2). Regional differences in K+ fluxes along the gut were evident, where K+ efflux in vitro (or absorption into the hemolymph in vivo) was greatest at the anterior ileum, and lowest at the colon. Ileal K+ efflux was inhibited by both Scg-AST-6 and Locmi-FGLa/AST-2, with maximal inhibition at 10−10 and 10−11 mol l−1, respectively. Both FGLa/ASTs also inhibited cAMP-stimulated K+ efflux from the ileum. Locmi-FGLa/AST-2 also inhibited efflux of water across the ileum. Locusts are terrestrial insects living in dry climates, risking desiccation and making water conservation a necessity. The results suggest that FGLa/ASTs may be acting as diuretics by increasing K+ excretion and therefore increasing water excretion. Thus it is likely that FGLa/ASTs are involved in the control of hemolymph water and ion levels during feeding and digestion, to help the locust deal with the excess K+ load (and subsequently fluid) when the meal is processed."},{"title":"The search space of the rat during whisking behavior","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3365","abstract":"Rodents move their vibrissae rhythmically to tactually explore their surroundings. We used a three-dimensional model of the vibrissal array to quantify the rat's ‘search space’ during whisking. Search space was quantified either as the volume encompassed by the array or as the surface formed by the vibrissal tips. At rest, the average position of the vibrissal tips lies near the rat's mouth, and the tips are all approximately equidistant from the midpoint between the rat's eyes, suggesting spatial registration with the visual system. The intrinsic curvature of the vibrissae greatly increases the volume encompassed by the array, and during a protraction, roll and elevation changes have strong effects on the trajectories of the vibrissal tips. The size of the rat's search space – as measured either by the volume of the array or by the surface area formed by the vibrissal tips – was surprisingly unaffected by protraction angle. In contrast, search space was strongly correlated with the ‘spread’ of the array, defined as the angle between rostral and caudal-most whiskers. We draw two conclusions: first, that with some caveats, spread can be used as a proxy for changes in search space, and second, in order to change its sensing resolution, the rat must differentially control rostral and caudal vibrissae. Finally, we show that behavioral data can be incorporated into the three-dimensional model to visualize changes in vibrissal search space and sensing resolution during natural exploratory whisking."},{"title":"Physiological mechanisms underlying individual variation in tolerance of food deprivation in juvenile European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3283","abstract":"Although food deprivation is a major ecological pressure in fishes, there is wide individual variation in tolerance of fasting, whose mechanistic bases are poorly understood. Two thousand individually tagged juvenile European sea bass were submitted to two ‘fasting/feeding’ cycles each comprising 3 weeks of food deprivation followed by 3 weeks of ad libitum feeding at 25°C. Rates of mass loss during the two fasting periods were averaged for each individual to calculate a population mean. Extreme fasting tolerant (FT) and sensitive (FS) phenotypes were identified that were at least one and a half standard deviations, on opposing sides, from this mean. Respirometry was used to investigate two main hypotheses: (1) tolerance of food deprivation reflects lower mass-corrected routine metabolic rate (RMR) in FT phenotypes when fasting, and (2) tolerance reflects differences in substrate utilisation; FT phenotypes use relatively less proteins as metabolic fuels during fasting, measured as their ammonia quotient (AQ), the simultaneous ratio of ammonia excretion to RMR. There was no difference in mean RMR between FT and FS over 7 days fasting, being 6.70±0.24 mmol h−1 fish−1 (mean ± s.e.m., N=18) versus 6.76±0.22 mmol h−1 fish−1 (N=17), respectively, when corrected to a body mass of 130 g. For any given RMR, however, the FT lost mass at a significantly lower rate than FS, overall 7-day average being 0.72±0.05 versus 0.90±0.05 g day−1 fish−1, respectively (P<0.01, t-test). At 20 h after receiving a ration equivalent to 2% body mass as food pellets, ammonia excretion and simultaneous RMR were elevated and similar in FT and FS, with AQs of 0.105±0.009 and 0.089±0.007, respectively. At the end of the period of fasting, ammonia excretion and RMR had fallen in both phenotypes, but AQ was significantly lower in FT than FS, being 0.038±0.004 versus 0.061±0.005, respectively (P<0.001, t-test). There was a direct linear relationship between individual fasted AQ and rate of mass loss, with FT and FS individuals distributed at opposing lower and upper extremities, respectively. Thus the difference between the phenotypes in their tolerance of food deprivation did not depend upon their routine energy use when fasting. Rather, it depended upon their relative use of tissue proteins as metabolic fuels when fasting, which was significantly lower in FT phenotypes."},{"title":"Mechanical processing via passive dynamic properties of the cockroach antenna can facilitate control during rapid running","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3333","abstract":"The integration of information from dynamic sensory structures operating on a moving body is a challenge for locomoting animals and engineers seeking to design agile robots. As a tactile sensor is a physical linkage mediating mechanical interactions between body and environment, mechanical tuning of the sensor is critical for effective control. We determined the open-loop dynamics of a tactile sensor, specifically the antenna of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, an animal that escapes predators by using its antennae during rapid closed-loop tactilely mediated course control. Geometrical measurements and static bending experiments revealed an exponentially decreasing flexural stiffness (EI) from base to tip. Quasi-static experiments with a physical model support the hypothesis that a proximodistally decreasing EI can simplify control by increasing preview distance and allowing effective mapping to a putative control variable – body-to-wall distance – compared with an antenna with constant EI. We measured the free response at the tip of the antenna following step deflections and determined that the antenna rapidly damps large deflections: over 90% of the perturbation is rejected within the first cycle, corresponding to almost one stride period during high-speed running (~50 ms). An impulse-like perturbation near the tip revealed dynamics that were characteristic of an inelastic collision, keeping the antenna in contact with an object after impact. We contend that proximodistally decreasing stiffness, high damping and inelasticity simplify control during high-speed tactile tasks by increasing preview distance, providing a one-dimensional map between antennal bending and body-to-wall distance, and increasing the reliability of tactile information."},{"title":"Scavenging ROS dramatically increase NMDA receptor whole-cell currents in painted turtle cortical neurons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3346","abstract":"Oxygen deprivation triggers excitotoxic cell death in mammal neurons through excessive calcium loading via over-activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. This does not occur in the western painted turtle, which overwinters for months without oxygen. Neurological damage is avoided through anoxia-mediated decreases in NMDA and AMPA receptor currents that are dependent upon a modest rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) originating from mitochondria. Anoxia also blocks mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which is another potential signaling mechanism to regulate glutamate receptors. To assess the effects of decreased intracellular [ROS] on NMDA and AMPA receptor currents, we scavenged ROS with N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine (MPG) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Unlike anoxia, ROS scavengers increased NMDA receptor whole-cell currents by 100%, while hydrogen peroxide decreased currents. AMPA receptor currents and [Ca2+]i concentrations were unaffected by ROS manipulation. Because decreases in [ROS] increased NMDA receptor currents, we next asked whether mitochondrial Ca2+ release prevents receptor potentiation during anoxia. Normoxic activation of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (mKATP) channels with diazoxide decreased NMDA receptor currents and was unaffected by subsequent ROS scavenging. Diazoxide application following ROS scavenging did not rescue scavenger-mediated increases in NMDA receptor currents. Fluorescent measurement of [Ca2+]i and ROS levels demonstrated that [Ca2+]i increases before ROS decreases. We conclude that decreases in ROS concentration are not linked to anoxia-mediated decreases in NMDA/AMPA receptor currents but are rather associated with an increase in NMDA receptor currents that is prevented during anoxia by mitochondrial Ca2+ release."},{"title":"A context-dependent alarm signal in the ant Temnothorax rugatulus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3229","abstract":"Because collective cognition emerges from local signaling among group members, deciphering communication systems is crucial to understanding the underlying mechanisms. Alarm signals are widespread in the social insects and can elicit a variety of behavioral responses to danger, but the functional plasticity of these signals has not been well studied. Here we report an alarm pheromone in the ant Temnothorax rugatulus that elicits two different behaviors depending on context. When an ant was tethered inside an unfamiliar nest site and unable to move freely, she released a pheromone from her mandibular gland that signaled other ants to reject this nest as a potential new home, presumably to avoid potential danger. When the same pheromone was presented near the ants' home nest, they were instead attracted to it, presumably to respond to a threat to the colony. We used coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify candidate compounds from the mandibular gland and tested each one in a nest choice bioassay. We found that 2,5-dimethylpyrazine was sufficient to induce rejection of a marked new nest and also to attract ants when released at the home nest. This is the first detailed investigation of chemical communication in the leptothoracine ants. We discuss the possibility that this pheromone's deterrent function can improve an emigrating colony's nest site selection performance."},{"title":"Social regulation of cortisol receptor gene expression","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3221","abstract":"In many social species, individuals influence the reproductive capacity of conspecifics. In a well-studied African cichlid fish species, Astatotilapia burtoni, males are either dominant (D) and reproductively competent or non-dominant (ND) and reproductively suppressed as evidenced by reduced gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH1) release, regressed gonads, lower levels of androgens and elevated levels of cortisol. Here, we asked whether androgen and cortisol levels might regulate this reproductive suppression. Astatotilapia burtoni has four glucocorticoid receptors (GR1a, GR1b, GR2 and MR), encoded by three genes, and two androgen receptors (ARα and ARβ), encoded by two genes. We previously showed that ARα and ARβ are expressed in GnRH1 neurons in the preoptic area (POA), which regulates reproduction, and that the mRNA levels of these receptors are regulated by social status. Here, we show that GR1, GR2 and MR mRNAs are also expressed in GnRH1 neurons in the POA, revealing potential mechanisms for both androgens and cortisol to influence reproductive capacity. We measured AR, MR and GR mRNA expression levels in a microdissected region of the POA containing GnRH1 neurons, comparing D and ND males. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we found D males had higher mRNA levels of ARα, MR, total GR1a and GR2 in the POA compared with ND males. In contrast, ND males had significantly higher levels of GR1b mRNA, a receptor subtype with a reduced transcriptional response to cortisol. Through this novel regulation of receptor type, neurons in the POA of an ND male will be less affected by the higher levels of cortisol typical of low status, suggesting GR receptor type change as a potential adaptive mechanism to mediate high cortisol levels during social suppression."},{"title":"Gaze characteristics of freely walking blowflies Calliphora vicina in a goal-directed task","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3209","abstract":"In contrast to flying flies, walking flies experience relatively strong rotational gaze shifts, even during overall straight phases of locomotion. These gaze shifts are caused by the walking apparatus and modulated by the stride frequency. Accordingly, even during straight walking phases, the retinal image flow is composed of both translational and rotational optic flow, which might affect spatial vision, as well as fixation behavior. We addressed this issue for an orientation task where walking blowflies approached a black vertical bar. The visual stimulus was stationary, or either the bar or the background moved horizontally. The stride-coupled gaze shifts of flies walking toward the bar had similar amplitudes under all visual conditions tested. This finding indicates that these shifts are an inherent feature of walking, which are not even compensated during a visual goal fixation task. By contrast, approaching flies showed a frequent stop-and-go behavior that was affected by the stimulus conditions. As sustained image rotations may impair distance estimation during walking, we propose a hypothesis that explains how rotation-independent translatory image flow containing distance information can be determined. The algorithm proposed works without requiring differentiation at the behavioral level of the rotational and translational flow components. By contrast, disentangling both has been proposed to be necessary during flight. By comparing the retinal velocities of the edges of the goal, its rotational image motion component can be removed. Consequently, the expansion velocity of the goal and, thus, its proximity can be extracted, irrespective of distance-independent stride-coupled rotational image shifts."},{"title":"The elaborate plumage in peacocks is not such a drag","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3237","abstract":"One of the classic examples of an exaggerated sexually selected trait is the elaborate plumage that forms the train in male peafowl Pavo cristatus (peacock). Such ornaments are thought to reduce locomotor performance as a result of their weight and aerodynamic drag, but this cost is unknown. Here, the effect that the train has on take-off flight in peacocks was quantified as the sum of the rates of change of the potential and kinetic energies of the body (PCoM) in birds with trains and following the train's removal. There was no significant difference between PCoM in birds with and without a train. The train incurs drag during take-off; however, while this produces a twofold increase in parasite drag, parasite power only accounts for 0.1% of the total aerodynamic power. The train represented 6.9% of body weight and is expected to increase induced power. The absence of a detectable effect on take-off performance does not necessarily mean that there is no cost associated with possessing such ornate plumage; rather, it suggests that given the variation in take-off performance per se, the magnitude of any effect of the train has little meaningful functional relevance."},{"title":"Spatial co-ordination of foot contacts in unrestrained climbing insects","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3242","abstract":"Animals that live in a spatially complex environment such as the canopy of a tree, constantly need to find reliable foothold in three-dimensional (3D) space. In multi-legged animals, spatial co-ordination among legs is thought to improve efficiency of finding foothold by avoiding searching-movements in trailing legs. In stick insects, a ‘targeting mechanism’ has been described that guides foot-placement of hind- and middle legs according to the position of their leading ipsilateral leg. So far, this mechanism has been shown for standing and tethered walking animals on horizontal surfaces. Here, we investigate the efficiency of this mechanism in spatial limb co-ordination of unrestrained climbing animals. For this, we recorded whole-body kinematics of freely climbing stick insects and analysed foot placement in 3D space. We found that touch-down positions of adjacent legs were highly correlated in all three spatial dimensions, revealing 3D co-ordinate transfer among legs. Furthermore, targeting precision depended on the position of the leading leg. A second objective was to test the importance of sensory information transfer between legs. For this, we ablated a proprioceptive hair field signaling the levation of the leg. After ablation, the operated leg swung higher and performed unexpected searching movements. Furthermore, targeting of the ipsilateral trailing leg was less precise in anteroposterior and dorsoventral directions. Our results reveal that the targeting mechanism is used by unrestrained climbing stick insects in 3D space and that information from the trochanteral hair field is used in ipsilateral spatial co-ordination among legs."},{"title":"Female gray treefrogs, Hyla versicolor, are responsive to visual stimuli but unselective of stimulus characteristics","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3254","abstract":"The visual ecology of nocturnal anurans is poorly understood, but there is growing evidence that vision plays a role in important behaviors such as mate choice. While several recent studies have demonstrated that females are responsive to visual cues when selecting mates, the forces responsible for these preferences are unknown. We investigated the responsiveness of female gray treefrogs, Hyla versicolor, to video playbacks of calling conspecific males in which we varied attributes of the vocal sac, a conspicuous visual characteristic of calling males and a target of female choice in other species. Females responded surprisingly strongly to the video playbacks, but did so indiscriminately with respect to variation in vocal sac characteristics. We followed up on these results with a series of additional tests that examined female responses to abstract stimuli. Females continued to respond to such stimuli, leading us to conclude that their behavior was related to a generalized phototactic response. Because of this, we were unable to make conclusions regarding female preferences for vocal sac characteristics. Nonetheless, our results are significant in two respects. First, we illustrate that despite much effort into improving video playback methodologies, challenges remain, and we offer our experimental design as a method to ensure that appropriate conclusions can be drawn from such studies. Second, we argue that the female phototactic response has potentially significant behavioral implications and in general the consequences of anuran visual preferences deserve further investigation."},{"title":"Hiding opaque eyes in transparent organisms: a potential role for larval eyeshine in stomatopod crustaceans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3263","abstract":"Opaque screening pigments are a fundamental requisite for preserving resolution in image-forming eyes. Possession of any type of image-forming eye in a transparent, pelagic animal will thus undermine the ability of that animal to be invisible in the water column. Transparent, pelagic animals must therefore deal with the trade-off between the ability to see and the ability of other animals to see them. Stomatopod larvae, like many transparent crustaceans, possess specialized optics in their compound eyes that minimize the volume of the opaque retina. Though the volumes of these retinas are reduced, their opacity remains conspicuous to an observer. The light reflected from structures overlying the retinas of stomatopod crustacean larval eyes, referred to here as eyeshine, is hypothesized to further reduce the visibility of opaque retinas. Blue or green wavelengths of light are most strongly reflected in stomatopod larval eyeshine, suggesting a putative spectral matching to the light environment against which the larval eyes are viewed. We tested the efficacy of stomatopod crustacean larval eyeshine as an ocular camouflaging mechanism by photographing larvae in their natural light environment and analysing the contrast of eyes with the background light. To test for spectral matching between stomatopod larval eyeshine and the background light environment, we characterized the spectrum of eyeshine and calculated its performance using radiometric measurements collected at the time of each photographic series. These results are the first to demonstrate an operative mirror camouflage matched in both spectrum and radiance to the pelagic background light environment."},{"title":"Is warmer better? Decreased oxidative damage in notothenioid fish after long-term acclimation to multiple stressors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3301","abstract":"Antarctic fish of the suborder Notothenioidei have evolved several unique adaptations to deal with subzero temperatures. However, these adaptations may come with physiological trade-offs, such as an increased susceptibility to oxidative damage. As such, the expected environmental perturbations brought on by global climate change have the potential to significantly increase the level of oxidative stress and cellular damage in these endemic fish. Previous single stressor studies of the notothenioids have shown they possess the capacity to acclimate to increased temperatures, but the cellular-level effects remain largely unknown. Additionally, there is little information on the ability of Antarctic fish to respond to ecologically relevant environmental changes where multiple variables change concomitantly. We have examined the potential synergistic effects that increased temperature and ṖCO2 have on the level of protein damage in Trematomus bernacchii, Pagothenia borchgrevinki and Trematomus newnesi, and combined these measurements with changes in total enzymatic activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in order to gauge tissue-specific changes in antioxidant capacity. Our findings indicate that total SOD and CAT activity levels displayed only small changes across treatments and tissues. Short-term acclimation to decreased seawater pH and increased temperature resulted in significant increases in oxidative damage. Surprisingly, despite no significant change in antioxidant capacity, cellular damage returned to near-basal levels, and significantly decreased in T. bernacchii, after long-term acclimation. Overall, these data suggest that notothenioid fish currently maintain the antioxidant capacity necessary to offset predicted future ocean conditions, but it remains unclear whether this capacity comes with physiological trade-offs."},{"title":"Exercising for food: bringing the laboratory closer to nature","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/18/3274","abstract":"Traditionally, exercise physiology experiments have borne little resemblance to how animals express physical activity in the wild. In this experiment, 15 adult male rats were divided into three equal-sized groups: exercise contingent (CON), non-exercise contingent (NON) and sedentary (SED). The CON group was placed in a cage with a running wheel, where the acquisition of food was contingent upon the distance required to run. Every 3 days the distance required to run to maintain food intake at free feeding levels was increased by 90% in comparison to the previous 3 days. The NON group was housed identically to the CON group, but food acquisition was not dependent upon running in the wheel. Finally, the SED group was kept in small cages with no opportunity to perform exercise. A two-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to determine significant differences in responses between the experimental phases and treatment groups, and ANCOVA was used to analyse growth and tissue mass variables with body length and body mass used separately as covariates. A post hoc Tukey's test was used to indicate significant differences. A Pearson's correlation was used to test the relationship between the distance travelled by the animal and the distance/food ratio. The level of significance was set at P<0.05 for all tests. The CON group showed the hypothesized correlation between distance required to run to obtain food and the mean distance travelled (P<0.001), during 45 days in the contingency phase. This group showed a decrease in body mass, rather than an increase as shown by NON and SED groups. The CON group had a significantly lower body temperature (P<0.05) and adiposity (P<0.05) when compared with the other two groups for the same body size. The present experimental model based on animals choosing the characteristics of their physical exercise to acquire food (i.e. distance travelled, speed and duration) clearly induced physiological effects (body characteristics and internal temperature), which are useful for investigating relevant topics in exercise physiology such as the link between exercise, food and body mass."},{"title":"Encoding properties of the mechanosensory neurons in the Johnston's organ of the hawk moth, Manduca sexta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3045","abstract":"Antennal mechanosensors play a key role in control and stability of insect flight. In addition to the well-established role of antennae as airflow detectors, recent studies have indicated that the sensing of antennal vibrations by Johnston's organs also provides a mechanosensory feedback relevant for flight stabilization. However, few studies have addressed how the individual units, or scolopidia, of the Johnston's organs encode these antennal vibrations and communicate it to the brain. Here, we characterize the encoding properties of individual scolopidia from the Johnston's organs in the hawk moth, Manduca sexta, through intracellular neurophysiological recordings from axons of the scolopidial neurons. We stimulated the flagellum–pedicel joint using a custom setup that delivered mechanical stimuli of various (step, sinusoidal, frequency and amplitude sweeps) waveforms. Single units of the Johnston's organs typically displayed phaso-tonic responses to step stimuli with short (3–5 ms) latencies. Their phase-locked response to sinusoidal stimuli in the 0.1–100 Hz frequency range showed high fidelity (vector strengths>0.9). The neurons were able to encode different phases of the stimulus motion and were also extremely sensitive to small amplitude (<0.05 deg) deflections with some indication of directional tuning. In many cases, the firing frequency of the neurons varied linearly as a function of the stimulus frequency at wingbeat and double wingbeat frequencies, which may be relevant to their role in flight stabilization. Iontophoretic fills of these neurons with fluorescent dyes showed that they all projected in the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC) area of the brain. Taken together, these results showcase the speed and high sensitivity of scolopidia of the Johnston's organs, and hence their ability to encode fine antennal vibrations."},{"title":"Influence of substrate orientation on feeding kinematics and performance of algae-grazing Lake Malawi cichlid fishes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3057","abstract":"Lake Malawi cichlids have been studied extensively in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms underlying their adaptive radiation. Both habitat partitioning and trophic specialization have been suggested to be critical ecological axes underlying the exceptional diversification of these fishes, but the mechanisms facilitating this divergence are often unclear. For instance, in the rock-dwelling mbuna of Lake Malawi, coexistence is likely tightly linked to how and where species feed on the algae coating all the surfaces of the rocky reefs they exclusively inhabit. Yet, although mbuna species often preferentially graze from particular substrate orientations, we understand very little about how substrate orientation influences feeding kinematics or feeding rates in any group of organisms. Therefore, for three species of mbuna, we quantified feeding kinematics and inferred the rates that algae could be ingested on substrates that mimicked the top, side and bottom of the algae-covered boulders these species utilize in Lake Malawi. A number of differences in feeding kinematics were found among species, and several of the kinematic variables were found to differ even within species when the fish grazed from different surface orientations. However, despite their preferences for particular microhabitats, we found no evidence for clear trade-offs in the rates that the three species were inferred to be able to obtain algae from different substrate orientations. Nevertheless, our results indicate microhabitat divergence linked to differences in feeding kinematics could have played a role in the origin and maintenance of the vast diversity of co-occurring Lake Malawi mbuna species."},{"title":"Adult somatic progenitor cells and hematopoiesis in oysters","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3067","abstract":"Long-lived animals show a non-observable age-related decline in immune defense, which is provided by blood cells that derive from self-renewing stem cells. The oldest living animals are bivalves. Yet, the origin of hemocytes, the cells involved in innate immunity, is unknown in bivalves and current knowledge about mollusk adult somatic stem cells is scarce. Here we identify a population of adult somatic precursor cells and show their differentiation into hemocytes. Oyster gill contains an as yet unreported irregularly folded structure (IFS) with stem-like cells bathing into the hemolymph. BrdU labeling revealed that the stem-like cells in the gill epithelium and in the nearby hemolymph replicate DNA. Proliferation of this cell population was further evidenced by phosphorylated-histone H3 mitotic staining. Finally, these small cells, most abundant in the IFS epithelium, were found to be positive for the stemness marker Sox2. We provide evidence for hematopoiesis by showing that co-expression of Sox2 and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, a hemocyte-specific enzyme, does not occur in the gill epithelial cells but rather in the underlying tissues and vessels. We further confirm the hematopoietic features of these cells by the detection of Filamin, a protein specific for a sub-population of hemocytes, in large BrdU-labeled cells bathing into gill vessels. Altogether, our data show that progenitor cells differentiate into hemocytes in the gill, which suggests that hematopoiesis occurs in oyster gills."},{"title":"Age at weaning, immunocompetence and ectoparasite performance in a precocial desert rodent","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3078","abstract":"We studied the effects of early weaning on immunocompetence and parasite resistance in a precocial rodent Acomys cahirinus. We hypothesized that if parasite resistance is energetically expensive and nutritional and immunological support from mothers are necessary for the long-term health of offspring, then early weaned animals would be immunologically weaker and less able to defend themselves against parasites than later weaned animals. We weaned pups at 14, 21 or 28 days after birth and assessed their immunocompetence and resistance against fleas Parapulex chephrenis when they attained adulthood. Immunocompetence was assessed using leukocyte concentration (LC) and a phytohaemagglutinin injection assay (PHA test). To estimate resistance against fleas, we measured performance of fleas via the number of produced eggs and duration of development and resistance to starvation of the flea offspring. We found a significant positive effect of weaning age on the PHA response but not on LC. The effect of age at weaning on flea egg production was manifested in male but not female hosts, with egg production being higher if a host was weaned at 14 than at 28 days. Weaning age of the host did not affect either duration of development or resistance to starvation of fleas produced by mothers fed on these hosts. We conclude that even in relatively precocial mammals, weaning age is an important indicator of future immunological responses and the ability of an animal to resist parasite infestations. Hosts weaned at an earlier age make easier, less-resistant targets for parasite infestations than hosts weaned later in life."},{"title":"Hydrodynamics and energetics of jumping copepod nauplii and copepodids","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3085","abstract":"Within its life cycle, a copepod goes through drastic changes in size, shape and swimming mode. In particular, there is a stark difference between the early (nauplius) and later (copepodid) stages. Copepods inhabit an intermediate Reynolds number regime (between ~1 and 100) where both viscosity and inertia are potentially important, and the Reynolds number changes by an order of magnitude during growth. Thus we expect the life stage related changes experienced by a copepod to result in hydrodynamic and energetic differences, ultimately affecting the fitness. To quantify these differences, we measured the swimming kinematics and fluid flow around jumping Acartia tonsa at different stages of its life cycle, using particle image velocimetry and particle tracking velocimetry. We found that the flow structures around nauplii and copepodids are topologically different, with one and two vortex rings, respectively. Our measurements suggest that copepodids cover a larger distance compared to their body size in each jump and are also hydrodynamically quieter, as the flow disturbance they create attenuates faster with distance. Also, copepodids are energetically more efficient than nauplii, presumably due to the change in hydrodynamic regime accompanied with a well-adapted body form and swimming stroke."},{"title":"Aquaporin expression in the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) in freshwater and seawater: challenging the paradigm of intestinal water transport?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3108","abstract":"We investigated the salinity-dependent expression dynamics of seven aquaporin paralogs (aqp1a, aqp3a, aqp7, aqp8ab, aqp10a, aqp10b and aqp11a) in several tissues of euryhaline Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). All paralogs except aqp7 and aqp10a had a broad tissue distribution, and several were affected by salinity in both osmoregulatory and non-osmoregulatory tissues. In the intestine, aqp1a, aqp7, aqp8ab and aqp10a decreased upon seawater (SW) acclimation in both long-term acclimated fish and during 1–3 days of the transition period. In the gill, aqp3a was lower and aqp10a higher in SW than in freshwater (FW). In the kidney no aqps were affected by salinity. In the skin, aqp1a and aqp3a were lower in SW than in FW. In the liver, aqp8ab and aqp10a were lower in SW than in FW. Furthermore, six Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit isoform transcripts were analysed in the intestine but none showed a consistent response to salinity, suggesting that water transport is not regulated at this level. In contrast, mRNA of the Na+,K+,2Cl−-cotransporter type-2 strongly increased in the intestine in SW compared with FW fish. Using custom-made antibodies, Aqp1a, Aqp8ab and Aqp10a were localized in the apical region of enterocytes of FW fish. Apical staining intensity strongly decreased, vanished or moved to subapical regions, when fish were acclimated to SW, supporting the lower mRNA expression in SW. Western blots confirmed the decrease in Aqp1a and Aqp10a in SW. The strong decrease in aquaporin expression in the intestine of SW fish is surprising, and challenges the paradigm for transepithelial intestinal water absorption in SW fishes."},{"title":"Altered regulation of sleep and feeding contributes to starvation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3122","abstract":"Animals respond to changes in food availability by adjusting sleep and foraging strategies to optimize their fitness. Wild populations of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, display highly variable levels of starvation resistance that are dependent on geographic location, food availability and evolutionary history. How behaviors that include sleep and feeding vary in Drosophila with increased starvation resistance is unclear. We have generated starvation-resistant flies through experimental evolution to investigate the relationship between foraging behaviors and starvation resistance. Outbred populations of D. melanogaster were selected for starvation resistance over 60 generations. This selection process resulted in flies with a threefold increase in total lipids that survive up to 18 days without food. We tested starvation-selected (S) flies for sleep and feeding behaviors to determine the effect that selection for starvation resistance has had on foraging behavior. Flies from three replicated starvation-selected populations displayed a dramatic reduction in feeding and prolonged sleep duration compared to fed control (F) populations, suggesting that modified sleep and feeding may contribute to starvation resistance. A prolonged larval developmental period contributes to the elevated energy stores present in starvation-selected flies. By preventing S larvae from feeding longer than F larvae, we were able to reduce energy stores in adult S flies to the levels seen in adult F flies, thus allowing us to control for energy storage levels. However, the reduction of energy stores in S flies fails to generate normal sleep and feeding behavior seen in F flies with similar energy stores. These findings suggest that the behavioral changes observed in S flies are due to genetic regulation of behavior rather than elevated lipid levels. Testing S-F hybrid individuals for both feeding and sleep revealed a lack of correlation between food consumption and sleep duration, indicating further independence in genetic factors underlying the sleep and feeding changes observed in S flies. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that starvation selection results in prolonged sleep and reduced feeding through a mechanism that is independent of elevated energy stores. These findings suggest that changes in both metabolic function and behavior contribute to the increase in starvation resistance seen in flies selected for starvation resistance."},{"title":"Thermal effects on the performance, motor control and muscle dynamics of ballistic feeding in the salamander Eurycea guttolineata","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3146","abstract":"Temperature strongly affects muscle contractile rate properties and thus may influence whole-organism performance. Movements powered by elastic recoil, however, are known to be more thermally robust than muscle-powered movements. We examined the whole-organism performance, motor control and muscle contractile physiology underlying feeding in the salamander Eurycea guttolineata. We compared elastically powered tongue projection with the associated muscle-powered retraction to determine the thermal robustness of each of these functional levels. We found that tongue-projection distance in E. guttolineata was unaffected by temperature across the entire 4–26°C range, tongue-projection dynamics were significantly affected by temperature across only the 4–11°C interval, and tongue retraction was affected to a higher degree across the entire temperature range. The significant effect of temperature on projection dynamics across the 4–11°C interval corresponds to a significant decline in projector muscle burst intensity and peak contractile force of the projector muscle across the same interval. Across the remaining temperature range, however, projection dynamics were unaffected by temperature, with muscle contractile physiology showing typical thermal effects and motor patterns showing increased activity durations and latencies. These results reveal that elastically powered tongue-projection performance in E. guttolineata is maintained to a higher degree than muscle-powered tongue retraction performance across a wide temperature range. These results further indicate that thermal robustness of the elastically powered movement is dependent on motor control and muscle physiology that results in comparable energy being stored in elastic tissues across a range of temperatures."},{"title":"Tendon elastic strain energy in the human ankle plantar-flexors and its role with increased running speed","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3159","abstract":"The human ankle plantar-flexors, the soleus and gastrocnemius, utilize tendon elastic strain energy to reduce muscle fiber work and optimize contractile conditions during running. However, studies to date have considered only slow to moderate running speeds up to 5 m s−1. Little is known about how the human ankle plantar-flexors utilize tendon elastic strain energy as running speed is advanced towards maximum sprinting. We used data obtained from gait experiments in conjunction with musculoskeletal modeling and optimization techniques to calculate muscle–tendon unit (MTU) work, tendon elastic strain energy and muscle fiber work for the ankle plantar-flexors as participants ran at five discrete steady-state speeds ranging from jogging (~2 m s−1) to sprinting (≥8 m s−1). As running speed progressed from jogging to sprinting, the contribution of tendon elastic strain energy to the positive work generated by the MTU increased from 53% to 74% for the soleus and from 62% to 75% for the gastrocnemius. This increase was facilitated by greater muscle activation and the relatively isometric behavior of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscle fibers. Both of these characteristics enhanced tendon stretch and recoil, which contributed to the bulk of the change in MTU length. Our results suggest that as steady-state running speed is advanced towards maximum sprinting, the human ankle plantar-flexors continue to prioritize the storage and recovery of tendon elastic strain energy over muscle fiber work."},{"title":"Opsin expression in Limulus eyes: a UV opsin is expressed in each eye type and co-expressed with a visible light-sensitive opsin in ventral larval eyes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3133","abstract":"The eyes of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, are a model for studies of visual function and the visual systems of euarthropods. Much is known about the structure and function of L. polyphemus photoreceptors, much less about their photopigments. Three visible-light-sensitive L. polyphemus opsins were characterized previously (LpOps1, 2 and 5). Here we characterize a UV opsin (LpUVOps1) that is expressed in all three types of L. polyphemus eyes. It is expressed in most photoreceptors in median ocelli, the only L. polyphemus eyes in which UV sensitivity was previously detected, and in the dendrite of eccentric cells in lateral compound eyes. Therefore, eccentric cells, previously thought to be non-photosensitive second-order neurons, may actually be UV-sensitive photoreceptors. LpUVOps1 is also expressed in small photoreceptors in L. polyphemus ventral larval eyes, and intracellular recordings from these photoreceptors confirm that LpUVOps1 is an active, UV-sensitive photopigment. These photoreceptors also express LpOps5, which we demonstrate is an active, long-wavelength-sensitive photopigment. Thus small photoreceptors in ventral larval eyes, and probably those of the other larval eyes, have dual sensitivity to UV and visible light. Interestingly, the spectral tuning of small ventral photoreceptors may change day to night, because the level of LpOps5 in their rhabdoms is lower during the day than during the night, whereas LpUVOps1 levels show no diurnal change. These and previous findings show that opsin co-expression and the differential regulation of co-expressed opsins in rhabdoms is a common feature of L. polyphemus photoreceptors."},{"title":"Learning to cope with degraded sounds: female zebra finches can improve their expertise in discriminating between male voices at long distances","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3169","abstract":"Reliable transmission of acoustic information about individual identity is of critical importance for pair bond maintenance in numerous monogamous songbirds. However, information transfer can be impaired by environmental constraints such as external noise or propagation-induced degradation. Birds have been shown to use several adaptive strategies to deal with difficult signal transmission contexts. Specifically, a number of studies have suggested that vocal plasticity at the emitter's level allows birds to counteract the deleterious effects of sound degradation. Although the communication process involves both the emitter and the receiver, perceptual plasticity at the receiver's level has received little attention. Here, we explored the reliability of individual recognition by female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), testing whether perceptual training can improve discrimination of degraded individual vocal signatures. We found that female zebra finches are proficient in discriminating between calls of individual males at long distances, and even more so when they can train themselves with increasingly degraded signals over time. In this latter context, females succeed in discriminating between males as far as 250 m. This result emphasizes that adaptation to adverse communication conditions may involve not only the emitter's vocal plasticity but also the receptor's decoding process through on-going learning."},{"title":"Precocene-I inhibits juvenile hormone biosynthesis, ovarian activation, aggression and alters sterility signal production in bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) workers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3178","abstract":"Juvenile hormone (JH) is an important regulator of development and physiology in insects. While in many insect species, including bumble bees, JH functions as gonadotropin in adults, in some highly eusocial insects its role has shifted to regulate social behavior including division of labor, dominance and aggression. Studying JH functions across social insect species is important for understanding the evolution of sociality; however, these studies have been limited because of the inability to reduce JH levels without surgically removing its glandular source, the corpora allata. Precocene is known to inhibit JH biosynthesis in several non-social insects, but has been poorly studied in social insects. Here, we tested whether precocene-I can effectively reduce JH levels in Bombus terrestris workers, and examined its effects on their physiology and behavior. Precocene-I treatment of three-worker groups decreased JH titer and ovarian activation, irrespective of the bees' dominance rank within the group, and was remedied by JH replacement therapy. Precocene-I also decreased aggressiveness and increased ester-sterility signal production; these changes were rank-dependent, and affected mainly the most reproductive and the least aggressive workers, respectively, and could not be remedied by JH replacement therapy. These results clearly confirm the role of JH as a gonadotropin and mediator of aggression in B. terrestris, and indicate that JH effects are associated with worker dominance rank. The ability to chemically reduce JH titer provides us with a non-intrusive method to probe the evolutionary changes associated with JH and the hormonal mechanisms that are associated with reproduction and behavior in social insects."},{"title":"Hemolymph circulation in insect sensory appendages: functional mechanics of antennal accessory pulsatile organs (auxiliary hearts) in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3006","abstract":"Mosquito antennae provide sensory input that modulates host-seeking, mating and oviposition behaviors. Thus, mosquitoes must ensure the efficient transport of molecules into and out of these appendages. To accomplish this, mosquitoes and other insects have evolved antennal accessory pulsatile organs (APOs) that drive hemolymph into the antennal space. This study characterizes the structural mechanics of hemolymph propulsion throughout the antennae of Anopheles gambiae. Using intravital video imaging, we show that mosquitoes possess paired antennal APOs that are located on each side of the head's dorsal midline. They are situated between the frons and the vertex in an area that is dorsal to the antenna but ventral to the medial-most region of the compound eyes. Antennal APOs contract in synchrony at 1 Hz, which is 45% slower than the heart. By means of histology and intravital imaging, we show that each antennal APO propels hemolymph into the antenna through an antennal vessel that traverses the length of the appendage and has an effective diameter of 1–2 μm. When hemolymph reaches the end of the appendage, it is discharged into the antennal hemocoel and returns to the head. Because a narrow vessel empties into a larger cavity, hemolymph travels up the antenna at 0.2 mm s−1 but reduces its velocity by 75% as it returns to the head. Finally, treatment of mosquitoes with the anesthetic agent FlyNap (triethylamine) increases both antennal APO and heart contraction rates. In summary, this study presents a comprehensive functional characterization of circulatory physiology in the mosquito antennae."},{"title":"Effects of feeding on in vivo motility patterns in the proximal intestine of shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3015","abstract":"This is the first study to catalogue the diverse array of in vivo motility patterns in a teleost fish and how they are affected by feeding. Video recordings of exteriorised proximal intestine from fasted and fed shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) were used to generate spatio-temporal maps to portray and quantify motility patterns. Propagating and non-propagating contractions were observed to occur at different frequencies and durations. The most apparent difference between the feeding states was that bands of relatively high amplitude contractions propagating slowly in the anal direction were observed in all fasted fish (N=10) but in only 35% of fed fish (N=11). Additionally, fed fish displayed a reduced frequency (0.21±0.03 versus 0.32±0.06 contractions min−1) and rhythmicity of these contractions compared with fasted fish. Although the underlying mechanisms of these slow anally propagating contractions differ from those of mammalian migrating motor complexes, we believe that they may play a similar role in shorthorn sculpin during the interdigestive period, to potentially remove food remnants and prevent the establishment of pathogens. ‘Ripples’ were the most prevalent contraction type in shorthorn sculpin and may be important during mixing and absorption. The persistence of shallow ripples and pendular movements of longitudinal muscle after tetrodotoxin (1 μmol l−1) treatment suggests these contractions were myogenic in origin. The present study highlights both similarities and differences in motility patterns between shorthorn sculpin and other vertebrates, as well as providing a platform to examine other aspects of gastrointestinal functions in fish, including the impact of environmental changes."},{"title":"A whispering bat that screams: bimodal switch of foraging guild from gleaning to aerial hawking in the desert long-eared bat","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3028","abstract":"Echolocating bats have historically been classified as either loud aerial hawkers or whispering gleaners. Some bat species can forage in multiple ways and others have demonstrated limited flexibility in the amplitude of their echolocation calls. The desert long-eared bat, Otonycteris hemprichii, has been said to be a passive gleaning whispering bat preying on terrestrial arthropods such as scorpions. Using an acoustic tracking system, we recorded individuals flying at foraging and drinking sites and compared their flight height, flight speed, call duration, pulse interval and source levels with those of gleaning individuals previously recorded using the same setup. We found differences in all variables with the strongest difference in source levels, where bats called at a mean of 119 dB peSPL (compared with 75 dB peSPL when gleaning). Bat faecal analysis indicated that their diet differed from previous studies and that prey species were capable of flight. We conclude that the bats switched from passive gleaning to capturing airborne insects (aerial hawking). Although whispering bats have been known to opportunistically catch insects on the wing, in the present study we show a full bimodal switch between foraging guilds with the respective changes in source level to those typical of a true aerial hawker."},{"title":"Thermal limitation of performance and biogeography in a free-ranging ectotherm: insights from accelerometry","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3033","abstract":"Theoretical and laboratory studies generally show that ectotherm performance increases with temperature to an optimum, and subsequently declines. Several physiological mechanisms probably shape thermal performance curves, but responses of free-ranging animals to temperature variation will represent a compromise between these mechanisms and ecological constraints. Thermal performance data from wild animals balancing physiology and ecology are rare, and this represents a hindrance for predicting population impacts of future temperature change. We used internally implanted accelerometers near the middle of a species' geographical distribution and gill-net catch data near the species' latitudinal extremes to quantify temperature-related activity levels of a wild predatory fish (Platycephalus fuscus). We examined our data in the context of established models of thermal performance, and the relationship between thermal performance thresholds and biogeography. Acceleration data approximated a thermal performance curve, with activity peaking at 23°C but declining rapidly at higher temperatures. Gill-net catch data displayed a similar trend, with a temperature-associated increase and decrease in catch rates in temperate and tropical regions, respectively. Extrapolated estimates of zero activity (CTmin and CTmax) from the accelerometers were similar to the minimum and maximum mean monthly water temperatures experienced at the southern and northern (respectively) limits of the species distribution, consistent with performance-limited biogeography in this species. These data highlight the fundamental influence of temperature on ectotherm performance, and how thermal performance limits may shape biogeography. Biologging approaches are rarely used to examine thermal performance curves in free-ranging animals, but these may be central to understanding the trade-offs between physiology and ecology that constrain species' biogeographies and determine the susceptibility of ectotherms to future increases in temperature."},{"title":"Risks of multimodal signaling: bat predators attend to dynamic motion in frog sexual displays","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3038","abstract":"Many sexual displays contain multiple components that are received through a variety of sensory modalities. Primary and secondary signal components can interact to induce novel receiver responses and become targets of sexual selection as complex signals. However, predators can also use these complex signals for prey assessment, which may limit the evolution of elaborate sexual signals. We tested whether a multimodal sexual display of the male túngara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) increases predation risk from the fringe-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus) when compared with a unimodal display. We gave bats a choice to attack one of two frog models: a model with a vocal sac moving in synchrony with a mating call (multisensory cue), or a control model with the call but no vocal sac movement (unimodal cue). Bats preferred to attack the model associated with the multimodal display. Furthermore, we determined that bats perceive the vocal sac using echolocation rather than visual cues. Our data illustrate the costs associated with multimodal signaling and that sexual and natural selection pressures on the same trait are not always mediated through the same sensory modalities. These data are important when considering the role of environmental fluctuations on signal evolution as different sensory modalities will be differentially affected."},{"title":"Enhanced memory persistence is blocked by a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor in the snail Lymnaea stagnalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2920","abstract":"Lymnaea stagnalis provides an excellent model system for studying memory because these snails have a well-described set of neurons, a single one of which controls expression of long-term memory of operantly conditioned respiratory behavior. We have shown that several different manipulations, including pre-training exposure to serotonin (5-HT) or methamphetamine, submersion of snails after training to prevent memory interference, and exposure to effluent from predatory crayfish (CE), enhance memory persistence. Changes in DNA methylation underlie formation of strong memories in mammals and 5-HT-enhanced long-term facilitation in Aplysia. Here we determined the impact of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-AZA; 87 μmol l−1), on enhanced memory persistence by all four manipulations. We found that 5-HT (100 μmol l−1) enhanced memory persistence, which was blocked by 5-AZA pretreatment. Snails pre-exposed to 3.3 μmol l−1 Meth 4 h prior to training demonstrated memory 72 h later, which was not present in controls. This memory-enhancing effect was blocked by pre-treatment with 87 μmol l−1 5-AZA. Similarly, submersion to prevent interference learning as well as training in CE produced memory that was not present in controls, and these effects were blocked by pre-treatment with 87 μmol l−1 5-AZA. In contrast, 5-AZA injection did not alter expression of normal (non-enhanced) memory, suggesting that these four stimuli enhance memory persistence by increasing DNA methyltransferase activity, which, in turn, increases expression of memory-enhancing genes and/or inhibits memory suppressor genes. These studies lay important groundwork for delineating gene methylation changes that are common to persistent memory produced by different stimuli."},{"title":"Cold-induced depolarization of insect muscle: differing roles of extracellular K+ during acute and chronic chilling","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2930","abstract":"Insects enter chill coma, a reversible state of paralysis, at temperatures below their critical thermal minimum (CTmin), and the time required for an insect to recover after a cold exposure is termed chill coma recovery time (CCRT). The CTmin and CCRT are both important metrics of insect cold tolerance that are used interchangeably, although chill coma recovery is not necessarily permitted by a direct reversal of the mechanism causing chill coma onset. Nevertheless, onset and recovery of coma have been attributed to loss of neuromuscular function due to depolarization of muscle fibre membrane potential (Vm). Here we test the hypothesis that muscle depolarization at chill coma onset and repolarization during chill coma recovery are caused by changes in extracellular [K+] and/or other effects of low temperature. Using Locusta migratoria, we measured in vivo muscle resting potentials of the extensor tibialis during cooling, following prolonged exposure to −2°C and during chill coma recovery, and related changes in Vm to transmembrane [K+] balance and temperature. Although Vm was rapidly depolarized by cooling, hemolymph [K+] did not rise until locusts had spent considerable time in the cold. Nonetheless, a rise in hemolymph [K+] during prolonged cold exposure further depressed muscle resting potential and slowed recovery from chill coma upon rewarming. Muscle resting potentials had a bimodal distribution, and with elevation of extracellular [K+] (but not temperature) muscle resting potentials become unimodal. Thus, a disruption of extracellular [K+] does depolarize muscle resting potential and slow CCRT following prolonged cold exposure. However, onset of chill coma at the CTmin relates to an as-yet-unknown effect of temperature on neuromuscular function."},{"title":"Analyses of the mouthpart kinematics in Periplaneta americana (Blattodea, Blattidae) using synchrotron-based X-ray cineradiography","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/17/3095","abstract":"The kinematics of the biting and chewing mouthparts of insects is a complex interaction of various components forming multiple jointed chains. The non-invasive technique of in vivo cineradiography by means of synchrotron radiation was employed to elucidate the motion cycles of the mouthparts in the cockroach Periplaneta americana. Digital X-ray footage sequences were used in order to calculate pre-defined angles and distances, each representing characteristic aspects of the movement pattern. We were able to analyze the interactions of the mouthpart components and to generate a functional model of maxillary movement by integrating kinematic results, morphological dissections and fluorescence microscopy. During the opening and closing cycles, which take about 450–500 ms on average, we found strong correlations between the measured maxillary and mandibular angles, indicating a strong neural coordination of these movements. This is manifested by strong antiphasic courses of the maxillae and the mandibles, antiphasic patterns of the rotation of the cardo about its basic articulation at the head and by the deflection between the cardo and stipes. In our functional model of the maxilla, its movement pattern is explained by the antagonistic activity of four adductor-promotor muscles and two abductor-remotor muscles. However, beyond the observed intersegmental and bilateral stereotypy, certain amounts of variation across subsequent cycles within a sequence were observed with respect to the degree of correlation between the various mouthparts, the maximum, minimum and time course of the angular movements. Although generally correlated with the movement pattern of the mandibles and the maxillary cardo-stipes complex, such plastic behaviour was especially observed in the maxillary palpi and the labium."},{"title":"Fast and slow processes underlie the selection of both step frequency and walking speed","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2939","abstract":"People prefer gaits that minimize their energetic cost. Research focused on step frequency selection suggests that a fast predictive process and a slower optimization process underlie this energy optimization. Our purpose in this study was to test whether the mechanisms controlling step frequency selection are used more generally to select one of the most relevant characteristics of walking – preferred speed. To accomplish this, we contrasted the dynamic adjustments in speed following perturbations to step frequency against the dynamic adjustments in step frequency following perturbations to speed. Despite the use of different perturbations and contexts, we found that the responses were very similar. In both experiments, subjects responded to perturbations by first rapidly changing their speed or step frequency towards their preferred pattern, and then slowly adjusting their gait to converge onto their preferred pattern. We measured similar response times for both the fast processes (1.4±0.3 versus 2.7±0.6 s) and the slow processes (74.2±25.4 versus 79.7±20.2 s). We also found that the fast process, although quite variable in amplitude, dominated the adjustments in both speed and step frequency. These distinct but complementary experiments demonstrate that people appear to rely heavily on prediction to rapidly select the most relevant aspects of their preferred gait and then gradually fine-tune that selection, perhaps using direct optimization of energetic cost."},{"title":"Forward shift of feeding buzz components of dolphins and belugas during associative learning reveals a likely connection to reward expectation, pleasure and brain dopamine activation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2910","abstract":"For many years, we heard sounds associated with reward from dolphins and belugas. We named these pulsed sounds victory squeals (VS), as they remind us of a child's squeal of delight. Here we put these sounds in context with natural and learned behavior. Like bats, echolocating cetaceans produce feeding buzzes as they approach and catch prey. Unlike bats, cetaceans continue their feeding buzzes after prey capture and the after portion is what we call the VS. Prior to training (or conditioning), the VS comes after the fish reward; with repeated trials it moves to before the reward. During training, we use a whistle or other sound to signal a correct response by the animal. This sound signal, named a secondary reinforcer (SR), leads to the primary reinforcer, fish. Trainers usually name their whistle or other SR a bridge, as it bridges the time gap between the correct response and reward delivery. During learning, the SR becomes associated with reward and the VS comes after the SR rather than after the fish. By following the SR, the VS confirms that the animal expects a reward. Results of early brain stimulation work suggest to us that SR stimulates brain dopamine release, which leads to the VS. Although there are no direct studies of dopamine release in cetaceans, we found that the timing of our VS is consistent with a response after dopamine release. We compared trained vocal responses to auditory stimuli with VS responses to SR sounds. Auditory stimuli that did not signal reward resulted in faster responses by a mean of 151 ms for dolphins and 250 ms for belugas. In laboratory animals, there is a 100 to 200 ms delay for dopamine release. VS delay in our animals is similar and consistent with vocalization after dopamine release. Our novel observation suggests that the dopamine reward system is active in cetacean brains."},{"title":"High fatty acid oxidation capacity and phosphorylation control despite elevated leak and reduced respiratory capacity in northern elephant seal muscle mitochondria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2947","abstract":"Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) are extreme, hypoxia-adapted endotherms that rely largely on aerobic metabolism during extended breath-hold dives in near-freezing water temperatures. While many aspects of their physiology have been characterized to account for these remarkable feats, the contribution of adaptations in the aerobic powerhouses of muscle cells, the mitochondria, are unknown. In the present study, the ontogeny and comparative physiology of elephant seal muscle mitochondrial respiratory function was investigated under a variety of substrate conditions and respiratory states. Intact mitochondrial networks were studied by high-resolution respirometry in saponin-permeabilized fiber bundles obtained from primary swimming muscles of pup, juvenile and adult seals, and compared with fibers from adult human vastus lateralis. Results indicate that seal muscle maintains a high capacity for fatty acid oxidation despite a progressive decrease in total respiratory capacity as animals mature from pups to adults. This is explained by a progressive increase in phosphorylation control and fatty acid utilization over pyruvate in adult seals compared with humans and seal pups. Interestingly, despite higher indices of oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, juvenile and adult seals also exhibit a ~50% greater capacity for respiratory ‘leak’ compared with humans and seal pups. The ontogeny of this phenotype suggests it is an adaptation of muscle to the prolonged breath-hold exercise and highly variable ambient temperatures experienced by mature elephant seals. These studies highlight the remarkable plasticity of mammalian mitochondria to meet the demands for both efficient ATP production and endothermy in a cold, oxygen-limited environment."},{"title":"Multiplexed modulation of behavioral choice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2963","abstract":"Stimuli in the environment, as well as internal states, influence behavioral choice. Of course, animals are often exposed to multiple external and internal factors simultaneously, which makes the ultimate determinants of behavior quite complex. We observed the behavioral responses of European leeches, Hirudo verbana, as we varied one external factor (surrounding water depth) with either another external factor (location of tactile stimulation along the body) or an internal factor (body distention following feeding). Stimulus location proved to be the primary indicator of behavioral response. In general, anterior stimulation produced shortening behavior, midbody stimulation produced local bending, and posterior stimulation usually produced either swimming or crawling but sometimes a hybrid of the two. By producing a systematically measured map of behavioral responses to body stimulation, we found wide areas of overlap between behaviors. When we varied the surrounding water depth, this map changed significantly, and a new feature – rotation of the body along its long axis prior to swimming – appeared. We found additional interactions between water depth and time since last feeding. A large blood meal initially made the animals crawl more and swim less, an effect that was attenuated as water depth increased. The behavioral map returned to its pre-feeding form after approximately 3 weeks as the leeches digested their blood meal. In summary, we found multiplexed impacts on behavioral choice, with the map of responses to tactile stimulation modified by water depth, which itself modulated the impact that feeding had on the decision to swim or crawl."},{"title":"Pre-start timing information is used to set final linear speed in a C-start manoeuvre","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2866","abstract":"In their unique hunting behaviour, archerfish use a complex motor decision to secure their prey: based solely on how dislodged prey initially falls, they select an adapted C-start manoeuvre that turns the fish right towards the point on the water surface where their prey will later land. Furthermore, they take off at a speed that is set so as to arrive in time. We show here that the C-start manoeuvre and not subsequent tail beating is necessary and sufficient for setting this adaptive level of speed. Furthermore, the C-start pattern is adjusted to independently determine both the turning angle and the take-off speed. The selection of both aspects requires no a priori information and is done based on information sampled from the onset of target motion until the C-start is launched. Fin strokes can occur right after the C-start manoeuvre but are not required to fine-tune take-off speed, but rather to maintain it. By probing the way in which the fish set their take-off speed in a wide range of conditions in which distance from the later catching point and time until impact varied widely and unpredictably, we found that the C-start manoeuvre is programmed based on pre-C-start estimates of distance and time until impact. Our study hence provides the first evidence for a C-start that is fine-tuned to produce an adaptive speed level."},{"title":"Blood flow for bone remodelling correlates with locomotion in living and extinct birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2956","abstract":"Nutrient arteries enter limb bones through discrete foramina on the shafts. They are required for bone remodelling in response to mechanical loading and dynamic forces imposed by locomotion. The cross-sectional area of the nutrient foramen of the femur represents an index of blood flow rate to the shaft and thus provides insight into the animal's level of activity. Morphometric data on femoral length, mass and foramen size from 100 extant bird species and eight extinct moa species were analysed allometrically and phylogenetically. The nutrient foramen blood flow index (Qi) and femur mass (Mf) increase with body mass (Mb). At 1 kg body mass, cursorial species have approximately 2.1 times higher Qi and 1.9 times heavier Mf than volant species. The scaling of Qi on Mf is independent of the primary mode of locomotion, but the ratio Qi/Mf decreases significantly in larger birds, although absolute Qi increases. The overall avian equation for Qi on Mb is not significantly different from previous data from mammals, but when differences in blood pressure are accounted for, estimated blood flow to the femur is approximately 1.9 times higher in cursorial birds than in mammals, possibly in relation to bipedalism and quadrupedalism, respectively. Femoral bone blood flow in both endothermic groups is estimated to be 50–100 times higher than in ectothermic reptiles."},{"title":"Functional characterization of a short neuropeptide F-related receptor in a lophotrochozoan, the mollusk Crassostrea gigas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2974","abstract":"Members of the short neuropeptide F (sNPF) family of peptides and their cognate receptors play key roles in a variety of physiological processes in arthropods. In silico screening of GigasDatabase, a specific expressed sequence tag database from the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, resulted in the identification of a receptor (Cg-sNPFR-like) phylogenetically closely related to sNPF receptors (sNPFRs) of insects. A reverse endocrinology approach was undertaken to identify the peptide ligand(s) of this orphan receptor. Though structurally distinct from insect sNPFs, three RFamide peptides derived from the same precursor, i.e. GSLFRFamide, SSLFRFamide and GALFRFamide, specifically activate the receptor in a dose-dependent manner, with respective EC50 values (half-maximal effective concentrations) of 1.1, 2.1 and 4.1 μmol l−1. We found that both Cg-sNPFR-like receptor and LFRFamide encoding transcripts are expressed in the oyster central nervous system and in other tissues as well, albeit at lower levels. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the wide distribution of LFRFamide mature peptides in several central and peripheral tissues. The Cg-sNPFR-like receptor was more abundantly expressed in ganglia of females than of males, and upregulated in starved oysters. In the gonad area, highest receptor gene expression occurred at the start of gametogenesis, when storage activity is maximal. Our results suggest that signaling of LFRFamide peptides through the Cg-sNPFR-like receptor might play a role in the coordination of nutrition, energy storage and metabolism in C. gigas, possibly by promoting storage at the expense of reproduction."},{"title":"Rh versus pH: the role of Rhesus glycoproteins in renal ammonia excretion during metabolic acidosis in a freshwater teleost fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2855","abstract":"Increased renal ammonia excretion in response to metabolic acidosis is thought to be a conserved response in vertebrates. We tested the hypothesis that Rhesus (Rh) glycoproteins in the kidney of the freshwater common carp, Cyprinus carpio, play a crucial role in regulating renal ammonia excretion during chronic metabolic acidosis. Exposure to water pH 4.0 (72 h) resulted in a classic metabolic acidosis with reduced plasma arterial pH and [HCO3−], no change in PCO2 and large changes in renal function. Urine [NH4+] as well as [titratable acidity-HCO3−] rose significantly over the acid exposure, but the profound reduction (fivefold) in urine flow rates eliminated the expected elevations in renal ammonia excretion. Low urine flow rates may be a primary strategy to conserve ions, as urinary excretion rates of Na+, Cl− and Ca2+ were significantly lower during the acid exposure relative to the control period. Interestingly, renal Rhcg1 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in acid-exposed relative to control groups, along with mRNA levels of several ion transporters, including the Na+/H+ exchanger, H+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed a strong apical Rhcg1 signal in distal tubules. Taken together, these data show that renal Rh glycoproteins and associated ion transporters are responsive to metabolic acidosis, but conservation of ions through reduced urine flow rates takes primacy over renal acid–base regulation in the freshwater C. carpio. We propose that an ‘acid/base–ion balance’ compromise explains the variable renal responses to metabolic acidosis in freshwater teleosts."},{"title":"Echolocation behaviour of the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) in an obstacle avoidance task of increasing difficulty","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2876","abstract":"Four big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) were challenged in an obstacle avoidance experiment to localize vertically stretched wires requiring progressively greater accuracy by diminishing the wire-to-wire distance from 50 to 10 cm. The performance of the bats decreased with decreasing gap size. The avoidance task became very difficult below a wire separation of 30 cm, which corresponds to the average wingspan of E. fuscus. Two of the bats were able to pass without collisions down to a gap size of 10 cm in some of the flights. The other two bats only managed to master gap sizes down to 20 and 30 cm, respectively. They also performed distinctly worse at all other gap sizes. With increasing difficulty of the task, the bats changed their flight and echolocation behaviour. Especially at gap sizes of 30 cm and below, flight paths increased in height and flight speed was reduced. In addition, the bats emitted approach signals that were arranged in groups. At all gap sizes, the largest numbers of pulses per group were observed in the last group before passing the obstacle. The more difficult the obstacle avoidance task, the more pulses there were in the groups and the shorter the within-group pulse intervals. In comparable situations, the better-performing bats always emitted groups with more pulses than the less well-performing individuals. We hypothesize that the accuracy of target localization increases with the number of pulses per group and that each group is processed as a package."},{"title":"Adaptive changes in echolocation sounds by Pipistrellus abramus in response to artificial jamming sounds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2885","abstract":"The echolocation behavior of Pipistrellus abramus during exposure to artificial jamming sounds during flight was investigated. Echolocation pulses emitted by the bats were recorded using a telemetry microphone mounted on the bats' backs, and their adaptation based on acoustic characteristics of emitted pulses was assessed in terms of jamming-avoidance responses (JARs). In experiment 1, frequency-modulated jamming sounds (3 ms duration) mimicking echolocation pulses of P. abramus were prepared. All bats showed significant increases in the terminal frequency of the frequency-modulated pulse by an average of 2.1–4.5 kHz when the terminal frequency of the jamming sounds was lower than the bats' own pulses. This frequency shift was not observed using jamming frequencies that overlapped with or were higher than the bats' own pulses. These findings suggest that JARs in P. abramus are sensitive to the terminal frequency of jamming pulses and that the bats' response pattern was dependent on the slight difference in stimulus frequency. In experiment 2, when bats were repeatedly exposed to a band-limited noise of 70 ms duration, the bats in flight more frequently emitted pulses during silent periods between jamming sounds, suggesting that the bats could actively change the timing of pulse emissions, even during flight, to avoid temporal overlap with jamming sounds. Our findings demonstrate that bats could adjust their vocalized frequency and emission timing during flight in response to acoustic jamming stimuli."},{"title":"Strong negative effects of simulated heat waves in a tropical butterfly","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2892","abstract":"Climate change poses a significant challenge to all natural systems on Earth. Especially increases in extreme weather events such as heat waves have the potential to strongly affect biodiversity, though their effects are poorly understood because of a lack of empirical data. Therefore, we here explore the sensitivity of a tropical ectotherm, which are in general believed to have a low warming tolerance, to experimentally simulated climate change using ecologically realistic diurnal temperature cycles. Increasing the mean temperature permanently by 3°C had mostly minor effects on developmental traits in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Simulated heat waves (strongly elevated temperatures for some time though retaining the same overall temperature mean), in contrast, caused strong negative effects by prolonging development time (by up to 10%) and reducing body mass (−21%), especially when combined with reduced relative humidity. Detrimental effects were carried over into the adult stage, diminishing subsequent performance. Most strikingly, higher temperatures suppressed adult immune function (haemocytes: −54%, lysozyme activity: −32%), which may potentially change the way species interact with antagonists. Heat waves thus reduced fitness parameters by 10–25% for development time and body mass and by up to 54% for immune parameters even in this plastic and widespread butterfly, exemplifying the potentially dramatic impact of extreme weather events on biodiversity."},{"title":"Ultraviolet vision in lacertid lizards: evidence from retinal structure, eye transmittance, SWS1 visual pigment genes and behaviour","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/16/2899","abstract":"Ultraviolet (UV) vision and UV colour patches have been reported in a wide range of taxa and are increasingly appreciated as an integral part of vertebrate visual perception and communication systems. Previous studies with Lacertidae, a lizard family with diverse and complex coloration, have revealed the existence of UV-reflecting patches that may function as social signals. However, confirmation of the signalling role of UV coloration requires demonstrating that the lizards are capable of vision in the UV waveband. Here we use a multidisciplinary approach to characterize the visual sensitivity of a diverse sample of lacertid species. Spectral transmission measurements of the ocular media show that wavelengths down to 300 nm are transmitted in all the species sampled. Four retinal oil droplet types can be identified in the lacertid retina. Two types are pigmented and two are colourless. Fluorescence microscopy reveals that a type of colourless droplet is UV-transmitting and may thus be associated with UV-sensitive cones. DNA sequencing shows that lacertids have a functional SWS1 opsin, very similar at 13 critical sites to that in the presumed ancestral vertebrate (which was UV sensitive) and other UV-sensitive lizards. Finally, males of Podarcis muralis are capable of discriminating between two views of the same stimulus that differ only in the presence/absence of UV radiance. Taken together, these results provide convergent evidence of UV vision in lacertids, very likely by means of an independent photopigment. Moreover, the presence of four oil droplet types suggests that lacertids have a four-cone colour vision system."},{"title":"Head movements and the optic flow generated during the learning flights of bumblebees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2633","abstract":"Insects inform themselves about the 3D structure of their surroundings through motion parallax. During flight, they often simplify this task by minimising rotational image movement. Coordinated head and body movements generate rapid shifts of gaze separated by periods of almost zero rotational movement, during which the distance of objects from the insect can be estimated through pure translational optic flow. This saccadic strategy is less appropriate for assessing the distance between objects. Bees and wasps face this problem when learning the position of their nest-hole relative to objects close to it. They acquire the necessary information during specialised flights performed on leaving the nest. Here, we show that the bumblebee's saccadic strategy differs from other reported cases. In the fixations between saccades, a bumblebee's head continues to turn slowly, generating rotational flow. At specific points in learning flights these imperfect fixations generate a form of ‘pivoting parallax’, which is centred on the nest and enhances the visibility of features near the nest. Bumblebees may thus utilize an alternative form of motion parallax to that delivered by the standard ‘saccade and fixate’ strategy in which residual rotational flow plays a role in assessing the distances of objects from a focal point of interest."},{"title":"Following the sun: a mathematical analysis of the tracks of clock-shifted homing pigeons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2643","abstract":"We analysed the tracks of clock-shifted pigeons from six releases to determine how they cope with the conflict between their sun compass and other navigational cues. Time-lag embedding was used to calculate the short-term correlation dimension, a parameter that reflects the complexity of the navigational system, and with it, the number of factors involved. Initially, while pigeons were still at the release site, the short-term correlation dimension was low; it increased as the birds left the site, indicating that the birds were now actively navigating. Clock-shifted pigeons showed more scatter than the control birds, and their short-term correlation dimension became significantly smaller than that of the controls, remaining lower until the experimental birds reached their loft. This difference was small, but consistent, and suggests a different rating and ranking of the navigational cues. Clock-shifted pigeons do not seem to simply ignore the information from their manipulated sun compass altogether, but appear to merely downgrade it in favour of other cues, like their magnetic compass. This is supported by the observation that the final part of the tracks still showed a small deviation in the expected direction, indicating an effect of clock-shifting until the end of the homing flight."},{"title":"Transition from wing to leg forces during landing in birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2659","abstract":"Transitions to and from the air are critical for aerial locomotion and likely shaped the evolution of flying animals. Research on take-off demonstrates that legs generate greater body accelerations compared with wings, and thereby contribute more to initial flight velocity. Here, we explored coordination between wings and legs in two species with different wingbeat styles, and quantified force production of these modules during the final phase of landing. We used the same birds that we had previously studied during take-off: zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata, N=4) and diamond dove (Geopelia cuneata, N=3). We measured kinematics using high-speed video, aerodynamics using particle image velocimetry, and ground-reaction forces using a perch mounted on a force plate. In contrast with the first three wingbeats of take-off, the final four wingbeats during landing featured ~2 times greater force production. Thus, wings contribute proportionally more to changes in velocity during the last phase of landing compared with the initial phase of take-off. The two species touched down at the same velocity (~1 m s−1), but they exhibited significant differences in the timing of their final wingbeat relative to touchdown. The ratio of average wing force to peak leg force was greater in diamond doves than in zebra finches. Peak ground reaction forces during landing were ~50% of those during take-off, consistent with the birds being motivated to control landing. Likewise, estimations of mechanical energy flux for both species indicate that wings produce 3–10 times more mechanical work within the final wingbeats of flight compared with the kinetic energy of the body absorbed by legs during ground contact."},{"title":"Seasonal oscillation of liver-derived hibernation protein complex in the central nervous system of non-hibernating mammals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2667","abstract":"Mammalian hibernation elicits profound changes in whole-body physiology. The liver-derived hibernation protein (HP) complex, consisting of HP-20, HP-25 and HP-27, was shown to oscillate circannually, and this oscillation in the central nervous system (CNS) was suggested to play a role in hibernation. The HP complex has been found in hibernating chipmunks but not in related non-hibernating tree squirrels, leading to the suggestion that hibernation-specific genes may underlie the origin of hibernation. Here, we show that non-hibernating mammals express and regulate the conserved homologous HP complex in a seasonal manner, independent of hibernation. Comparative analyses of cow and chipmunk HPs revealed extensive biochemical and structural conservations. These include liver-specific expression, assembly of distinct heteromeric complexes that circulate in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and the striking seasonal oscillation of the HP levels in the blood and CNS. Central administration of recombinant HPs affected food intake in mice, without altering body temperature, physical activity levels or energy expenditure. Our results demonstrate that HP complex is not unique to the hibernators and suggest that the HP-regulated liver–brain circuit may couple seasonal changes in the environment to alterations in physiology."},{"title":"Chill coma temperatures appear similar along a latitudinal gradient, in contrast to divergent chill coma recovery times, in two widespread ant species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2650","abstract":"Populations of widely distributed ectotherms demonstrate different cold resistance corresponding to the local climate. However, efficiently thermoregulating ectotherms could avoid divergence in cold resistance. Two species of ants, previously shown to even out latitudinal differences of mean summer temperatures in their nests, were used to test this hypothesis by comparing the temperature dependence of cold resistance in three distant populations (from 50°, 60° and 67°N). The species differ in habitat preferences, one (Myrmica rubra) being less stenotopic than the other (M. ruginodis). Therefore, three different predictions were made about their cold resistance: along the latitudinal gradient, it might be similar within the two species (because of thermoregulation within nests/habitats) or similar only in M. rubra (as a result of thermoregulation among habitats), or divergent at least in M. rubra (no effect of thermoregulation). Among populations of both species, neither differences nor latitudinal trends in chill coma temperature were statistically significant after 11 months of standard conditions, with or without cold hardening. In contrast, recovery time significantly differed among populations in both species, although its latitudinal trends were strongly curvilinear: in M. rubra, the intermediate population tended towards the slowest recovery, and in M. ruginodis, it tended towards the fastest. After 22 months, the patterns remained the same, except that M. ruginodis showed a significant linear latitudinal trend in chill coma temperature (with no significant populational differences). Hence, thermoregulation, both within and among habitats, apparently does keep chill coma temperatures similar. Recovery rate demonstrates divergence, but its curvilinear trends suggest a connection with climates experienced by ancestral populations."},{"title":"Brightness discrimination in the day- and night-adapted wandering spider Cupiennius salei","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2704","abstract":"Cupiennius salei is a nocturnal spider with eight eyes, which undergo a remarkable circadian cycle: the rhabdomeric membrane of the photoreceptor cells is dismantled during the day and rebuilt at the beginning of the night. Such drastic changes might influence the brightness discrimination ability. We tested this hypothesis by presenting square-shaped flickering stimuli with certain luminances on stationary backgrounds with other luminances to spiders with day- or night-adapted eyes. When the spider, through its three pairs of so-called secondary eyes, perceives a visible contrast between the stimulus and the background, its principal eye muscle activity should increase. We therefore recorded this activity in vivo to assess the brightness discrimination ability of Cupiennius salei. Our results show that this spider has good brightness discrimination ability, which is significantly better with dark-adapted eyes. A Michelson contrast of 0.1 to 0.2 at night, and of 0.2 to 0.3 for day-adapted eyes, is sufficient to elicit a significant response, except below a critical value of luminance (~16 cd m−2), where the minimal perceivable contrast needs to be higher. In the Discussion we compare these performances with those of other animals, in particular with jumping spiders."},{"title":"Mitochondrial phenotypic flexibility enhances energy savings during winter fast in king penguin chicks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2691","abstract":"Energy conservation is a key priority for organisms that live in environments with seasonal shortages in resource supplies or that spontaneously fast during their annual cycle. The aim of this study was to determine whether the high fasting endurance of winter-acclimatized king penguin chicks (Aptenodytes patagonicus) is associated with an adjustment of mitochondrial bioenergetics in pectoralis muscle, the largest skeletal muscle in penguins. The rates of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and ATP synthesis and mitochondrial efficiency (ATP/O ratio) were measured in winter-acclimatized chicks. We used pyruvate/malate and palmitoyl-l-carnitine/malate as respiratory substrates and results from naturally fasted chicks were compared to experimentally re-fed chicks. Bioenergetics analysis of pectoralis muscle revealed that mitochondria are on average 15% more energy efficient in naturally fasted than in experimentally fed chicks, indicating that fasted birds consume less nutrients to sustain their energy-demanding processes. We also found that moderate reductions in temperature from 38°C to 30°C further increase by 23% the energy coupling efficiency at the level of mitochondria, suggesting that king penguin chicks realize additional energy savings while becoming hypothermic during winter. It has been calculated that this adjustment of mitochondrial efficiency in skeletal muscle may contribute to nearly 25% of fasting-induced reduction in mass-specific metabolic rate measured in vivo. The present study shows that the regulation of mitochondrial efficiency triggers the development of an economical management of resources, which would maximize the conservation of endogenous fuel stores by decreasing the cost of living in fasted winter-acclimatized king penguin chicks."},{"title":"Slow swimming, fast strikes: effects of feeding behavior on scaling of anaerobic metabolism in epipelagic squid","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2710","abstract":"Many pelagic fishes engage prey at high speeds supported by high metabolic rates and anaerobic metabolic capacity.

We hypothesized that activity of the anaerobically poised enzymes would be high and increase with size as in ecologically similar fishes. In contrast, we demonstrate that anaerobic metabolic capacity in these organisms scales negatively with body mass. We explored several cephalopod-specific traits, such as the use of tentacles to capture prey, body morphology and reduced relative prey size of adult squids, that may create a diminished reliance on anaerobically fueled burst activity during prey capture in large animals."},{"title":"Social status differences regulate the serotonergic system of a cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2680","abstract":"Serotonin (5-HT) inhibits aggression and modulates aspects of sexual behaviour in many species, but the mechanisms responsible are not well understood. Here, we exploited the social dominance hierarchy of Astatotilapia burtoni to understand the role of the serotonergic system in long-term maintenance of social status. We identified three populations of 5-HT cells in dorsal and ventral periventricular pretectal nuclei (PPd, PPv), the nucleus of the paraventricular organ (PVO) and raphe. Dominant males had more 5-HT cells than subordinates in the raphe, but the size of these cells did not differ between social groups. Subordinates had higher serotonergic turnover in the raphe and preoptic area (POA), a nucleus essential for hypothalamic-pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis function. The relative abundance of mRNAs for 5-HT receptor (5-HTR) subtypes 1A and 2A (htr1a, htr2a) was higher in subordinates, a difference restricted to the telencephalon. Because social status is tightly linked to reproductive capacity, we asked whether serotonin turnover and the expression of its receptors correlated with testes size and circulating levels of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT). We found negative correlations between both raphe and POA serotonin turnover and testes size, as well as between htr1a mRNA levels and circulating 11-KT. Thus, increased serotonin turnover in non-aggressive males is restricted to specific brain nuclei and is associated with increased expression of 5-HTR subtypes 1A and 2A exclusively in the telencephalon."},{"title":"The spectral transmission of non-salticid spider corneas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2698","abstract":"Although many salticid spiders have been shown to have corneas that transmit ultraviolet (UV) light, whether the corneas of non-salticid spiders transmit UV has not been previously investigated. In this study, we determined the spectral corneal transmission properties of 38 species belonging to 13 non-salticid families. We used these data to estimate the T50 transmission cut-off value, the wavelength corresponding to 50% maximal transmission for each species. The corneas of almost all species from the families Deinopidae, Lycosidae, Oxyopidae, Pisauridae, Sparassidae and Thomisidae, all of which have been reported to rely to a substantial extent on vision, transmitted short wavelength light below 400 nm, ranging from 306 to 381 nm. However, species from the families Atypidae and Ctenizidae are not known to rely substantially on vision, and the corneas of these species tended to absorb light of wavelengths below 380 nm, which may not allow UV sensitivity in these spiders. Liphistiidae, the family widely regarded as most basal among spiders, is of particular interest. The species in this family are not known to make substantial use of vision, and yet we found that liphistiid corneas transmitted UV light with a low T50 value (359 nm). T50 values of non-salticid spider corneas also varied with light habitat. Species living in dim environments tended to have UV-opaque corneas, but species inhabiting open areas had UV-transmitting corneas. However, there was no evidence of corneal transmission properties being related to whether a species is diurnal or nocturnal."},{"title":"The mechanics and behavior of cliff swallows during tandem flights","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2717","abstract":"Cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) are highly maneuverable social birds that often forage and fly in large open spaces. Here we used multi-camera videography to measure the three-dimensional kinematics of their natural flight maneuvers in the field. Specifically, we collected data on tandem flights, defined as two birds maneuvering together. These data permit us to evaluate several hypotheses on the high-speed maneuvering flight performance of birds. We found that high-speed turns are roll-based, but that the magnitude of the centripetal force created in typical maneuvers varied only slightly with flight speed, typically reaching a peak of ~2 body weights. Turning maneuvers typically involved active flapping rather than gliding. In tandem flights the following bird copied the flight path and wingbeat frequency (~12.3 Hz) of the lead bird while maintaining position slightly above the leader. The lead bird turned in a direction away from the lateral position of the following bird 65% of the time on average. Tandem flights vary widely in instantaneous speed (1.0 to 15.6 m s−1) and duration (0.72 to 4.71 s), and no single tracking strategy appeared to explain the course taken by the following bird."},{"title":"Effects of load magnitude, muscle length and velocity during eccentric chronic loading on the longitudinal growth of the vastus lateralis muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2726","abstract":"The present study investigated the longitudinal growth of the vastus lateralis muscle using four eccentric exercise protocols with different mechanical stimuli by modifying the load magnitude, lengthening velocity and muscle length at which the load was applied. Thirty-one participants voluntarily participated in this study in two experimental and one control group. The first experimental group (N=10) exercised the knee extensors of one leg at 65% (low load magnitude) of the maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MVC) and the second leg at 100% MVC (high load magnitude) with 90 deg s−1 angular velocity, from 25 to 100 deg knee angle. The second experimental group (N=10) exercised one leg at 100% MVC, 90 deg s−1, from 25 to 65 deg knee angle (short muscle length). The other leg was exercised at 100% MVC, 240 deg s−1 angular velocity (high muscle lengthening velocity) from 25 to 100 deg. In the pre- and post-intervention measurements, we examined the fascicle length of the vastus lateralis at rest and the moment–angle relationship of the knee extensors. After 10 weeks of intervention, we found a significant increase (~14%) of vastus lateralis fascicle length compared with the control group, yet only in the leg that was exercised with high lengthening velocity. The findings provide evidence that not every eccentric loading causes an increase in fascicle length and that the lengthening velocity of the fascicles during the eccentric loading, particularly in the phase where the knee joint moment decreases (i.e. deactivation of the muscle), seems to be an important factor for longitudinal muscle growth."},{"title":"The hydrodynamics of swimming at intermediate Reynolds numbers in the water boatman (Corixidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2740","abstract":"The fluid forces that govern propulsion determine the speed and energetic cost of swimming. These hydrodynamics are scale dependent and it is unclear what forces matter to the tremendous diversity of aquatic animals that are between a millimeter and a centimeter in length. Animals at this scale generally operate within the regime of intermediate Reynolds numbers, where both viscous and inertial fluid forces have the potential to play a role in propulsion. The present study aimed to resolve which forces create thrust and drag in the paddling of the water boatman (Corixidae), an animal that spans much of the intermediate regime (10<Re<200). By measuring the force generated by tethered water boatmen, we found that thrust is generated primarily by drag on the paddling appendages, with a negligible contribution from the acceleration reaction force. Based on these findings, we developed a forward-dynamic model of propulsion in free swimming that accurately predicted changes in the body's center of mass over time. For both tethered and free swimming, we used non-linear optimization algorithms to determine the force coefficients that best matched our measurements. With this approach, the drag coefficients on the body and paddle were found to be up to three times greater than on static structures in fully developed flow at the same Reynolds numbers. This is likely a partial consequence of unsteady interactions between the paddles or between the paddles and the body. In addition, the maximum values for these coefficients were inversely related to the Reynolds number, which suggests that viscous forces additionally play an important role in the hydrodynamics of small water boatmen. This understanding for the major forces that operate at intermediate Reynolds numbers offers a basis for interpreting the mechanics, energetics and functional morphology of swimming in many small aquatic animals."},{"title":"Parental experience of a risky environment leads to improved offspring growth rate","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2734","abstract":"Parasites (or diseases) are a major selective force for the evolution of life history traits and parasite–host evolution. Mothers can show a variety of responses to parasites during pregnancy, with different consequences for them or their offspring. However, whether information in the maternal environment before pregnancy can cause a change in the phenotype of the offspring is unknown. To avoid the confounding effect of pathogens and to reduce the risk of a direct effect of maternal immune system activation, we injected female laboratory mice with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) before they mated. In order to provide constant information on the potential infectious risk of the environment, females were mated with males that were also exposed to LPS before mating. Offspring from immune-challenged parents were larger and grew at a faster rate than offspring from control parents (injected with PBS). Additionally, offspring from immune-challenged parents that suffered the most from inflammation grew at a faster rate than offspring from low suffering parents. Producing heavier offspring that will reach sexual maturity earlier is likely to have fitness benefits for parents and offspring through improved reproductive success."},{"title":"Temperature-dependent variation in gas exchange patterns and spiracular control in Rhodnius prolixus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2752","abstract":"Insects display an array of respiratory behaviors, including the use of discontinuous gas exchange. This pattern is characterized by periods of spiracular closure, micro-openings (flutter), and complete openings during which the majority of gas exchange takes place. A current model of insect spiracular control suggests that spiracles are controlled by two interacting feedback loops, which produce the discontinuous pattern. The flutter period is thought to be initiated by a critically low partial pressure of oxygen, while the open period is initiated by a critically high CO2 threshold. The goal of our study was to test this control model under conditions of feeding-induced or temperature-induced changes in metabolic rate. We manipulated the metabolic rate of the insect Rhodnius prolixus using two discrete mechanisms: (1) feeding the insects a bloodmeal or (2) exposing them to a range of temperatures (18–38°C). Examining the variation in the gas exchange patterns produced by insects in each of these treatments allowed us to determine whether spiracular control is sensitive to metabolic rate and/or temperature. We found that increases in temperature caused significant decreases in open phase burst volumes and premature abandonment of discontinuous gas exchange cycles. These effects were not observed in fed individuals maintained at a single temperature despite their higher metabolic rates. Our results indicate that some part of the spiracular control mechanism is temperature sensitive, suggesting a possible role for pH in CO2 sensing."},{"title":"Role of oleoylethanolamide as a feeding regulator in goldfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2761","abstract":"Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is a bioactive lipid mediator, produced in the intestine and other tissues, which is involved in energy balance regulation in mammals, modulating feeding and lipid metabolism. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the presence and possible role of OEA in feeding regulation in goldfish (Carassius auratus). We assessed whether goldfish peripheral tissues and brain contain OEA and their regulation by nutritional status. OEA was detected in all studied tissues (liver, intestinal bulb, proximal intestine, muscle, hypothalamus, telencephalon and brainstem). Food deprivation (48 h) reduced intestinal OEA levels and levels increased upon re-feeding, suggesting that this compound may be involved in the short-term regulation of food intake in goldfish, as a satiety factor. Next, the effects of acute intraperitoneal administration of OEA on feeding, swimming and plasma levels of glucose and triglycerides were analysed. Food intake, swimming activity and circulating triglyceride levels were reduced by OEA 2 h post-injection. Finally, the possible interplay among OEA and other feeding regulators (leptin, cholecystokinin, ghrelin, neuropeptide Y, orexin and monoamines) was investigated. OEA actions on energy homeostasis in goldfish could be mediated, at least in part, through interactions with ghrelin and the serotonergic system, as OEA treatment reduced ghrelin expression in the intestinal bulb, and increased serotonergic activity in the telencephalon. In summary, our results indicate for the first time in fish that OEA could be involved in the regulation of feeding, swimming and lipid metabolism, suggesting a high conservation of OEA actions in energy balance throughout vertebrate evolution."},{"title":"Bees associate colour cues with differences in pollen rewards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2783","abstract":"In contrast to the wealth of knowledge concerning sucrose-rewarded learning, the question of whether bees learn when they collect pollen from flowers has been little addressed. The nutritional value of pollen varies considerably between species, and it may be that bees learn the features of flowers that produce pollen best suited to the dietary requirements of their larvae. It is still unknown, however, whether a non-ingestive reward pathway for pollen learning exists, and how foraging bees sense differences between pollen types. Here we adopt a novel experimental approach testing the learning ability of bees with pollen rewards. Bumblebees were reared under controlled laboratory conditions. To establish which pollen rewards are distinguishable, individual bees were given the choice of collecting two types of pollen, diluted to varying degrees with indigestible α-cellulose. Bees preferentially collected a particular pollen type, but this was not always the most concentrated sample. Preferences were influenced by the degree of similarity between samples and also by the period of exposure, with bees more readily collecting samples of lower pollen concentration after five trials. When trained differentially, bees were able to associate an initially less-preferred contextual colour with the more concentrated sample, whilst their pollen preferences did not change. Successful learning of contextual cues seems to maintain pollen foraging preferences over repeated exposures, suggesting that fast learning of floral cues may preclude continuous sampling and evaluation of alternative reward sources, leading to constancy in pollen foraging."},{"title":"Long-axis rotation: a missing degree of freedom in avian bipedal locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2770","abstract":"Ground-dwelling birds are typically characterized as erect bipeds having hind limbs that operate parasagittally. Consequently, most previous research has emphasized flexion/extension angles and moments as calculated from a lateral perspective. Three-dimensional (3D) motion analyses have documented non-planar limb movements, but the skeletal kinematics underlying changes in foot orientation and transverse position remain unclear. In particular, long-axis rotation of the proximal limb segments is extremely difficult to measure with topical markers. Here, we present six degree of freedom skeletal kinematic data from maneuvering guineafowl acquired by marker-based XROMM (X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology). Translations and rotations of the hips, knees, ankles and pelvis were derived from animated bone models using explicit joint coordinate systems. We distinguished sidesteps, sidestep yaws, crossover yaws, sidestep turns and crossover turns, but birds often performed a sequence of blended partial maneuvers. Long-axis rotation of the femur (up to 38 deg) modulated the foot's transverse position. Long-axis rotation of the tibiotarsus (up to 65 deg) also affected medio-lateral positioning, but primarily served to either re-orient a swing phase foot or yaw the body about a stance phase foot. Tarsometatarsal long-axis rotation was minimal, as was hip, knee and ankle abduction/adduction. Despite having superficially hinge-like joints, birds coordinate substantial long-axis rotations of the hips and knees to execute complex 3D maneuvers while striking a diversity of non-planar poses."},{"title":"Desiccation resistance reflects patterns of microhabitat choice in a Central American assemblage of wandering spiders","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2789","abstract":"The lowland rainforest of northeastern Costa Rica harbours an assemblage of large wandering spider species belonging to three habitat subguilds: (1) semi-aquatic, (2) forest ground dwelling and (3) vegetation dwelling. We hypothesized that desiccation resistance should differ among species preferring different microhabitats and the associated microclimate. Desiccation resistance was assessed by: (1) measuring water loss rates of the spiders under relatively dry experimental conditions, and (2) recording desiccation susceptibility, i.e. the reactions of the spiders to a relatively dry environment. High water loss rates and desiccation susceptibility of the semi-aquatic and forest-ground-dwelling subguilds clearly mirrored the relatively humid microclimate of the understory. Significantly lower water loss rates and desiccation susceptibility of the vegetation-dwelling species reflected the highly variable, often dry and hot conditions of the rainforest canopy and forest edge habitats. Vegetation-dwelling wandering spiders are therefore physiologically better adapted to dry conditions than the semi-aquatic and forest-ground-dwelling species. The results illustrate the significance of physiological characteristics for explaining both species-specific habitat use and, in a larger context, niche partitioning within a community."},{"title":"The relative roles of vision and chemosensation in mate recognition of Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2796","abstract":"Animals rely on sensory cues to classify objects in their environment and respond appropriately. However, the spatial structure of those sensory cues can greatly impact when, where and how they are perceived. In this study, we examined the relative roles of visual and chemosensory cues in the mate recognition behavior of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) using a robotic fly dummy that was programmed to interact with individual males. By pairing male flies with dummies of various shapes, sizes and speeds, or coated with different pheromones, we determined that visual and chemical cues play specific roles at different points in the courtship sequence. Vision is essential for determining whether to approach a moving object and initiate courtship, and males were more likely to begin chasing objects with the same approximate dimensions as another fly. However, whereas males were less likely to begin chasing larger dummies, once started, they would continue chasing for a similar length of time regardless of the dummy's shape. The presence of female pheromones on the moving dummy did not affect the probability that males would initiate a chase, but did influence how long they would continue chasing. Male pheromone both inhibits chase initiation and shortens chase duration. Collectively, these results suggest that male D. melanogaster use different sensory cues to progress through the courtship sequence: visual cues are dominant when deciding whether to approach an object whereas chemosensory cues determine how long the male pursues its target."},{"title":"The metabolic cost of human running: is swinging the arms worth it?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2456","abstract":"Although the mechanical function is quite clear, there is no consensus regarding the metabolic benefit of arm swing during human running. We compared the metabolic cost of running using normal arm swing with the metabolic cost of running while restricting the arms in three different ways: (1) holding the hands with the arms behind the back in a relaxed position (BACK), (2) holding the arms across the chest (CHEST) and (3) holding the hands on top of the head (HEAD). We hypothesized that running without arm swing would demand a greater metabolic cost than running with arm swing. Indeed, when compared with running using normal arm swing, we found that net metabolic power demand was 3, 9 and 13% greater for the BACK, CHEST and HEAD conditions, respectively (all P<0.05). We also found that when running without arm swing, subjects significantly increased the peak-to-peak amplitudes of both shoulder and pelvis rotation about the vertical axis, most likely a compensatory strategy to counterbalance the rotational angular momentum of the swinging legs. In conclusion, our findings support our general hypothesis that swinging the arms reduces the metabolic cost of human running. Our findings also demonstrate that arm swing minimizes torso rotation. We infer that actively swinging the arms provides both metabolic and biomechanical benefits during human running."},{"title":"Conditioned hearing sensitivity reduction in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/15/2806","abstract":"The conditioned change in hearing sensitivity during a warning sound preceding a loud sound was investigated in the bottlenose dolphin. Hearing sensitivity was measured using pip-train test stimuli and auditory evoked potential recording. When the test/warning stimulus with a frequency of 22.5 or 32 kHz preceded the loud sound with a frequency of 22.5 kHz and a sound pressure level of 165 dB re. 1 μPa rms, hearing thresholds before the loud sound increased relative to the baseline. The threshold increased up to 15 dB. In order to further investigate whether the observed threshold increase was due to conditioning, the dependence of the effect on warning duration and inter-trial interval was investigated. The duration of the warning substantially influenced the effect. Shorter warnings resulted in deeper suppression of responses and higher threshold increases than longer warnings. In contrast, the effect was nearly independent of the duration of the inter-trial interval, i.e. it was independent of the delay from the loud sound to the test/warning sound in the subsequent trial. These data are considered as evidence that the observed hearing threshold increases were not a result of the unconditioned effect of the loud sound and were instead a manifestation of a conditioned dampening of hearing when the bottlenose dolphin anticipated the quick appearance of a loud sound in the same way as previously demonstrated in the false killer whale."},{"title":"Null point of discrimination in crustacean polarisation vision","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2462","abstract":"The polarisation of light is used by many species of cephalopods and crustaceans to discriminate objects or to communicate. Most visual systems with this ability, such as that of the fiddler crab, include receptors with photopigments that are oriented horizontally and vertically relative to the outside world. Photoreceptors in such an orthogonal array are maximally sensitive to polarised light with the same fixed e-vector orientation. Using opponent neural connections, this two-channel system may produce a single value of polarisation contrast and, consequently, it may suffer from null points of discrimination. Stomatopod crustaceans use a different system for polarisation vision, comprising at least four types of polarisation-sensitive photoreceptor arranged at 0, 45, 90 and 135 deg relative to each other, in conjunction with extensive rotational eye movements. This anatomical arrangement should not suffer from equivalent null points of discrimination. To test whether these two systems were vulnerable to null points, we presented the fiddler crab Uca heteropleura and the stomatopod Haptosquilla trispinosa with polarised looming stimuli on a modified LCD monitor. The fiddler crab was less sensitive to differences in the degree of polarised light when the e-vector was at −45 deg than when the e-vector was horizontal. In comparison, stomatopods showed no difference in sensitivity between the two stimulus types. The results suggest that fiddler crabs suffer from a null point of sensitivity, while stomatopods do not."},{"title":"Gait-specific adaptation of locomotor activity in response to dietary restriction in Caenorhabditis elegans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2480","abstract":"Locomotion is crucial for the survival of living organisms, as it allows foraging, flight and mating behaviour. In response to environmental cues, many organisms switch between alternative forms of locomotion, referred to as gaits. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits two gaits: swimming in liquids and crawling on dense gels. The kinematics and patterns of muscle activity differ between the two gaits, with swimming being less efficient than crawling. We found that C. elegans when grown on dietary restriction (DR) plates and then tested immediately for swimming activity exhibit an accelerated frequency of body-bending swimming compared with ad libitum-fed worms, resulting in an increased swimming speed. This response is independent of the presence or absence of food bacteria in the assay liquid. In contrast, the crawling speed of DR worms on assay agar plates is decreased and influenced by food availability. Because DR also attenuates the disturbed swimming activity of worms that are deficient in the presynaptic dopamine transporter DAT-1, our data link DR-induced alterations of the swimming gait to synaptic processes. This strongly suggests a biochemical rather than a biomechanical response to DR provoked by changes in the worm's body structure. We conclude that the increase in locomotor activity in response to DR is specific to the swimming gait and might represent a survival strategy, allowing food-deprived nematodes to exit unfavourable environments."},{"title":"Rapid swimming and escape movements in the aquatic larvae and pupae of the phantom midge Chaoborus crystallinus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2468","abstract":"Rapid locomotion in the aquatic larvae and pupae of the phantom midge Chaoborus crystallinus was analysed. A 10-mm long larva moved sporadically by rapidly curling into a tight circle and then unfurling. The most common movement (70% of all movements) was a body rotation of 332±22 deg (mean ± s.d.) that lasted 63±19 ms and reached a peak velocity of 0.07±0.02 m s−1. If the head unfurled earlier in the cycle, the rotation was smaller and the larva dived downwards. A distinct category of single rotations of approximately 180 deg (8%) resulted in a larva finishing with its head pointing in the opposite direction. A sequence of rotational movements (22%) resulted in more extensive displacements. The area of the tail fan was reduced by folding during part of a cycle. It was made of a row of 26 radiating filaments with interlacing hairs between adjacent filaments and resilin at their ventral midline articulations with the body. The fan sprang back passively to its splayed position after being forcibly folded. Reducing the area of the fan by 80% decreased angular rotation and impaired stability so that 33% of movements ended with the body upside down. A 6 mm long pupa also moved by curling and unfurling motions of the head and tail that lasted 215±19 ms and generated slower velocities of 0.03±0.01 m s−1. The pupal tail fan was membranous, oriented differently, had resilin at its articulations and its area could be changed."},{"title":"A systems-level approach to understanding transcriptional regulation by p53 during mammalian hibernation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2489","abstract":"Presumably to conserve energy, many mammals enter into hibernation during the winter. Homeostatic processes such as transcription and translation are virtually arrested. To further elucidate transcriptional regulation during hibernation, we studied the transcription factor p53. Here, we demonstrate that changes in liver mRNA and protein concentrations of known regulators of p53 are consistent with activation. p53 mRNA and protein concentrations are unrelated. Importantly, p53 protein concentration is increased ~2-fold during the interbout arousal that punctuates bouts of torpor. As a result, both the interbout arousal and the torpid state are characterized by high levels of nuclear-localized p53. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that p53 binds DNA during the winter. Furthermore, p53 recruits RNA polymerase II, as indicated by nuclear run-on data. However, and consistent with previous data indicating an arrest of transcriptional elongation during torpor, p53 ‘activity’ does not result in expected changes in target gene transcripts. These data demonstrate the importance of using a systems level-approach in understanding a complex phenotype such as mammalian hibernation. Relying on interpretations of data that are based on steady-state regulation in other systems may be misleading in the context of non-steady-state conditions such as torpor."},{"title":"Multitasking in an eye: the unusual organization of the Thermonectus marmoratus principal larval eyes allows for far and near vision and might aid in depth perception","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2509","abstract":"Very few visual systems diverge fundamentally from the basic plans of well-studied animal eyes.

These eyes are characterized by complex layered distal and proximal retinas. We previously reported that their principal eye E2 has a bifocal lens, and previous behavioral experiments suggested that these larvae have a unilateral range-finding mechanism that may involve their bizarre eye organization. In the present study, we expanded our optical measurements and found that: (1) E1 also has a bifocal lens, (2) E1 is best suited for far vision while E2 is best suited for near vision and (3) throughout their typical hunting range, the positions of focused images shift across specific retinal layers. This anatomical and optical organization in principle could support unilateral range finding. Taken together, our findings outline an unusual visual mechanism that is likely to be essential for the extraordinary hunting ability of these larvae."},{"title":"Living in warmer, more acidic oceans retards physiological recovery from tidal emersion in the velvet swimming crab, Necora puber","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2499","abstract":"The distribution patterns of many species in the intertidal zone are partly determined by their ability to survive and recover from tidal emersion. During emersion, most crustaceans experience gill collapse, impairing gas exchange. Such collapse generates a state of hypoxemia and a hypercapnia-induced respiratory acidosis, leading to hyperlactaemia and metabolic acidosis. However, how such physiological responses to emersion are modified by prior exposure to elevated CO2 and temperature combinations, indicative of future climate change scenarios, is not known. We therefore investigated key physiological responses of velvet swimming crabs, Necora puber, kept for 14 days at one of four pCO2/temperature treatments (400 μatm/10°C, 1000 μatm/10°C, 400 μatm/15°C or 1000 μatm/15°C) to experimental emersion and recovery. Pre-exposure to elevated pCO2 and temperature increased pre-emersion bicarbonate ion concentrations [HCO3−], increasing resistance to short periods of emersion (90 min). However, there was still a significant acidosis following 180 min emersion in all treatments. The recovery of extracellular acid–base via the removal of extracellular pCO2 and lactate after emersion was significantly retarded by exposure to both elevated temperature and pCO2. If elevated environmental pCO2 and temperature lead to slower recovery after emersion, then some predominantly subtidal species that also inhabit the low to mid shore, such as N. puber, may have a reduced physiological capacity to retain their presence in the low intertidal zone, ultimately affecting their bathymetric range of distribution, as well as the structure and diversity of intertidal assemblages."},{"title":"Hearing capacities and otolith size in two ophidiiform species (Ophidion rochei and Carapus acus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2517","abstract":"Numerous studies have highlighted the diversity of fish inner ear morphology. However, the function of the shape, size and orientation of the different structures remains poorly understood. The saccule (otolithic endorgan) is considered to be the principal hearing organ in fishes and it has been hypothesized that sagitta (saccular otolith) shape and size affect hearing capacities: large sagittae are thought to increase sensitivity. The sagittae of many ophidiids and carapids occupy a large volume inside the neurocranium. Hence they are a good structure with which to test the size hypothesis. The main aim of this study was to investigate hearing capacities and inner ear morphology in two ophidiiform species: Ophidion rochei and Carapus acus. We used a multidisciplinary approach that combines dissections, μCT-scan examinations and auditory evoked potential techniques. Carapus acus and O. rochei sagittae have similar maximal diameters; both species have larger otoliths than many non-ophidiiform species, especially compared with the intra-neurocranium volume. Both species are sensitive to sounds up to 2100 Hz. Relative to the skull, O. rochei has smaller sagittae than the carapid, but better hearing capacities from 300 to 900 Hz and similar sensitivities at 150 Hz and from 1200 to 2100 Hz. Results show that hearing capacities of a fish species cannot be predicted only based on sagitta size. Larger otoliths (in size relative to the skull) may have evolved mainly for performing vestibular functions in fishes, especially those species that need to execute precise and complex movements."},{"title":"Directional vibration sensing in the termite Macrotermes natalensis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2526","abstract":"Although several behavioural studies demonstrate the ability of insects to localise the source of vibrations, it is still unclear how insects are able to perceive directional information from vibratory signals on solid substrates, because time-of-arrival and amplitude difference between receptory structures are thought to be too small to be processed by insect nervous systems. The termite Macrotermes natalensis communicates using vibrational drumming signals transmitted along subterranean galleries. When soldiers are attacked by predators, they tend to drum with their heads against the substrate and create a pulsed vibration. Workers respond by a fast retreat into the nest. Soldiers in the vicinity start to drum themselves, leading to an amplification and propagation of the signal. Here we show that M. natalensis makes use of a directional vibration sensing in the context of colony defence. In the field, soldiers are recruited towards the source of the signal. In arena experiments on natural nest material, soldiers are able to localise the source of vibration. Using two movable platforms allowing us to vibrate the legs of the left and right sides of the body with a time delay, we show that the difference in time-of-arrival is the directional cue used for orientation. Delays as short as 0.2 ms are sufficient to be detected.

Previous work in midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) has shown that BK expression correlates with seasonal changes in hearing sensitivity and that pharmacologically blocking these channels replicates the natural decreases in sensitivity during the winter non-reproductive season. To test the hypothesis that reducing BK channel function is sufficient to change auditory thresholds in fish, morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) were used in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) to alter expression of slo1a and slo1b, duplicate genes coding for the pore-forming α-subunits of BK channels. Following MO injection, microphonic potentials were recorded from the inner ear of larvae. Quantitative real-time PCR was then used to determine the MO effect on slo1a and slo1b expression in these same fish. Knockdown of either slo1a or slo1b resulted in disrupted gene expression and increased auditory thresholds across the same range of frequencies of natural auditory plasticity observed in midshipman. We conclude that interference with the normal expression of individual slo1 genes is sufficient to increase auditory thresholds in zebrafish larvae and that changes in BK channel expression are a direct mechanism for regulation of peripheral hearing sensitivity among fishes."},{"title":"Ant–fungus species combinations engineer physiological activity of fungus gardens","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2540","abstract":"Fungus-gardening insects are among the most complex organisms because of their extensive co-evolutionary histories with obligate fungal symbionts and other microbes. Some fungus-gardening insect lineages share fungal symbionts with other members of their lineage and thus exhibit diffuse co-evolutionary relationships, while others exhibit little or no symbiont sharing, resulting in host–fungus fidelity. The mechanisms that maintain this symbiont fidelity are currently unknown. Prior work suggested that derived leaf-cutting ants in the genus Atta interact synergistically with leaf-cutter fungi (Attamyces) by exhibiting higher fungal growth rates and enzymatic activities than when growing a fungus from the sister-clade to Attamyces (so-called ‘Trachymyces’), grown primarily by the non-leaf cutting Trachymyrmex ants that form, correspondingly, the sister-clade to leaf-cutting ants. To elucidate the enzymatic bases of host–fungus specialization in leaf-cutting ants, we conducted a reciprocal fungus-switch experiment between the ant Atta texana and the ant Trachymyrmex arizonensis and report measured enzymatic activities of switched and sham-switched fungus gardens to digest starch, pectin, xylan, cellulose and casein. Gardens exhibited higher amylase and pectinase activities when A. texana ants cultivated Attamyces compared with Trachymyces fungi, consistent with enzymatic specialization. In contrast, gardens showed comparable amylase and pectinase activities when T. arizonensis cultivated either fungal species. Although gardens of leaf-cutting ants are not known to be significant metabolizers of cellulose, T. arizonensis were able to maintain gardens with significant cellulase activity when growing either fungal species. In contrast to carbohydrate metabolism, protease activity was significantly higher in Attamyces than in Trachymyces, regardless of the ant host. Activity of some enzymes employed by this symbiosis therefore arises from complex interactions between the ant host and the fungal symbiont."},{"title":"Attachment to challenging substrates – fouling, roughness and limits of adhesion in the northern clingfish (Gobiesox maeandricus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2548","abstract":"Northern clingfish use a ventral suction disc to stick to rough substrates in the intertidal zone. Bacteria, algae and invertebrates grow on these surfaces (fouling) and change the surface properties of the primary substrate, and therefore the attachment conditions for benthic organisms. In this study, we investigate the influence of fouling and surface roughness on the adhesive strength of northern clingfish, Gobiesox maeandricus. We measured clingfish tenacity on unfouled and fouled substrates over four surface roughnesses. We exposed surfaces for 6 weeks in the Pacific Ocean, until they were covered with periphyton. Clingfish tenacity is equivalent on both fouled and unfouled smooth substrates; however, tenacity on fouled rough surfaces is less compared with tenacity on unfouled ones. We hypothesize that parts of biofilm may act as a lubricant and decrease friction of the disc margin, thereby making disc margins slip inwards and fail at lower tenacities. Nevertheless, even on fouled surfaces the adhesive forces are approximately 150 times the body weight of the fish. To identify the upper threshold of surface roughness the fish can cling to, we tested seven unfouled substrates of increasing surface roughness. The threshold roughness at which northern clingfish failed increased with specimen size. We hypothesize that because of the elastic properties of the disc margin, a larger disc can adapt to larger surface irregularities. The largest specimens (length 10–12 cm) were able to cling to surfaces with 2–4 mm grain size. The fish can attach to surfaces with roughness between 2 and 9% of the suction disc width."},{"title":"Metabolic suppression during protracted exposure to hypoxia in the jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas, living in an oxygen minimum zone","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2555","abstract":"The jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas, can survive extended forays into the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced oxygen consumption and a limited anaerobic contribution to ATP production, suggesting the capacity for substantial metabolic suppression during hypoxic exposure. Here, we provide a more complete description of energy metabolism and explore the expression of proteins indicative of transcriptional and translational arrest that may contribute to metabolic suppression. We demonstrate a suppression of total ATP demand under hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen, PO2=0.8 kPa) in both juveniles (52%) and adults (35%) of the jumbo squid. Oxygen consumption rates are reduced to 20% under hypoxia relative to air-saturated controls. Concentrations of arginine phosphate (Arg-P) and ATP declined initially, reaching a new steady state (~30% of controls) after the first hour of hypoxic exposure. Octopine began accumulating after the first hour of hypoxic exposure, once Arg-P breakdown resulted in sufficient free arginine for substrate. Octopine reached levels near 30 mmol g−1 after 3.4 h of hypoxic exposure. Succinate did increase through hypoxia but contributed minimally to total ATP production. Glycogenolysis in mantle muscle presumably serves to maintain muscle functionality and balance energetics during hypoxia. We provide evidence that post-translational modifications on histone proteins and translation factors serve as a primary means of energy conservation and that select components of the stress response are altered in hypoxic squids. Reduced ATP consumption under hypoxia serves to maintain ATP levels, prolong fuel store use and minimize the accumulation of acidic intermediates of anaerobic ATP-generating pathways during prolonged diel forays into the OMZ. Metabolic suppression likely limits active, daytime foraging at depth in the core of the OMZ, but confers an energetic advantage over competitors that must remain in warm, oxygenated surface waters. Moreover, the capacity for metabolic suppression provides habitat flexibility as OMZs expand as a result of climate change."},{"title":"Circadian rhythms are not involved in the regulation of circannual reproductive cycles in a sub-tropical bird, the spotted munia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2569","abstract":"Circannual rhythms regulate seasonal reproduction in many vertebrates. The present study investigated whether circannual reproductive phenotypes (rhythms in growth of gonads and molt) were generated independently of the circadian clocks in the subtropical non-photoperiodic spotted munia (Lonchura punctulata). Birds were subjected to light:dark (LD) cycles with identical light but varying dark hours, such that the period of LD cycle (T) equaled 16 h (T16; 12 h L:4 h D), 21 h (T21; 12 h L:9 h D), 24 h (T24; 12 h L:12 h D) and 27 h (T27; 12 h L:15 h D), or to continuous light (LL, 24 h L:0 h D) at ~18°C. During the ~21 month exposure, munia underwent at least two cycles of gonadal development and molt; changes in body mass were not rhythmic. This was similar to the occurrence of annual cycles in reproduction and molt observed in wild birds. A greater asynchrony between circannual cycles of gonad development and molt indicated their independent regulation. Females showed reproductive rhythms with similar circannual periods, whilst in males, circannual periods measured between peak gonadal size were longer in T21 and T24 than in T16 or T27. This suggested a sex-dependent timing of annual reproduction in the spotted munia. Also, food availability periods may not influence the circannual timing of reproduction, as shown by the results on the rhythm in gonadal growth and regression in munia under T-photocycles and LL that provided differential light (feeding) hours. Further, a short-term experiment revealed that activity–rest patterns in munia were synchronized with T-photocycles, but were arrhythmic under LL. We conclude that circadian rhythms are not involved in the timing of the annual reproductive cycle in the spotted munia."},{"title":"Jumping mechanisms in flatid planthoppers (Hemiptera, Flatidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2590","abstract":"The jumping performance of three species of hemipterans from Australia and Europe belonging to the family Flatidae was analysed from images captured at a rate of 5000 s−1. The shape of a flatid was dominated by large triangular or wedge-shaped front wings, which, when folded, covered and extended above and behind the body to give a laterally compressed and possibly streamlined appearance. The body lengths of the three species of adults ranged from 7 to 9 mm and their mass from 8 to 19 mg. The propulsive hind legs were 30% longer than the front legs but only 36–54% of the body length. Jumps with the fastest take-off velocities of 2.8–3.2 m s−1 had acceleration times of 1.4–1.8 ms. During such jumps, adults experienced an acceleration of 174–200 g. These jumps required an energy expenditure of 76–225 μJ, a power output of 13–60 mW and exerted a force of 9–37 mN. The required power output per mass of jumping muscle in adults ranged from 24,000 to 27,000 W kg−1 muscle, 100 times greater than the maximum active contractile limit of normal muscle. The free-living nymphs were also proficient jumpers, reaching take-off velocities of 2.2 m s−1. To achieve such a jumping performance requires a power amplification mechanism. The energy store for such a mechanism was identified as the internal skeleton linking a hind coxa to the articulation of a hind wing. These pleural arches fluoresced bright blue when illuminated with UV light, indicating the presence of the elastic protein resilin. The energy generated by the prolonged contractions of the trochanteral depressor muscles was stored in distortions of these structures, and the rapid elastic recoil of these muscles powered the synchronous propulsive movements of the hind legs."},{"title":"Ontogenetic investigation of underwater hearing capabilities in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) using a dual testing approach","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2580","abstract":"Sea turtles reside in different acoustic environments with each life history stage and may have different hearing capacity throughout ontogeny. For this study, two independent yet complementary techniques for hearing assessment, i.e. behavioral and electrophysiological audiometry, were employed to (1) measure hearing in post-hatchling and juvenile loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta (19–62 cm straight carapace length) to determine whether these migratory turtles exhibit an ontogenetic shift in underwater auditory detection and (2) evaluate whether hearing frequency range and threshold sensitivity are consistent in behavioral and electrophysiological tests. Behavioral trials first required training turtles to respond to known frequencies, a multi-stage, time-intensive process, and then recording their behavior when they were presented with sound stimuli from an underwater speaker using a two-response forced-choice paradigm. Electrophysiological experiments involved submerging restrained, fully conscious turtles just below the air–water interface and recording auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) when sound stimuli were presented using an underwater speaker. No significant differences in behavior-derived auditory thresholds or AEP-derived auditory thresholds were detected between post-hatchling and juvenile sea turtles. While hearing frequency range (50–1000/1100 Hz) and highest sensitivity (100–400 Hz) were consistent in audiograms pooled by size class for both behavior and AEP experiments, both post-hatchlings and juveniles had significantly higher AEP-derived than behavior-derived auditory thresholds, indicating that behavioral assessment is a more sensitive testing approach. The results from this study suggest that post-hatchling and juvenile loggerhead sea turtles are low-frequency specialists, exhibiting little differences in threshold sensitivity and frequency bandwidth despite residence in acoustically distinct environments throughout ontogeny."},{"title":"Chronic stress alters concentrations of corticosterone receptors in a tissue-specific manner in wild house sparrows (Passer domesticus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2601","abstract":"The physiological stress response results in release of glucocorticoid hormones such as corticosterone (CORT). Whereas short-term activation of this response helps animals cope with environmental stressors, chronic activation can result in negative effects including metabolic dysregulation and reproductive failure. However, there is no consensus hormonal profile of a chronically stressed animal, suggesting that researchers may need to look beyond hormone titers to interpret the impacts of chronic stress. In this study, we brought wild house sparrows (Passer domesticus) into captivity. We then compared glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor concentrations in sparrows exposed either to a standardized chronic stress protocol (n=26) or to standard husbandry conditions (controls; n=20). We used radioligand binding assays to quantify receptors in whole brain, liver, kidneys, spleen, gonads, gastrocnemius and pectoralis muscle, omental and subcutaneous fat, and bib and back skin. In most tissues, CORT receptors did not differ between controls and stressed animals, although we found marginal increases in receptor density in kidney and testes in stressed birds at some time points. Only in pectoralis muscle was there a robust effect of chronic stress, with both receptor types higher in stressed animals. Increased pectoralis sensitivity to CORT with chronic stress may be part of the underlying mechanism for muscle wasting in animals administered exogenous CORT. Furthermore, the change in pectoralis was not paralleled by gastrocnemius receptors. This difference may help explain previous reports of a greater effect of CORT on pectoralis than on other muscle types, and indicate that birds use this muscle as a protein reserve."},{"title":"Variation in body condition during the post-moult foraging trip of southern elephant seals and its consequences on diving behaviour","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/14/2609","abstract":"Mature female southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) come ashore only in October to breed and in January to moult, spending the rest of the year foraging at sea. Mature females may lose as much as 50% of their body mass, mostly in lipid stores, during the breeding season due to fasting and lactation. When departing to sea, post-breeding females are negatively buoyant, and the relative change in body condition (i.e. density) during the foraging trip has previously been assessed by monitoring the descent rate during drift dives. However, relatively few drift dives are performed, resulting in low resolution of the temporal reconstruction of body condition change. In this study, six post-breeding females were equipped with time–depth recorders and accelerometers to investigate whether changes in active swimming effort and speed could be used as an alternative method of monitoring density variations throughout the foraging trip. In addition, we assessed the consequences of density change on the swimming efforts of individuals while diving and investigated the effects on dive duration. Both descent swimming speed and ascent swimming effort were found to be strongly correlated to descent rate during drift dives, enabling the fine-scale monitoring of seal density change over the whole trip. Negatively buoyant seals minimized swimming effort during descents, gliding down at slower speeds, and reduced their ascent swimming effort to maintain a nearly constant swimming speed as their buoyancy increased. One per cent of seal density variation over time was found to induce a 20% variation in swimming effort during dives with direct consequences on dive duration."},{"title":"Sedentary behavior as a factor in determining lateral line contributions to rheotaxis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2338","abstract":"Rheotaxis is a robust, multisensory behavior with many potential benefits for fish and other aquatic animals. Visual (optic flow) cues appear to be sufficient for rheotaxis, but other sensory cues can clearly compensate for the loss of vision. The role of various non-visual sensory systems, in particular the flow-sensing lateral line, is poorly understood, largely because of widely varying methods and sensory conditions for studying rheotaxis. Here, we examine how sedentary behavior under visually deprived conditions affects the relative importance of lateral line cues in two species: one that is normally sedentary (the three-lined corydoras, Corydoras trilineatus) and one that normally swims continuously along the substrate (the blind cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus). No effect of lateral line disruption on rheotactic performance was found in blind cavefish, which were significantly more mobile than three-lined corydoras. By contrast, rheotaxis was significantly impaired at low, but not high, flow speeds in lateral-line-disabled corydoras. In addition, lateral-line-enabled corydoras were characterized by decreased mobility and increased rheotactic performance relative to lateral-line-disabled fish. Taken together, these results suggest that sedentary behavior is an important factor in promoting reliance on lateral line cues."},{"title":"Phase shifts in binaural stimuli provide directional cues for sound localisation in the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2390","abstract":"The cricket's auditory system is a highly directional pressure difference receiver whose function is hypothesised to depend on phase relationships between the sound waves propagating through the auditory trachea that connects the left and right hearing organs. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the effect of experimentally constructed phase shifts in acoustic stimuli on phonotactic behavior of Gryllus bimaculatus, the oscillatory response patterns of the tympanic membrane, and the activity of the auditory afferents. The same artificial calling song was played simultaneously at the left and right sides of the cricket, but one sound pattern was shifted in phase by 90 deg (carrier frequencies between 3.6 and 5.4 kHz). All three levels of auditory processing are sensitive to experimentally induced acoustic phase shifts, and the response characteristics are dependent on the carrier frequency of the sound stimulus. At lower frequencies, crickets steered away from the sound leading in phase, while tympanic membrane vibrations and auditory afferent responses were smaller when the ipsilateral sound was leading. In contrast, opposite responses were observed at higher frequencies in all three levels of auditory processing. Minimal responses occurred near the carrier frequency of the cricket's calling song, suggesting a stability at this frequency. Our results indicate that crickets may use directional cues arising from phase shifts in acoustic signals for sound localisation, and that the response properties of pressure difference receivers may be analysed with phase-shifted sound stimuli to further our understanding of how insect auditory systems are adapted for directional processing."},{"title":"Could thermal sensitivity of mitochondria determine species distribution in a changing climate?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2348","abstract":"For many aquatic species, the upper thermal limit (Tmax) and the heart failure temperature (THF) are only a few degrees away from the species' current environmental temperatures. While the mechanisms mediating temperature-induced heart failure (HF) remain unresolved, energy flow and/or oxygen supply disruptions to cardiac mitochondria may be impacted by heat stress. Recent work using a New Zealand wrasse (Notolabrus celidotus) found that ATP synthesis capacity of cardiac mitochondria collapses prior to THF. However, whether this effect is limited to one species from one thermal habitat remains unknown. The present study confirmed that cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to heat stress-induced HF in two additional wrasses that occupy cold temperate (Notolabrus fucicola) and tropical (Thalassoma lunare) habitats. With exposure to heat stress, T. lunare had the least scope to maintain heart function with increasing temperature. Heat-exposed fish of all species showed elevated plasma succinate, and the heart mitochondria from the cold temperate N. fucicola showed decreased phosphorylation efficiencies (depressed respiratory control ratio, RCR), cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) flux and electron transport system (ETS) flux. In situ assays conducted across a range of temperatures using naive tissues showed depressed complex II (CII) and CCO capacity, limited ETS reserve capacities and lowered efficiencies of pyruvate uptake in T. lunare and N. celidotus. Notably, alterations of mitochondrial function were detectable at saturating oxygen levels, indicating that cardiac mitochondrial insufficiency can occur prior to HF without oxygen limitation. Our data support the view that species distribution may be related to the thermal limits of mitochondrial stability and function, which will be important as oceans continue to warm."},{"title":"Feather corticosterone reveals developmental stress in seabirds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2371","abstract":"In nest-bound avian offspring, food shortages typically trigger a release of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT). Recent studies indicate that CORT is passively deposited in the tissue of growing feathers and thus may provide an integrated measure of stress incurred during development in the nest. The current hypothesis predicts that, assuming a constant rate of feather growth, elevated CORT circulating in the blood corresponds to higher levels of CORT in feather tissue, but experimental evidence for nutritionally stressed chicks is lacking. Here, we examined how food limitation affects feather CORT content in the rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca moncerata). We (i) used captive chicks reared on control versus restricted diets, and (ii) applied this technique to free-living chicks with unknown nutritional histories that fledged at three separate colonies. We found that (i) feather growth was not affected by experimentally induced nutritional stress; (ii) captive chicks raised on a restricted diet had higher levels of CORT in their primary feathers; (iii) feather CORT deposition is a sensitive method of detecting nutritional stress; and (iv) free-living fledglings from the colony with poor reproductive performance had higher CORT in their primary feathers. We conclude that feather CORT is a sensitive integrated measure revealing the temporal dynamics of food limitations experienced by rhinoceros auklet nestlings. The use of feather CORT may be a powerful endocrine tool in ecological and evolutionary studies of bird species with similar preferential allocation of limited resources to feather development."},{"title":"Reproductive status, endocrine physiology and chemical signaling in the Neotropical, swarm-founding eusocial wasp Polybia micans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2399","abstract":"In the evolution of caste-based societies in Hymenoptera, the classical insect hormones juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids were co-opted into new functions. Social wasps, which show all levels of sociality and lifestyles, are an ideal group in which to study such functional changes. Virtually all studies on the physiological mechanisms underlying reproductive division of labor and caste functions in wasps have been done on independent-founding paper wasps, and the majority of these studies have focused on species specially adapted for overwintering. The relatively little-studied tropical swarm-founding wasps of the Epiponini (Vespidae) are a diverse group of permanently social wasps, with some species maintaining caste flexibility well into the adult phase. We investigated the behavior, reproductive status, JH and ecdysteroid titers in hemolymph, ecdysteroid content of the ovary and cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles in the caste-monomorphic, epiponine wasp Polybia micans Ducke. We found that the JH titer was not elevated in competing queens from established multiple-queen nests, but increased in lone queens that lack direct competition. In queenless colonies, JH titer rose transiently in young potential reproductives upon challenge by nestmates, suggesting that JH may prime the ovaries for further development. Ovarian ecdysteroids were very low in workers but higher and correlated with the number of vitellogenic oocytes in the queens. Hemolymph ecdysteroid levels were low and variable in both workers and queens. Profiles of P. micans CHCs reflected caste, age and reproductive status, but were not tightly linked to either hormone. These findings show a significant divergence in hormone function in swarm-founding wasps compared with independently founding ones."},{"title":"Level locomotion in wood ants: evidence for grounded running","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2358","abstract":"In order to better understand the strategies of locomotion in small insects, we have studied continuous level locomotion of the wood ant species Formica polyctena. We determined the three-dimensional centre of mass kinematics during the gait cycle and recorded the ground reaction forces of single legs utilising a self-developed test site. Our findings show that the animals used the same gait dynamics across a wide speed range without dissolving the tripodal stride pattern. To achieve higher velocities, the ants proportionally increased stride length and stepping frequency. The centre of mass energetics indicated a bouncing gait, in which horizontal kinetic and gravitational potential energy fluctuated in close phase. We determined a high degree of compliance especially in the front legs, as the effective leg length was nearly halved during the contact phase. This leads to only small vertical oscillations of the body, which are important in maintaining ground contact. Bouncing gaits without aerial phases seem to be a common strategy in small runners and can be sufficiently described by the bipedal spring-loaded inverted pendulum model. Thus, with our results, we provide evidence that wood ants perform ‘grounded running’."},{"title":"Novel underwater soundscape: acoustic repertoire of plainfin midshipman fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2377","abstract":"Toadfishes are among the best-known groups of sound-producing (vocal) fishes and include species commonly known as toadfish and midshipman. Although midshipman have been the subject of extensive investigation of the neural mechanisms of vocalization, this is the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of the spectro-temporal characters of their acoustic signals and one of the few for fishes in general. Field recordings of territorial, nest-guarding male midshipman during the breeding season identified a diverse vocal repertoire composed of three basic sound types that varied widely in duration, harmonic structure and degree of amplitude modulation (AM): ‘hum’, ‘grunt’ and ‘growl’. Hum duration varied nearly 1000-fold, lasting for minutes at a time, with stable harmonic stacks and little envelope modulation throughout the sound. By contrast, grunts were brief, ~30–140 ms, broadband signals produced both in isolation and repetitively as a train of up to 200 at intervals of ~0.5–1.0 s. Growls were also produced alone or repetitively, but at variable intervals of the order of seconds with durations between those of grunts and hums, ranging 60-fold from ~200 ms to 12 s. Growls exhibited prominent harmonics with sudden shifts in pulse repetition rate and highly variable AM patterns, unlike the nearly constant AM of grunt trains and flat envelope of hums. Behavioral and neurophysiological studies support the hypothesis that each sound type's unique acoustic signature contributes to signal recognition mechanisms. Nocturnal production of these sounds against a background chorus dominated constantly for hours by a single sound type, the multi-harmonic hum, reveals a novel underwater soundscape for fish."},{"title":"Reduced consumption of protein-rich foods follows immune challenge in a polyphagous caterpillar","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2250","abstract":"Advances in ecological immunity have illustrated that, like vertebrates, insects exhibit adaptive immunity, including induced changes in feeding behavior that aid the immune system. In particular, recent studies have pointed to the importance of protein intake in mounting an immune response. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the polyphagous caterpillar Grammia incorrupta (H. Edwards) (Family: Erebidae) would adaptively change its feeding behavior in response to immune challenge, predicting that caterpillars would increase their intake of dietary protein. We further predicted that this response would enhance the melanization response, a component of the immune system that acts against parasitoids. We challenged the immune system using either tachinid fly parasitoids or a bead injection technique that has been used in studies to simulate parasitism, and measured feeding before and after immune challenge on diets varying in their macronutrient content. To evaluate the effects of diet on melanization, we quantified melanization of beads following feeding assays. Contrary to our prediction, we found that parasitized or injected caterpillars given a choice between high- and low-protein foods reduced their intake of the high-protein food. Furthermore, in a no-choice experiment, caterpillars offered food with a protein concentration that is optimal for growth reduced feeding following immune challenge, whereas those offered a low-protein food did not. Although variation in protein intake did not change the caterpillars' melanization response, increased carbohydrate intake did increase melanization, suggesting a prophylactic role for carbohydrates. We discuss alternative mechanisms by which variation in protein intake could negatively or positively affect parasitized caterpillars, including nutritional interactions with the caterpillar's self-medication response."},{"title":"Rainbow trout provide the first experimental evidence for adherence to a distinct Strouhal number during animal oscillatory propulsion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2244","abstract":"The relationship between tail (or wing) beat frequency (ftail), amplitude (A) and forward velocity (U) in animals using oscillatory propulsion, when moving at a constant cruising speed, converges upon an optimum range of the Strouhal number (St=ftail·A/U). Previous work, based on observational data and supported by theory, shows St falling within the broad optimum range (0.2<St<0.4) and considers this adequate to indicate its importance in governing wing or tail kinematics. This study presents the first evidence using an experimental manipulation that supports the importance of maintaining kinematics at a single optimum (or preferred) St. The tail beat kinematics of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were disturbed by increasing water temperature (Twater) from 11±1 to 20±1°C. Elevated Twater increased ftail and decreased A, whilst St at any given U was conserved. St increased with U, driven by concomitant increases in A, whilst ftail was unaffected by U. An increase in Twater also increased basal metabolic costs, but did not affect the incremental increase in metabolic cost with increasing U. Predicted future changes to Twater of lakes and rivers (5–10°C over the next 100 years) may not present major locomotory problems to salmonids."},{"title":"Is there metabolic cold adaptation in terrestrial ectotherms? Exploring latitudinal compensation in the invasive snail Cornu aspersum","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2261","abstract":"Lower temperatures, extreme seasonality and shorter growing seasons at higher latitudes are expected to cause a decline in metabolic rates and annual growth rates of ectotherms. If a reduction in the rates of these biological processes involves a reduction in fitness, then organisms may evolve compensatory responses for the constraints imposed by high-latitude habitats. To test the existence of a latitudinal compensation in ectotherms, we used a common-garden experiment to investigate the extent to which the level of energy turnover (measured as standard metabolic rate, SMR) and the energy budget (energy allocation to growth) are affected by climatic constraints in three populations of the land snail Cornu aspersum, distributed across a latitudinal gradient of 1300 km in Chile. Our results did not support the existence of a latitudinal compensation in metabolic rates (metabolic cold adaptation). However, there was a countergradient variation (CnGV) for growth rate in which the highest latitudinal population exhibited greater growth rates than their counterparts from lower latitudes. Surprisingly, this CnGV pattern was accompanied by a lower apparent dry-matter digestibility, which could highlight a differential assimilation of ingested nutrients into somatic tissue, revealing enhanced growth efficiency in snails from the highest latitudinal habitat. Our evidence highlights that adjustments in energy allocation to the digestive machinery and to protein storage could act as a latitudinal compensation for enhanced growth efficiency in snails from the highest latitudinal population."},{"title":"Energy metabolism and regeneration are impaired by seawater acidification in the infaunal brittlestar Amphiura filiformis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2411","abstract":"Seawater acidification due to anthropogenic release of CO2 as well as the potential leakage of pure CO2 from sub-seabed carbon capture storage (CCS) sites may impose a serious threat to marine organisms. Although infaunal organisms can be expected to be particularly impacted by decreases in seawater pH, as a result of naturally acidified conditions in benthic habitats, information regarding physiological and behavioral responses is still scarce. Determination of PO2 and PCO2 gradients within burrows of the brittlestar Amphiura filiformis during environmental hypercapnia demonstrated that besides hypoxic conditions, increases of environmental PCO2 are additive to the already high PCO2 (up to 0.08 kPa) within the burrows. In response to up to 4 weeks exposure to pH 7.3 (0.3 kPa PCO2) and pH 7.0 (0.6 kPa PCO2), metabolic rates of A. filiformis were significantly reduced in pH 7.0 treatments, accompanied by increased ammonium excretion rates. Gene expression analyses demonstrated significant reductions of acid–base (NBCe and AQP9) and metabolic (G6PDH, LDH) genes. Determination of extracellular acid–base status indicated an uncompensated acidosis in CO2-treated animals, which could explain the depressed metabolic rates. Metabolic depression is associated with a retraction of filter feeding arms into sediment burrows. Regeneration of lost arm tissues following traumatic amputation is associated with significant increases in metabolic rate, and hypercapnic conditions (pH 7.0, 0.6 kPa) dramatically reduce the metabolic scope for regeneration, reflected in an 80% reduction in regeneration rate. Thus, the present work demonstrates that elevated seawater PCO2 significantly affects the environment and the physiology of infaunal organisms like A. filiformis."},{"title":"Diurnal dung beetles use the intensity gradient and the polarization pattern of the sky for orientation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2422","abstract":"To escape competition at the dung pile, a ball-rolling dung beetle forms a piece of dung into a ball and rolls it away.

Moreover, we show the first evidence of an insect using the celestial light-intensity gradient for orientation. Using a polarizer, we manipulated skylight so that the polarization pattern appeared to turn by 90 deg. The beetles then changed their bearing close to the expected 90 deg. This behavior was abolished if the sun was visible to the beetle, suggesting that polarized light is hierarchically subordinate to the sun. When the sky was depolarized and the sun was invisible, the beetles could still move along straight paths. Therefore, we analyzed the use of the celestial light-intensity gradient for orientation. Artificial rotation of the intensity pattern by 180 deg caused beetles to orient in the opposite direction. This light-intensity cue was also found to be subordinate to the sun and could play a role in disambiguating the polarization signal, especially at low sun elevations."},{"title":"Growth hormone transgenesis and polyploidy increase metabolic rate, alter the cardiorespiratory response and influence HSP expression in response to acute hypoxia in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) yolk-sac alevins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2268","abstract":"Growth hormone (GH)-transgenic Atlantic salmon display accelerated growth rates compared with non-transgenics. GH-transgenic fish also display cardiorespiratory and metabolic modifications that accompany the increased growth rate. An elevated routine metabolic rate has been described for pre- and post-smolt GH-transgenic salmon that also display improvements in oxygen delivery to support the increased aerobic demand. The early ontogenic effects of GH transgenesis on the respiratory and cellular physiology of fish, especially during adverse environmental conditions, and the effect of polyploidy are unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of GH transgenesis and polyploidy on metabolic, heart and ventilation rates and heat shock protein (HSP) levels after exposure to acute hypoxia in post-hatch Atlantic salmon yolk-sac alevins. Metabolic rate decreased with decreasing partial pressures of oxygen in all genotypes. In normoxia, triploid transgenics displayed the highest mass-specific metabolic rates in comparison to diploid transgenics and non-transgenic triploids, which, in contrast, had higher rates than diploid non-transgenics. In hypoxia, we observed a lower mass-specific metabolic rate in diploid non-transgenics compared with all other genotypes. However, no evidence for improved O2 uptake through heart or ventilation rate was found. Heart rate decreased in diploid non-transgenics while ventilation rate decreased in both diploid non-transgenics and triploid transgenics in severe hypoxia. Regardless of genotype or treatment, inducible HSP70 was not expressed in alevins. Following hypoxia, the constitutive isoform of HSP70, HSC70, decreased in transgenics and HSP90 expression decreased in all genotypes. These data suggest that physiological changes through GH transgenesis and polyploidy are manifested during early ontogeny in Atlantic salmon."},{"title":"Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of water flow in the mantle cavity of live Mytilus galloprovincialis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2277","abstract":"Water flow inside the shell of Mytilus galloprovincialis was measured by phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In seawater without algal cells at 23°C, water approached the mussel from the posterior-ventral side, and entered through the inhalant aperture at a velocity of 40–20 mm s−1. The flow rate in the lower mantle cavity decreased to 10–20 mm s−1, the water flowed in the anterior–dorsal direction and approached the demibranches at a velocity of 5–10 mm s−1. After passing through the lamellae to the upper mantle cavity, the water stretched the interlamellar cavity, turned to the posterior–dorsal direction and accumulated in the epibranchial cavity. The water flows came together at the ventral side of the posterior adductor muscle. The velocity increased more to than 50 mm s−1 in the exhalant siphon, and exhaled out in the posterior–dorsal direction. The anterior–posterior direction of the flow was imaged every 1.92 s by the inflow effect of T1-weighted MRI. The flow seemed to be constant, and no cyclic motion of the mantles or the gills was detected. Spontaneous closure of the shells caused a quick drop of the flow in the mantle cavity. In the opening process of the shells, water flow in the interlamellar cavities increased before the opening, followed by an increase of flows in the exhalant siphon and inhalant aperture with minimum delay, reaching a plateau within 1 min of the shells opening. This provides direct evidence that the lateral cilia drive water in the mussel M. galloprovincialis."},{"title":"Do Tetranychus urticae males avoid mating with familiar females?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2297","abstract":"The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, usually lives in kin groups under common webs. Because only the first mating results in fertilisation in female T. urticae, adult males guard quiescent deutonymph females, those at the stage immediately before maturation, to ensure paternity. Therefore, the cost of precopulatory guarding time seems considerable for males. Moreover, the fitness indices of daughters from intra-population crosses were significantly lower than those of daughters from inter-population crosses, indicating that inbreeding depression exists in T. urticae. Therefore, we hypothesised that T. urticae males should be choosy in guarding familiar females to avoid inbreeding depression. Furthermore, webs should be a key element of the environment shared by familiar individuals. In this study, we demonstrated the inbreeding avoidance mechanism of T. urticae males in relation to webs produced by familiar females (known webs) or unfamiliar females (unknown webs). Regardless of surrounding webs (known or unknown), males preferred unfamiliar to familiar females. We further examined whether males detect unfamiliar females by their webs. When males had experienced a female's web without encountering that female, they subsequently preferred females that did not produce the surrounding webs in which the choice experiment was conducted. Results suggest that putative kin recognition for inbreeding avoidance in T. urticae males is based on the relationship between webs and females, and not on the discrimination of webs in shared environments."},{"title":"Defensive slime formation in Pacific hagfish requires Ca2+- and aquaporin-mediated swelling of released mucin vesicles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2288","abstract":"Hagfishes defend themselves from fish predators via the rapid deployment of a fibrous slime that adheres to and clogs gills. The slime transforms from a thick glandular exudate to a fully hydrated product in a fraction of a second through a process that involves the swelling and rupture of numerous mucin vesicles. Here we demonstrate that the vesicle membrane plays an important role in regulating the swelling of mucin granules, and provide evidence that the membrane contains proteins that facilitate the movement of ions and water molecules. By exposing isolated mucin vesicles to varying combinations of inorganic ions, organic compounds and membrane channel inhibitors, we found that the majority of hagfish mucin vesicles require Ca2+ to rupture. We also show that Ca2+-dependent rupture can be pharmacologically inhibited, which suggests a role for Ca2+-activated membrane transporters. We demonstrate that the aquaporin inhibitor mercuric chloride reduces the rate of vesicle swelling by an order of magnitude, which suggests that aquaporins facilitate the influx of water during vesicle deployment. Molecular evidence of two aquaporin homologues expressed in the slime glands further supports this idea. We propose a model of hagfish slime mucin vesicle rupture that involves Ca2+-activated transporters and aquaporins, and suggest that the presence of these proteins is an adaptation for increasing the speed of vesicle rupture and, consequently, the speed of the sliming response of hagfishes."},{"title":"Olfactory learning and memory in the disease vector mosquito Aedes aegypti","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2321","abstract":"Olfactory learning in blood-feeding insects, such as mosquitoes, could play an important role in host preference and disease transmission. However, standardised protocols allowing testing of their learning abilities are currently lacking, and how different olfactory stimuli are learned by these insects remains unknown. Using a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm, we trained individuals and groups of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to associate an odorant conditioned stimulus (CS) with a blood-reinforced thermal stimulus (unconditioned stimulus; US). Results showed, first, that mosquitoes could learn the association between L-lactic acid and the US, and retained the association for at least 24 h. Second, the success of olfactory conditioning was dependent upon the CS – some odorants that elicited indifferent responses in naïve mosquitoes, such as L-lactic acid and 1-octen-3-ol, were readily learned, whereas others went from aversive to attractive after training (Z-3-hexen-1-ol) or were untrainable (β-myrcene and benzyl alcohol). Third, we examined whether mosquitoes' ability to learn could interfere with the action of the insect repellent DEET. Results demonstrated that pre-exposure and the presence of DEET in the CS reduced the aversive effects of DEET. Last, the nature of the formed memories was explored. Experiments using cold-shock treatments within the first 6 h post-training (for testing anaesthesia-resistant memory) and a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide; to disrupt the formation of long-term memory) both affected mosquitoes' performances. Together, these results show that learning is a crucial component in odour responses in A. aegypti, and provide the first evidence for the functional role of different memory traces in these responses."},{"title":"Control of moth flight posture is mediated by wing mechanosensory feedback","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2301","abstract":"Flying insects rapidly stabilize after perturbations using both visual and mechanosensory inputs for active control. Insect halteres are mechanosensory organs that encode inertial forces to aid rapid course correction during flight but serve no aerodynamic role and are specific to two orders of insects (Diptera and Strepsiptera). Aside from the literature on halteres and recent work on the antennae of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, it is unclear how other flying insects use mechanosensory information to control body dynamics. The mechanosensory structures found on the halteres, campaniform sensilla, are also present on wings, suggesting that the wings can encode information about flight dynamics. We show that the neurons innervating these sensilla on the forewings of M. sexta exhibit spike-timing precision comparable to that seen in previous reports of campaniform sensilla, including haltere neurons. In addition, by attaching magnets to the wings of moths and subjecting these animals to a simulated pitch stimulus via a rotating magnetic field during tethered flight, we elicited the same vertical abdominal flexion reflex these animals exhibit in response to visual or inertial pitch stimuli. Our results indicate that, in addition to their role as actuators during locomotion, insect wings serve as sensors that initiate reflexes that control body dynamics."},{"title":"Osmoregulation in the Hawaiian anchialine shrimp Halocaridina rubra (Crustacea: Atyidae): expression of ion transporters, mitochondria-rich cell proliferation and hemolymph osmolality during salinity transfers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2309","abstract":"Studies of euryhaline crustaceans have identified conserved osmoregulatory adaptions allowing hyper-osmoregulation in dilute waters. However, previous studies have mainly examined decapod brachyurans with marine ancestries inhabiting estuaries or tidal creeks on a seasonal basis. Here, we describe osmoregulation in the atyid Halocaridina rubra, an endemic Hawaiian shrimp of freshwater ancestry from the islands' anchialine ecosystem (coastal ponds with subsurface freshwater and seawater connections) that encounters near-continuous spatial and temporal salinity changes. Given this, survival and osmoregulatory responses were examined over a wide salinity range. In the laboratory, H. rubra tolerated salinities of ~0–56‰, acting as both a hyper- and hypo-osmoregulator and maintaining a maximum osmotic gradient of ~868 mOsm kg−1 H2O in freshwater. Furthermore, hemolymph osmolality was more stable during salinity transfers relative to other crustaceans. Silver nitrate and vital mitochondria-rich cell staining suggest all gills are osmoregulatory, with a large proportion of each individual gill functioning in ion transport (including when H. rubra acts as an osmoconformer in seawater). Additionally, expression of ion transporters and supporting enzymes that typically undergo upregulation during salinity transfer in osmoregulatory gills (i.e. Na+/K+-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase, Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter, V-type H+-ATPase and arginine kinase) were generally unaltered in H. rubra during similar transfers. These results suggest H. rubra (and possibly other anchialine species) maintains high, constitutive levels of gene expression and ion transport capability in the gills as a means of potentially coping with the fluctuating salinities that are encountered in anchialine habitats. Thus, anchialine taxa represent an interesting avenue for future physiological research."},{"title":"Behavioral and metabolic contributions to thermoregulation in freely swimming leatherback turtles at high latitudes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/13/2331","abstract":"Leatherback turtles in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean have a broad geographic range that extends from nesting beaches near the equator to seasonal foraging grounds as far north as Canada. The ability of leatherbacks to maintain core body temperature (Tb) higher than that of the surrounding water is thought to be a key element of their biology that permits them to exploit productive waters at high latitudes. We provide the first recordings of Tb from freely swimming leatherbacks at a northern foraging ground, and use these data to assess the importance of behavioral adjustments and metabolic sources of heat for maintenance of the thermal gradient (Tg). The mean Tb for individual leatherbacks ranged from 25.4±1.7 to 27.3±0.3°C, and Tg ranged from 10.7±2.4 to 12.1±1.7°C. Variation in mean Tb was best explained by the amount of time that turtles spent in the relatively warm surface waters. A diel trend in Tb was apparent, with daytime cooling suggestive of prey ingestion and night-time warming attributable to endogenous heat production. We estimate that metabolic rates necessary to support the observed Tg are ~3 times higher than resting metabolic rate, and that specific dynamic action is an important source of heat for foraging leatherbacks."},{"title":"Inhibition of photosynthetic CO2 fixation in the coral Pocillopora damicornis and its relationship to thermal bleaching","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2150","abstract":"Two inhibitors of the Calvin–Benson cycle [glycolaldehyde (GA) and potassium cyanide (KCN)] were used in cultured Symbiodinium cells and in nubbins of the coral Pocillopora damicornis to test the hypothesis that inhibition of the Calvin–Benson cycle triggers coral bleaching. Inhibitor concentration range-finding trials aimed to determine the appropriate concentration to generate inhibition of the Calvin–Benson cycle, but avoid other metabolic impacts to the symbiont and the animal host. Both 3 mmol l−1 GA and 20 μmol l−1 KCN caused minimal inhibition of host respiration, but did induce photosynthetic impairment, measured by a loss of photosystem II function and oxygen production. GA did not affect the severity of bleaching, nor induce bleaching in the absence of thermal stress, suggesting inhibition of the Calvin–Benson cycle by GA does not initiate bleaching in P. damicornis. In contrast, KCN did activate a bleaching response through symbiont expulsion, which occurred in the presence and absence of thermal stress. While KCN is an inhibitor of the Calvin–Benson cycle, it also promotes reactive oxygen species formation, and it is likely that this was the principal agent in the coral bleaching process. These findings do not support the hypothesis that temperature-induced inhibition of the Calvin–Benson cycle alone induces coral bleaching."},{"title":"Paradox of the drinking-straw model of the butterfly proboscis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2130","abstract":"Fluid-feeding Lepidoptera use an elongated proboscis, conventionally modeled as a drinking straw, to feed from pools and films of liquid. Using the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (Linnaeus), we show that the inherent structural features of the lepidopteran proboscis contradict the basic assumptions of the drinking-straw model. By experimentally characterizing permeability and flow in the proboscis, we show that tapering of the food canal in the drinking region increases resistance, significantly hindering the flow of fluid. The calculated pressure differential required for a suction pump to support flow along the entire proboscis is greater than 1 atm (~101 kPa) when the butterfly feeds from a pool of liquid. We suggest that behavioral strategies employed by butterflies and moths can resolve this paradoxical pressure anomaly. Butterflies can alter the taper, the interlegular spacing and the terminal opening of the food canal, thereby controlling fluid entry and flow, by splaying the galeal tips apart, sliding the galeae along one another, pulsing hemolymph into each galeal lumen, and pressing the proboscis against a substrate. Thus, although physical construction of the proboscis limits its mechanical capabilities, its functionality can be modified and enhanced by behavioral strategies."},{"title":"Upper body contributions to power generation during rapid, overhand throwing in humans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2139","abstract":"High-speed and accurate throwing is a distinctive human behavior. Achieving fast projectile speeds during throwing requires a combination of elastic energy storage at the shoulder, as well as the transfer of kinetic energy from proximal body segments to distal segments. However, the biomechanical bases of these mechanisms are not completely understood. We used inverse dynamics analyses of kinematic data from 20 baseball players fitted with four different braces that inhibit specific motions to test a model of power generation at key joints during the throwing motion. We found that most of the work produced during throwing is generated at the hips, and much of this work (combined with smaller contributions from the pectoralis major) is used to load elastic elements in the shoulder and power the rapid acceleration of the projectile. Despite rapid angular velocities at the elbow and wrist, the restrictions confirm that much of the power generated to produce these distal movements comes from larger proximal segments, such as the shoulder and torso. Wrist hyperextension enhances performance only modestly. Together, our data also suggest that heavy reliance on elastic energy storage may help explain some common throwing injuries and can provide further insight into the evolution of the upper body and when our ancestors first developed the ability to produce high-speed throws."},{"title":"The length–force behavior and operating length range of squid muscle vary as a function of position in the mantle wall","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2181","abstract":"Hollow cylindrical muscular organs are widespread in animals and are effective in providing support for locomotion and movement, yet are subject to significant non-uniformities in circumferential muscle strain. During contraction of the mantle of squid, the circular muscle fibers along the inner (lumen) surface of the mantle experience circumferential strains 1.3 to 1.6 times greater than fibers along the outer surface of the mantle. This transmural gradient of strain may require the circular muscle fibers near the inner and outer surfaces of the mantle to operate in different regions of the length–tension curve during a given mantle contraction cycle. We tested the hypothesis that circular muscle contractile properties vary transmurally in the mantle of the Atlantic longfin squid, Doryteuthis pealeii. We found that both the length–twitch force and length–tetanic force relationships of the obliquely striated, central mitochondria-poor (CMP) circular muscle fibers varied with radial position in the mantle wall. CMP circular fibers near the inner surface of the mantle produced higher force relative to maximum isometric tetanic force, P0, at all points along the ascending limb of the length–tension curve than CMP circular fibers near the outer surface of the mantle. The mean ± s.d. maximum isometric tetanic stresses at L0 (the preparation length that produced the maximum isometric tetanic force) of 212±105 and 290±166 kN m−2 for the fibers from the outer and inner surfaces of the mantle, respectively, did not differ significantly (P=0.29). The mean twitch:tetanus ratios for the outer and inner preparations, 0.60±0.085 and 0.58±0.10, respectively, did not differ significantly (P=0.67). The circular fibers did not exhibit length-dependent changes in contraction kinetics when given a twitch stimulus. As the stimulation frequency increased, L0 was approximately 1.06 times longer than LTW, the mean preparation length that yielded maximum isometric twitch force. Sonomicrometry experiments revealed that the CMP circular muscle fibers operated in vivo primarily along the ascending limb of the length–tension curve. The CMP fibers functioned routinely over muscle lengths at which force output ranged from only 85% to 40% of P0, and during escape jets from 100% to 30% of P0. Our work shows that the functional diversity of obliquely striated muscles is much greater than previously recognized."},{"title":"Water surface locomotion in tropical canopy ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2163","abstract":"Upon falling onto the water surface, most terrestrial arthropods helplessly struggle and are quickly eaten by aquatic predators. Exceptions to this outcome mostly occur among riparian taxa that escape by walking or swimming at the water surface. Here we document sustained, directional, neustonic locomotion (i.e. surface swimming) in tropical arboreal ants. We dropped 35 species of ants into natural and artificial aquatic settings in Peru and Panama to assess their swimming ability. Ten species showed directed surface swimming at speeds >3 body lengths s−1, with some swimming at absolute speeds >10 cm s−1. Ten other species exhibited partial swimming ability characterized by relatively slow but directed movement. The remaining species showed no locomotory control at the surface. The phylogenetic distribution of swimming among ant genera indicates parallel evolution and a trend toward negative association with directed aerial descent behavior. Experiments with workers of Odontomachus bauri showed that they escape from the water by directing their swimming toward dark emergent objects (i.e. skototaxis). Analyses of high-speed video images indicate that Pachycondyla spp. and O. bauri use a modified alternating tripod gait when swimming; they generate thrust at the water surface via synchronized treading and rowing motions of the contralateral fore and mid legs, respectively, while the hind legs provide roll stability. These results expand the list of facultatively neustonic terrestrial taxa to include various species of tropical arboreal ants."},{"title":"The four aldehyde oxidases of Drosophila melanogaster have different gene expression patterns and enzyme substrate specificities","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2201","abstract":"In the genome of Drosophila melanogaster, four genes coding for aldehyde oxidases (AOX1–4) were identified on chromosome 3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the AOX gene cluster evolved via independent duplication events in the vertebrate and invertebrate lineages. The functional role and the substrate specificity of the distinct Drosophila AOX enzymes is unknown. Two loss-of-function mutant alleles in this gene region, low pyridoxal oxidase (Polpo) and aldehyde oxidase-1 (Aldox-1n1) are associated with a phenotype characterized by undetectable AOX enzymatic activity. However, the genes involved and the corresponding mutations have not yet been identified. In this study we characterized the activities, substrate specificities and expression profiles of the four AOX enzymes in D. melanogaster. We show that the Polpo-associated phenotype is the consequence of a structural alteration of the AOX1 gene. We identified an 11-bp deletion in the Polpo allele, resulting in a frame-shift event, which removes the molybdenum cofactor domain of the encoded enzyme. Furthermore, we show that AOX2 activity is detectable only during metamorphosis and characterize a Minos-AOX2 insertion in this developmental gene that disrupts its activity. We demonstrate that the Aldox-1n1 phenotype maps to the AOX3 gene and AOX4 activity is not detectable in our assays."},{"title":"mRNA degradation: an underestimated factor in steady-state transcript levels of cytochrome c oxidase subunits?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2212","abstract":"Steady-state mRNA levels are determined by synthesis and degradation; however, changes in mRNA levels are usually attributed to transcription. For cytochrome c oxidase (COX), cold acclimation typically leads to an increase in COX activity while transcript levels for the nuclear-encoded subunits change non-stoichiometrically. Whether those patterns are caused by differences in subunit transcription rates, decay rates or both was not known. We assessed decay rates of transcripts for COX subunits, including representatives that decreased, increased in parallel with COX or increased in excess of COX. Low temperature reduced the decay rate of all transcripts; however, COX subunits displayed higher thermal sensitivity than housekeeping genes. The lower decay rates for COX transcripts might explain some of their increase in response to cold acclimation. The reason for the exaggerated transcript response of two subunits (COX6B-1 and COX7A-2) may be due to decreased decay. However, decay rate differences could not explain the patterns seen with another subunit that did not change in mRNA level with thermal acclimation (COX6A-2). Further, the decay patterns differed between two thermal acclimation experiments, which may explain some of the heterogeneity seen in fish studies. The differences in decay rates suggest that the lack of stoichiometry in mRNA levels is exacerbated by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Collectively, these results suggest that temperature-induced differences in COX subunit mRNA levels and deviations from stoichiometry between them may partially arise from subunit-specific sensitivities to degradation. We suggest that all subunits are controlled by transcription, and that exaggerated responses of some subunits are due to reduced decay rates."},{"title":"Generalization and discrimination tasks yield concordant measures of perceived distance between odours and their binary mixtures in larval Drosophila","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2071","abstract":"Similarity between odours is notoriously difficult to measure. Widely used behavioural approaches in insect olfaction research are cross-adaptation, masking, as well as associative tasks based on olfactory learning and the subsequent testing for how specific the established memory is. A concern with such memory-based approaches is that the learning process required to establish an odour memory may alter the way the odour is processed, such that measures of perception taken at the test are distorted. The present study was therefore designed to see whether behavioural judgements of perceptual distance are different for two different memory-based tasks, namely generalization and discrimination. We used odour–reward learning in larval Drosophila as a study case. In order to challenge the larvae's olfactory system, we chose to work with binary mixtures and their elements (1-octanol, n-amyl acetate, 3-octanol, benzaldehyde and hexyl acetate). We determined the perceptual distance between each mixture and its elements, first in a generalization task, and then in a discrimination task. It turns out that scores of perceptual distance are correlated between both tasks. A re-analysis of published studies looking at element-to-element perceptual distances in larval reward learning and in adult punishment learning confirms this result. We therefore suggest that across a given set of olfactory stimuli, associative training does not grossly alter the pattern of perceptual distances."},{"title":"Use of the swim bladder and lateral line in near-field sound source localization by fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2078","abstract":"We investigated the roles of the swim bladder and the lateral line system in sound localization behavior by the plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus). Reproductive female midshipman underwent either surgical deflation of the swim bladder or cryoablation of the lateral line and were then tested in a monopolar sound source localization task. Fish with nominally ‘deflated’ swim bladders performed similar to sham-deflated controls; however, post-experiment evaluation of swim bladder deflation revealed that a majority of ‘deflated’ fish (88%, seven of the eight fish) that exhibited positive phonotaxis had partially inflated swim bladders. In total, 95% (21/22) of fish that localized the source had at least partially inflated swim bladders, indicating that pressure reception is likely required for sound source localization. In lateral line experiments, no difference was observed in the proportion of females exhibiting positive phonotaxis with ablated (37%) versus sham-ablated (47%) lateral line systems. These data suggest that the lateral line system is likely not required for sound source localization, although this system may be important for fine-tuning the approach to the sound source. We found that midshipman can solve the 180 deg ambiguity of source direction in the shallow water of our test tank, which is similar to their nesting environment. We also found that the potential directional cues (phase relationship between pressure and particle motion) in shallow water differs from a theoretical free-field. Therefore, the general question of how fish use acoustic pressure cues to solve the 180 deg ambiguity of source direction from the particle motion vector remains unresolved."},{"title":"Defective skeletogenesis and oversized otoliths in fish early stages in a changing ocean","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2062","abstract":"Early life stages of many marine organisms are being challenged by rising seawater temperature and CO2 concentrations, but their physiological responses to these environmental changes still remain unclear.

Exposure to future conditions caused a decline in hatching success and larval survival. Growth, metabolic rates and thermal tolerance increased with temperature but decreased under acidified conditions. Hypercapnia and warming amplified the incidence of deformities by 31.5% (including severe deformities such as lordosis, scoliosis and kyphosis), while promoting the occurrence of oversized otoliths (109.3% increase). Smaller larvae with greater skeletal deformities and larger otoliths may face major ecophysiological challenges, which might potentiate substantial declines in adult fish populations, putting in jeopardy the species' fitness under a changing ocean."},{"title":"Fire ants actively control spacing and orientation within self-assemblages","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2089","abstract":"To overcome obstacles and survive harsh environments, fire ants link their bodies together to form self-assemblages such as rafts, bridges and bivouacs. Such structures are examples of self-assembling and self-healing materials, as ants can quickly create and break links with one another in response to changes in their environment. Because ants are opaque, the arrangement of the ants within these three-dimensional networks was previously unknown. In this experimental study, we applied micro-scale computed tomography, or micro-CT, to visualize the connectivity, arrangement and orientation of ants within an assemblage. We identified active and geometric mechanisms that ants use to obtain favorable packing properties with respect to well-studied packing of inert objects such as cylinders. Ants use their legs to push against their neighbors, doubling their spacing relative to random packing of cylinders. These legs also permit active control of their orientation, an ability ants use to arrange themselves perpendicularly rather than in parallel. Lastly, we found an important role of ant polymorphism in promoting self-aggregation: a large distribution of ant sizes permits small ants to fit between the legs of larger ants, a phenomenon that increases the number of average connections per ant. These combined mechanisms lead to low packing fraction and high connectivity, which increase raft buoyancy and strength during flash floods."},{"title":"The effect of water temperature and flow on respiration in barnacles: patterns of mass transfer versus kinetic limitation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2101","abstract":"In aquatic systems, physiological processes such as respiration, photosynthesis and calcification are potentially limited by the exchange of dissolved materials between organisms and their environment. The nature and extent of physiological limitation is, therefore, likely to be dependent on environmental conditions. Here, we assessed the metabolic sensitivity of barnacles under a range of water temperatures and velocities, two factors that influence their distribution. Respiration rates increased in response to changes in temperature and flow, with an interaction where flow had less influence on respiration at low temperatures, and a much larger effect at high temperatures. Model analysis suggested that respiration is mass transfer limited under conditions of low velocity (<7.5 cm −1) and high temperature (20–25°C). In contrast, limitation by uptake reaction kinetics, when the biotic capacity of barnacles to absorb and process oxygen is slower than its physical delivery by mass transport, prevailed at high flows (40–150 cm s−1) and low temperatures (5–15°C). Moreover, there are intermediate flow-temperature conditions where both mass transfer and kinetic limitation are important. Behavioral monitoring revealed that barnacles fully extend their cirral appendages at low flows and display abbreviated ‘testing’ behaviors at high flows, suggesting some form of mechanical limitation. In low flow–high temperature treatments, however, barnacles displayed distinct ‘pumping’ behaviors that may serve to increase ventilation. Our results suggest that in slow-moving waters, respiration may become mass transfer limited as temperatures rise, whereas faster flows may serve to ameliorate the effects of elevated temperatures. Moreover, these results underscore the necessity for approaches that evaluate the combined effects of multiple environmental factors when examining physiological and behavioral performance."},{"title":"The effects of naris occlusion on mouse nasal turbinate development","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2044","abstract":"Unilateral naris occlusion, a standard method for causing odor deprivation, also alters airflow on both sides of the nasal cavity. We reasoned that manipulating airflow by occlusion could affect nasal turbinate development given the ubiquitous role of environmental stimuli in ontogenesis. To test this hypothesis, newborn mice received unilateral occlusion or sham surgery and were allowed to reach adulthood. Morphological measurements were then made of paraffin sections of the whole nasal cavity. Occlusion significantly affected the size, shape and position of turbinates. In particular, the nasoturbinate, the focus of our quantitative analysis, had a more delicate appearance on the occluded side relative to the open side. Occlusion also caused an increase in the width of the dorsal meatus within the non-occluded and occluded nasal fossae, compared with controls, and the position of most turbinates was altered. These results suggest that a mechanical stimulus from respiratory airflow is necessary for the normal morphological development of turbinates. To explore this idea, we estimated the mechanical forces on turbinates caused by airflow during normal respiration that would be absent as a result of occlusion. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were used to construct a three-dimensional model of the mouse nasal cavity that provided the input for a computational fluid dynamics simulation of nasal airflow. The simulation revealed maximum shear stress values for the walls of turbinates in the 1 Pa range, a magnitude that causes remodeling in other biological tissues. These observations raise the intriguing possibility that nasal turbinates develop partly under the control of respiratory mechanical forces."},{"title":"Responses of Drosophila giant descending neurons to visual and mechanical stimuli","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2121","abstract":"In Drosophila, the paired giant descending neurons (GDNs), also known as giant fibers, and the paired giant antennal mechanosensory descending neurons (GAMDNs), are supplied by visual and mechanosensory inputs.

The GDN axon thereafter widens to become the largest axon in the thoracic ganglia, supplying information to leg extensor and wing depressor muscles. The GAMDN axon remains slender, interacting with other descending neuron axons medially. GDN and GAMDN dendrites are partitioned to receive inputs from antennal mechanosensory afferents and inputs from the optic lobes. Although GDN anatomy has been well studied in Musca domestica, less is known about the Drosophila homolog, including electrophysiological responses to sensory stimuli. Here we provide detailed anatomical comparisons of the GDN and the GAMDN, characterizing their sensory inputs. The GDN showed responses to light-on and light-off stimuli, expanding stimuli that result in luminance decrease, mechanical stimulation of the antennae, and combined mechanical and visual stimulation. We show that ensembles of lobula columnar neurons (type Col A) and mechanosensory antennal afferents are likely responsible for these responses. The reluctance of the GDN to spike in response to stimulation confirms observations of the Musca GDN. That this reluctance may be a unique property of the GDN is suggested by comparisons with the GAMDN, in which action potentials are readily elicited by mechanical and visual stimuli. The results are discussed in the context of descending pathways involved in multimodal integration and escape responses."},{"title":"Undulatory locomotion of flexible foils as biomimetic models for understanding fish propulsion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2110","abstract":"An undulatory pattern of body bending in which waves pass along the body from head to tail is a major mechanism of creating thrust in many fish species during steady locomotion. Analyses of live fish swimming have provided the foundation of our current understanding of undulatory locomotion, but our inability to experimentally manipulate key variables such as body length, flexural stiffness and tailbeat frequency in freely swimming fish has limited our ability to investigate a number of important features of undulatory propulsion. In this paper we use a mechanical flapping apparatus to create an undulatory wave in swimming flexible foils driven with a heave motion at their leading edge, and compare this motion with body bending patterns of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) and clown knifefish (Notopterus chitala). We found similar swimming speeds, Reynolds and Strouhal numbers, and patterns of curvature and shape between these fish and foils, suggesting that flexible foils provide a useful model for understanding fish undulatory locomotion. We swam foils with different lengths, stiffnesses and heave frequencies while measuring forces, torques and hydrodynamics. From measured forces and torques we calculated thrust and power coefficients, work and cost of transport for each foil. We found that increasing frequency and stiffness produced faster swimming speeds and more thrust. Increasing length had minimal impact on swimming speed, but had a large impact on Strouhal number, thrust coefficient and cost of transport. Foils that were both stiff and long had the lowest cost of transport (in mJ m−1 g−1) at low cycle frequencies, and the ability to reach the highest speed at high cycle frequencies."},{"title":"Wood frog adaptations to overwintering in Alaska: new limits to freezing tolerance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2193","abstract":"We investigated the ecological physiology and behavior of free-living wood frogs [Lithobates (Rana) sylvaticus] overwintering in Interior Alaska by tracking animals into natural hibernacula, recording microclimate, and determining frog survival in spring. We measured cryoprotectant (glucose) concentrations and identified the presence of antifreeze glycolipids in tissues from subsamples of naturally freezing frogs. We also recorded the behavior of wood frogs preparing to freeze in artificial hibernacula, and tissue glucose concentrations in captive wood frogs frozen in the laboratory to −2.5°C. Wood frogs in natural hibernacula remained frozen for 193±11 consecutive days and experienced average (October–May) temperatures of −6.3°C and average minimum temperatures of −14.6±2.8°C (range −8.9 to −18.1°C) with 100% survival (N=18). Mean glucose concentrations were 13-fold higher in muscle, 10-fold higher in heart and 3.3-fold higher in liver in naturally freezing compared with laboratory frozen frogs. Antifreeze glycolipid was present in extracts from muscle and internal organs, but not skin, of frozen frogs. Wood frogs in Interior Alaska survive freezing to extreme limits and durations compared with those described in animals collected in southern Canada or the Midwestern United States. We hypothesize that this enhancement of freeze tolerance in Alaskan wood frogs is due to higher cryoprotectant levels that are produced by repeated freezing and thawing cycles experienced under natural conditions during early autumn."},{"title":"Energetic demands of immature sea otters from birth to weaning: implications for maternal costs, reproductive behavior and population-level trends","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2053","abstract":"Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) have the highest mass-specific metabolic rate of any marine mammal, which is superimposed on the inherently high costs of reproduction and lactation in adult females. These combined energetic demands have been implicated in the poor body condition and increased mortality of female sea otters nearing the end of lactation along the central California coast. However, the cost of lactation is unknown and currently cannot be directly measured for this marine species in the wild. Here, we quantified the energetic demands of immature sea otters across five developmental stages as a means of assessing the underlying energetic challenges associated with pup rearing that may contribute to poor maternal condition. Activity-specific metabolic rates, daily activity budgets and field metabolic rates (FMR) were determined for each developmental stage. Mean FMR of pre-molt pups was 2.29±0.81 MJ day−1 and increased to 6.16±2.46 and 7.41±3.17 MJ day−1 in post-molt pups and dependent immature animals, respectively. Consequently, daily energy demands of adult females increase 17% by 3 weeks postpartum and continue increasing to 96% above pre-pregnancy levels by the average age of weaning. Our results suggest that the energetics of pup rearing superimposed on small body size, marine living and limited on-board energetic reserves conspire to make female sea otters exceptionally vulnerable to energetic shortfalls. By controlling individual fitness, maternal behavior and pup provisioning strategies, this underlying metabolic challenge appears to be a major factor influencing current population trends in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis)."},{"title":"Coloration principles of nymphaline butterflies – thin films, melanin, ommochromes and wing scale stacking","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/12/2171","abstract":"The coloration of the common butterflies Aglais urticae (small tortoiseshell), Aglais io (peacock) and Vanessa atalanta (red admiral), belonging to the butterfly subfamily Nymphalinae, is due to the species-specific patterning of differently coloured scales on their wings. We investigated the scales' structural and pigmentary properties by applying scanning electron microscopy, (micro)spectrophotometry and imaging scatterometry. The anatomy of the wing scales appears to be basically identical, with an approximately flat lower lamina connected by trabeculae to a highly structured upper lamina, which consists of an array of longitudinal, parallel ridges and transversal crossribs. Isolated scales observed at the abwing (upper) side are blue, yellow, orange, red, brown or black, depending on their pigmentation. The yellow, orange and red scales contain various amounts of 3-OH-kynurenine and ommochrome pigment, black scales contain a high density of melanin, and blue scales have a minor amount of melanin pigment. Observing the scales from their adwing (lower) side always revealed a structural colour, which is blue in the case of blue, red and black scales, but orange for orange scales. The structural colours are created by the lower lamina, which acts as an optical thin film. Its reflectance spectrum, crucially determined by the lamina thickness, appears to be well tuned to the scales' pigmentary spectrum. The colours observed locally on the wing are also due to the degree of scale stacking. Thin films, tuned pigments and combinations of stacked scales together determine the wing coloration of nymphaline butterflies."},{"title":"Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly Pieris rapae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/2013","abstract":"The butterfly Pieirs rapae drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies."},{"title":"Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/2004","abstract":"Maternal temperature is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with temperature changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica to investigate the influence of maternal temperature on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother–offspring temperatures did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when temperatures persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother–offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational effect of temperature on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences."},{"title":"Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1993","abstract":"Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (Km,ADP and Vmax) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, Km,ADP was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-l-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O2 consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix."},{"title":"Moving without a purpose: an experimental study of swarm guidance in the Western honey bee, Apis mellifera","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/2020","abstract":"During reproductive swarming, honey bee scouts perform two very important functions. Firstly, they find new nesting locations and return to the swarm cluster to communicate their discoveries. Secondly, once the swarm is ready to depart, informed scout bees act as guides, leading the swarm to its final destination. We have previously hypothesised that the two processes, selecting a new nest site and swarm guidance, are tightly linked in honey bees. When swarms can be laissez faire about where they nest, reaching directional consensus prior to lift off seems unnecessary. If, in contrast, it is essential that the swarm reaches a precise location, either directional consensus must be near unanimous prior to swarm departure or only a select subgroup of the scouts guide the swarm. Here, we tested experimentally whether directional consensus is necessary for the successful guidance of swarms of the Western honey bee Apis mellifera by forcing swarms into the air prior to the completion of the decision-making process. Our results show that swarms were unable to guide themselves prior to the swarm reaching the pre-flight buzzing phase of the decision-making process, even when directional consensus was high. We therefore suggest that not all scouts involved in the decision-making process attempt to guide the swarm."},{"title":"Prior experience with conspecific signals enhances auditory midbrain responsiveness to conspecific vocalizations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1977","abstract":"There is a long history in neuroethology of investigating how communication signals influence the brain and behavior. It has become increasingly clear that brain areas associated with sensory processing are plastic in adults and that this plasticity is related to reproductive condition. However, the role of communication signal reception in adult auditory plasticity has received relatively little attention. Here, we investigated whether the reception of communication signals (a frog chorus) could enhance the responsiveness of the auditory system to future reception of communication signals (a single male call). We found that animals that had been exposed to 10 days of a male chorus had stronger auditory midbrain immediate early gene expression than animals that had been exposed to 10 days of random tones when tested with 30 min of male calls or 30 min of tones. Our results suggest that exposure to dynamic social stimuli, like frog choruses, may play an important role in shaping the neural and behavioral responses to communication signals."},{"title":"A viral aphrodisiac in the cricket Gryllus texensis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1970","abstract":"We identified the insect iridovirus IIV-6/CrIV as a pathogen of the cricket Gryllus texensis using electron microscopy (EM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. EM showed that the virus attacks the fat body, an organ important for protein production, immune function and lipid storage. During infection the fat body hypertrophied, but egg production withered, leaving the lateral oviducts empty of eggs; the females were effectively sterile. EM of the testis of infected males suggests that the testis was not invaded by the virus, although sperm taken from the spermatophores of infected males showed little or no motility. Nevertheless, males and females continued to mate when infected. In fact, infected males were quicker to court females than uninfected controls. The virus benefits from the continued sexual behaviour of its host; transmission studies show that the virus can be spread through sexual contact. Sickness behaviour, the adaptive reduction of feeding and sexual behaviour that is induced by an activated immune system, was absent in infected crickets. Total haemolymph protein was reduced, as was phenoloxidase activity, suggesting a reduction in immune protein production by the fat body. The evidence suggests that during IIV-6/CrIV infection, the immune signal(s) that induces sickness behaviour is absent. Curtailment of a host's sickness behaviour may be necessary for any pathogen that is spread by host sexual behaviour."},{"title":"In vivo cranial bone strain and bite force in the agamid lizard Uromastyx geyri","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1983","abstract":"In vivo bone strain data are the most direct evidence of deformation and strain regimes in the vertebrate cranium during feeding and can provide important insights into skull morphology. Strain data have been collected during feeding across a wide range of mammals; in contrast, in vivo cranial bone strain data have been collected from few sauropsid taxa. Here we present bone strain data recorded from the jugal of the herbivorous agamid lizard Uromastyx geyri along with simultaneously recorded bite force. Principal and shear strain magnitudes in Uromastyx geyri were lower than cranial bone strains recorded in Alligator mississippiensis, but higher than those reported from herbivorous mammals. Our results suggest that variations in principal strain orientations in the facial skeleton are largely due to differences in feeding behavior and bite location, whereas food type has little impact on strain orientations. Furthermore, mean principal strain orientations differ between male and female Uromastyx during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in skull morphology."},{"title":"Biomechanics of substrate boring by fig wasps","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1946","abstract":"Female insects of diverse orders bore into substrates to deposit their eggs. Such insects must overcome several biomechanical challenges to successfully oviposit, which include the selection of suitable substrates through which the ovipositor can penetrate without itself fracturing. In many cases, the insect may also need to steer and manipulate the ovipositor within the substrate to deliver eggs at desired locations before rapidly retracting her ovipositor to avoid predation. In the case of female parasitoid ichneumonid wasps, this process is repeated multiple times during her lifetime, thus testing the ability of the ovipositioning apparatus to endure fracture and fatigue. What specific adaptations does the ovipositioning apparatus of a female ichneumonoid wasp possess to withstand these challenges? We addressed this question using a model system composed of parasitoid and pollinator fig wasps. First, we show that parasitoid ovipositor tips have teeth-like structures, preferentially enriched with zinc, unlike the smooth morphology of pollinator ovipositors. We describe sensillae present on the parasitoid ovipositor tip that are likely to aid in the detection of chemical species and mechanical deformations and sample microenvironments within the substrate. Second, using atomic force microscopy, we show that parasitoid tip regions have a higher modulus compared with regions proximal to the abdomen in parasitoid and pollinator ovipositors. Finally, we use videography to film wasps during substrate boring and analyse buckling of the ovipositor to estimate the forces required for substrate boring. Together, these results allow us to describe the biomechanical principles underlying substrate boring in parasitoid ichneumonid wasps. Such studies may be useful for the biomimetic design of surgical tools and in the use of novel mechanisms to bore through hard substrates."},{"title":"Intracellular pH and its response to CO2-driven seawater acidification in symbiotic versus non-symbiotic coral cells","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1963","abstract":"Regulating intracellular pH (pHi) is critical for optimising the metabolic activity of corals, yet the mechanisms involved in pH regulation and the buffering capacity within coral cells are not well understood. Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of pHi to PCO2-driven seawater acidification in cells isolated from Pocillopora damicornis. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the pHi response in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (pH 7.8) and CO2-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing pH from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO2 addition, by which time the external pH (pHe) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their pHi by 0.5 pH units above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO2 addition (0.2 pH unit drop in pHe) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0.3–0.4 pH units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the pHi of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the pHi recovered to control levels when photsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that photosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular acidosis after exposure to high CO2/low pH."},{"title":"The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in Xenopus laevis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1940","abstract":"Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in Xenopus laevis. To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise."},{"title":"Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1955","abstract":"Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish Astyanax fasciatus, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of A. fasciatus generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that A. fasciatus swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that A. fasciatus can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of generating water motion by mouth suction."},{"title":"Physiological basis of starvation resistance in Drosophila leontia: analysis of sexual dimorphism","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1849","abstract":"Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in Drosophila species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen Drosophila species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in D. leontia, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in D. leontia. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; P<0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=KSR–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in D. leontia."},{"title":"Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1860","abstract":"The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in animals with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that L. terrestris becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult worms gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling worms. We also found that the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle contraction scales near isometry. We hypothesize that the allometric scaling of earthworms may reflect changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with size."},{"title":"Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1876","abstract":"Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer."},{"title":"Cold acclimation alters the connective tissue content of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) heart","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1868","abstract":"Thermal acclimation can alter cardiac function and morphology in a number of fish species, but little is known about the regulation of these changes. The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (Danio rerio) cardiac morphology, collagen composition and connective tissue regulation. Heart volume, the thickness of the compact myocardium, collagen content and collagen fiber composition were compared between control (27°C) and cold-acclimated (20°C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. Collagen content and fiber composition of the pericardial membrane were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the volume of the contracted heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the compact myocardium. There was also a decrease in the collagen content of the compact myocardium and in the amount of thick collagen fibers throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased expression of the gene transcript for matrix metalloproteinase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and collagen Type I α1. We propose that the reduction in the thickness of the compact myocardium as well as the change in collagen content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zebrafish heart undergoes significant remodeling in response to cold acclimation."},{"title":"Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1887","abstract":"Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing system or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing system or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing system. We suggest that sound production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations."},{"title":"Gut microbiota dictates the metabolic response of Drosophila to diet","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1894","abstract":"Animal nutrition is profoundly influenced by the gut microbiota, but knowledge of the scope and core mechanisms of the underlying animal–microbiota interactions is fragmentary. To investigate the nutritional traits shaped by the gut microbiota of Drosophila, we determined the microbiota-dependent response of multiple metabolic and performance indices to systematically varied diet composition. Diet-dependent differences between Drosophila bearing its unmanipulated microbiota (conventional flies) and experimentally deprived of its microbiota (axenic flies) revealed evidence for: microbial sparing of dietary B vitamins, especially riboflavin, on low-yeast diets; microbial promotion of protein nutrition, particularly in females; and microbiota-mediated suppression of lipid/carbohydrate storage, especially on high sugar diets. The microbiota also sets the relationship between energy storage and body mass, indicative of microbial modulation of the host signaling networks that coordinate metabolism with body size. This analysis identifies the multiple impacts of the microbiota on the metabolism of Drosophila, and demonstrates that the significance of these different interactions varies with diet composition and host sex."},{"title":"Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (Phreatichthys andruzzii)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1902","abstract":"Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates.

Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical continuous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for continuous quantities and half not controlled for continuous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for continuous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli."},{"title":"Satellite cell activation and populations on single muscle-fiber cultures from adult zebrafish (Danio rerio)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1910","abstract":"Satellite cells (SCs), stem cells in skeletal muscle, are mitotically quiescent in adult mammals until activated for growth or regeneration. In mouse muscle, SCs are activated by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO–HGF signaling cascade. Here, the SC population on fibers from the adult, ectothermic zebrafish and SC responsiveness to activating stimuli were assessed using the model system of isolated fibers cultured at 27 and 21°C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met, and activation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture or in vivo. In dose–response studies, SC activation was increased by treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l−1) or HGF (10 ng ml−1) to maximum activation at lower concentrations of both than in previous studies of mouse fibers. HGF-induced activation was blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21°C. The effect of cyclical stretch (3 h at 4 cycles per minute) increased activation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and reduced by culture at 21°C. The number of c-met+ SCs per fiber increased rapidly (by 3 h) after stretching. The character of signaling in SC activation on zebrafish fibers, in particular temperature-dependent responses to HGF and stretch, gives new insights into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of muscle growth in teleosts and suggests the use of the single-fiber model system to explore the basis of fiber hyperplasia and the conservation of regulatory pathways between species."},{"title":"Evolutionary capacity of upper thermal limits: beyond single trait assessments","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1918","abstract":"Thermal tolerance is an important factor influencing the distribution of ectotherms, but we still have limited understanding of the ability of species to evolve different thermal limits. Recent studies suggest that species may have limited capacity to evolve higher thermal limits in response to slower, more ecologically relevant rates of warming. However, these conclusions are based on univariate estimates of adaptive capacity. To test these findings within an explicitly multivariate context, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to estimate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in Drosophila melanogaster. We assessed heat tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero only for the static measures of heat tolerance. Our G matrix analysis revealed that any response to selection for increased heat tolerance will largely be driven by static basal and hardened heat tolerance, with minimal contribution from ramping heat tolerance. These results suggest that the capacity to evolve upper thermal limits in nature may depend on the type of thermal stress experienced."},{"title":"Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1925","abstract":"The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates."},{"title":"Can bees see at a glance?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/11/1933","abstract":"Primates can analyse visual scenes extremely rapidly, making accurate decisions for presentation times of only 20 ms. We asked whether bumblebees, despite having potentially more limited processing power, could similarly detect and discriminate visual patterns presented for durations of 100 ms or less. Bumblebees detected stimuli and discriminated between differently oriented and coloured stimuli when presented as briefly as 25 ms but failed to identify ecologically relevant shapes (predatory spiders on flowers) even when presented for 100 ms. This suggests an important difference between primate and insect visual processing, so that while primates can capture entire visual scenes ‘at a glance’, insects might have to rely on continuous online sampling of the world around them, using a process of active vision, which requires longer integration times."},{"title":"Intra- and interspecific challenges modulate cortisol but not androgen levels in a year-round territorial damselfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1768","abstract":"Interactions between individuals of different species are commonplace in animal communities. Some behaviors displayed during these interspecific social interactions may be very similar to those displayed during intraspecific social interactions. However, whether functional analogies between intra- and interspecific behaviors translate at the proximate level into an overlap in their underlying endocrine mechanisms remains largely unknown. Because steroids both mediate social behaviors and respond to them, we approached this question by comparing the behavioral and steroid response of free-living dusky gregories (Stegastes nigricans) to standardized territorial intrusions (sTI) of either conspecific or heterospecific food competitors. Stegastes nigricans is a year-round territorial fish that ‘cultivates’ the algae on which it feeds and is highly aggressive to both intra- and interspecific intruders. Behavioral differences between intra- and interspecific aggressive responses to sTI were marginal, and sTI tests caused an increase in cortisol levels that was positively related with the levels of aggression. In contrast, androgen levels did not increase in response to sTI, yet they showed a positive relationship with agonistic behavior. These results parallel a pattern that was first described for year-round territorial bird species. Furthermore, they suggest that changes in endocrine-hormone levels during territoriality might be independent of the species that induces the territorial response."},{"title":"Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (Python bivittatus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1784","abstract":"Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by reversible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/217/10/1784/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/> via augmented convective oxygen transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated elevations of O2 demand and/or reduced O2 supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in P. bivittatus is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O2 supply–demand mismatch stimulates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered animals anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood oxygen content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic animals had heart rates 126% higher than those of fasted controls, which, coupled with a 71% increase in mean arterial pressure, suggests fed anemic animals were experiencing significantly elevated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic animals, which exhibited ventricles 39% larger than those of fasted controls and 28% larger than in fed controls. These findings support our hypothesis that those animals with a greater magnitude of O2 supply–demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The ‘low O2 signal’ stimulating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by elevated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics."},{"title":"Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1775","abstract":"The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing bone mass under increased mechanical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine in vivo tibial loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on tibial morphology and stiffness were determined using microcomputed tomography and in vivo bone strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the loaded tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to increased in vivo tibial stiffness. Stiffness in the loaded tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in bone material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional stiffness."},{"title":"The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1790","abstract":"Changes in metabolic state alter foraging behavior and food preference in animals. Here, I show that normally attractive food becomes repulsive to Caenorhabditis elegans if animals are chronically undernourished as a result of alimentary tract defects. This behavioral plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased food leaving and induction of aversive behavior towards food. A particularly strong food avoider is defective in the chitin synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. Food avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. Food avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the animals are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses food avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory learning of harmful food. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via nutrient sensors, population size and olfactory neurons guides food preference in C. elegans."},{"title":"The role of the olfactory recess in olfactory airflow","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1799","abstract":"The olfactory recess – a blind pocket at the back of the nasal airway – is thought to play an important role in mammalian olfaction by sequestering air outside of the main airstream, thus giving odorants time to re-circulate. Several studies have shown that species with large olfactory recesses tend to have a well-developed sense of smell. However, no study has investigated how the size of the olfactory recess relates to air circulation near the olfactory epithelium. Here we used a computer model of the nasal cavity from a bat (Carollia perspicillata) to test the hypothesis that a larger olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow. We predicted that during inhalation, models with an enlarged olfactory recess would have slower rates of flow through the olfactory region (i.e. the olfactory recess plus airspace around the olfactory epithelium), while during exhalation these models would have little to no flow through the olfactory recess. To test these predictions, we experimentally modified the size of the olfactory recess while holding the rest of the morphology constant. During inhalation, we found that an enlarged olfactory recess resulted in lower rates of flow in the olfactory region. Upon exhalation, air flowed through the olfactory recess at a lower rate in the model with an enlarged olfactory recess. Taken together, these results indicate that an enlarged olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow during both inhalation and exhalation. These findings add to our growing understanding of how the morphology of the nasal cavity may relate to function in this understudied region of the skull."},{"title":"The limits of applicability of the sound exposure level (SEL) metric to temporal threshold shifts (TTS) in beluga whales, Delphinapterus leucas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1804","abstract":"The influence of fatiguing sound level and duration on post-exposure temporary threshold shift (TTS) was investigated in two beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas). The fatiguing sound was half-octave noise with a center frequency of 22.5 kHz. TTS was measured at a test frequency of 32 kHz. Thresholds were measured by recording rhythmic evoked potentials (the envelope following response) to a test series of short (eight cycles) tone pips with a pip rate of 1000 s−1. TTS increased approximately proportionally to the dB measure of both sound pressure (sound pressure level, SPL) and duration of the fatiguing noise, as a product of these two variables. In particular, when the noise parameters varied in a manner that maintained the product of squared sound pressure and time (sound exposure level, SEL, which is equivalent to the overall noise energy) at a constant level, TTS was not constant. Keeping SEL constant, the highest TTS appeared at an intermediate ratio of SPL to sound duration and decreased at both higher and lower ratios. Multiplication (SPL multiplied by log duration) better described the experimental data than an equal-energy (equal SEL) model. The use of SEL as a sole universal metric may result in an implausible assessment of the impact of a fatiguing sound on hearing thresholds in odontocetes, including under-evaluation of potential risks."},{"title":"A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M2 cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1745","abstract":"A novel potassium ion current induced by muscarinic stimulation (IKACh2) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, Carassius carassius; rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by application of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrations (10−7–10−4 mol l−1). It can be distinguished from the classic IKACh, activated by the βγ-subunit of the Gi-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba2+ ions and distinct current–voltage relationship with a very small inward current component. Ni2+ ions (5 mmol l−1) and KB-R7943 (10−5 mol l−1), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (INCX), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the IKACh2. Therefore, IKACh2 was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the INCX. However, the current is not affected by either exclusion of intracellular Na+ or extracellular Ca2+, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfusion with K+-free solution. Atropine (10−6 mol l−1), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the IKACh2. A selective antagonist of M2 cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10−7 mol l−1) and an M3 antagonist, 4-DAMP (10−9 mol l−1), decreased IKACh2 by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits Gi-protein coupled to M2 receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solution. It is concluded that IKACh2, induced by stimulation of M2 cholinoceptors and subsequent Gi-protein activation, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervation."},{"title":"Claudin-6, -10d and -10e contribute to seawater acclimation in the euryhaline puffer fish Tetraodon nigroviridis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1758","abstract":"Expression profiles of claudin-6, -10d and -10e in the euryhaline teleost fish Tetraodon nigroviridis revealed claudin-6 in brain, eye, gill and skin tissue, while claudin-10d and -10e were found in brain, gill and skin only. In fishes, the gill and skin are important tissue barriers that interface directly with surrounding water, but these organs generally function differently in osmoregulation. Therefore, roles for gill and skin claudin-6, -10d and -10e in the osmoregulatory strategies of T. nigroviridis were investigated. In the gill epithelium, claudin-6, -10d and -10e co-localized with Na+-K+-ATPase immunoreactive (NKA-ir) ionocytes, and differences in sub-cellular localization could be observed in hypoosmotic (freshwater, FW) versus hyperosmotic (seawater, SW) environments. Claudin-10d and -10e abundance increased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW versus FW, while claudin-6 abundance decreased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW. Taken together with our knowledge of claudin-6 and -10 function in other vertebrates, data support the idea that in SW-acclimated T. nigroviridis, these claudins are abundant in gill ionocytes, where they contribute to the formation of a Na+ shunt and ‘leaky’ epithelium, both of which are characteristic of salt-secreting SW fish gills. Skin claudin-10d and -10e abundance also increased in fish acclimated to SW versus those in FW, but so did claudin-6. In skin, claudin-6 was found to co-localize with NKA-ir cells, but claudin-10d and -10e did not. This study provides direct evidence that the gill epithelium contains salinity-responsive tight junction proteins that are abundant primarily in ionocytes. These same proteins also appear to play a role in the osmoregulatory physiology of the epidermis."},{"title":"Unique function of a chemosensory protein in the proboscis of two Helicoverpa species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1821","abstract":"Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are soluble proteins found only in arthropods. Some of them fill the lumen of chemosensilla and are believed to play a role similar to that of odorant-binding proteins in the detection of semiochemicals. Other members of the CSP family have been reported to perform different functions, from delivery of pheromones to development. This report is focused on a member (CSP4) of the family that is highly and almost exclusively present in the proboscis of two sibling noctuid species, Helicoverpa armigera and H. assulta. We expressed the protein in bacteria and measured binding to terpenoids and related compounds. Using specific antibodies, we found that when the moths suck on a sugar solution, CSP4 is partly extruded from the proboscis. A solution of protein can also fill a hydrophobic tube of same length and diameter as the proboscis by capillary action. On this basis, we suggest that CSP4 acts as a wetting agent to reduce the surface tension of aqueous solutions and consequently the pressure involved in sucking."},{"title":"Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, Bombyx mori","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1811","abstract":"Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, Bombyx mori, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a programmed walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (optic flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of optic flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as optic flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant optic flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the programmed walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of programmed behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of optic flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths."},{"title":"Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1656","abstract":"Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species."},{"title":"Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1682","abstract":"While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas."},{"title":"Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1667","abstract":"In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b and -32a transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and claudin-10c, -10d and -33b were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout."},{"title":"Olfactory foraging in temperate waters: sensitivity to dimethylsulphide of shearwaters in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1701","abstract":"Many procellariiforms use olfactory cues to locate food patches over the seemingly featureless ocean surface. In particular, some of them are able to detect and are attracted by dimethylsulphide (DMS), a volatile compound naturally occurring over worldwide oceans in correspondence with productive feeding areas. However, current knowledge is restricted to sub-Antarctic species and to only one study realized under natural conditions at sea. Here, for the first time, we investigated the response to DMS in parallel in two different environments in temperate waters, the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, employing Cory's (Calonectris borealis) and Scopoli's (Calonectris diomedea) shearwaters as models. To test whether these birds can detect and respond to DMS, we presented them with this substance in a Y-maze. Then, to determine whether they use this molecule in natural conditions, we tested the response to DMS at sea. The number of birds that chose DMS in the Y-maze and that were recruited at DMS-scented slicks at sea suggests that these shearwaters are attracted to DMS in both non-foraging and natural contexts. Our findings show that the use of DMS as a foraging cue may be a strategy adopted by procellariiforms across oceans but that regional differences may exist, giving a worldwide perspective to previous hypotheses concerning the use of DMS as a chemical cue."},{"title":"An acquired distaste: sugar discrimination by the larval parasitoid Microplitis croceipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is affected by prior sugar exposure","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1692","abstract":"We examined gustatory responses of the larval parasitoid Microplitis croceipes to determine whether the adults discriminate among common sugars, including fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose, found in plants. When given single sugar solutions of sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose at concentrations of 0.008–2.0 mol l−1, the estimated concentrations at which 50% of wasps initiated feeding ranged between 0.054 and 0.085 mol l−1 for sucrose, glucose and fructose, which was significantly lower than for maltose. Wasps showed a strong decrease in feeding time for maltose or fructose following a brief exposure to other sugars, suggesting that wasps can distinguish maltose and fructose from the other sugars tested. The higher acceptance threshold and short feeding time in the case of maltose appears adaptive in light of the relatively poor nutritional quality of the sugar in the longevity trial. The pronounced feeding inhibition seen for fructose following exposure to other sugars is not linked with lower nutritional performance. This feeding inhibition was even seen in wasps that had fed on glucose at the lowest acceptance threshold (0.031 mol l−1) and persisted for 24 h. This study is the first to show feeding inhibition of otherwise phagostimulant sugars such as maltose and fructose after gustatory stimulation on other sugars."},{"title":"Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic Varroa destructor mite infection of developing honey bee (Apis mellifera) pupae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1710","abstract":"The ectoparasitic Varroa destructor mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. Varroa interacts with honey bee viruses, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring viruses, immunosuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by Varroa has been proposed to explain the synergy between viruses and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee immune suppression by V. destructor is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced V. destructor mites on immune gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed wing virus in the developing bees. Our data on different immune genes show little evidence for immunosuppression of honey bees by V. destructor. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative immune gene expression and deformed wing virus titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not immunosuppression may contribute to the synergy between viruses and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee immune genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple immune genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee immune system."},{"title":"Artemin, a diapause-specific chaperone, contributes to the stress tolerance of Artemia franciscana cysts and influences their release from females","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1719","abstract":"Females of the crustacean Artemia franciscana produce either motile nauplii or gastrula stage embryos enclosed in a shell impermeable to nonvolatile compounds and known as cysts. The encysted embryos enter diapause, a state of greatly reduced metabolism and profound stress tolerance. Artemin, a diapause-specific ferritin homolog in cysts has molecular chaperone activity in vitro. Artemin represents 7.2% of soluble protein in cysts, approximately equal to the amount of p26, a small heat shock protein. However, there is almost twice as much artemin mRNA in cysts as compared with p26 mRNA, suggesting that artemin mRNA is translated less efficiently. RNA interference employing the injection of artemin double-stranded RNA into the egg sacs of A. franciscana females substantially reduced artemin mRNA and protein in cysts. Decreasing artemin diminished desiccation and freezing tolerance of cysts, demonstrating a role for this protein in stress resistance. Knockdown of artemin increased the time required for complete discharge of a brood of cysts carried within a female from a few hours up to 4 days, an effect weakened in successive broods. Artemin, an abundant molecular chaperone, contributes to stress tolerance of A. franciscana cysts while influencing their development and/or exit from females."},{"title":"Octopaminergic modulation of the visual flight speed regulator of Drosophila","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1737","abstract":"Recent evidence suggests that flies' sensitivity to large-field optic flow is increased by the release of octopamine during flight. This increase in gain presumably enhances visually mediated behaviors such as the active regulation of forward speed, a process that involves the comparison of a vision-based estimate of velocity with an internal set point. To determine where in the neural circuit this comparison is made, we selectively silenced the octopamine neurons in the fruit fly Drosophila, and examined the effect on vision-based velocity regulation in free-flying flies. We found that flies with inactivated octopamine neurons accelerated more slowly in response to visual motion than control flies, but maintained nearly the same baseline flight speed. Our results are parsimonious with a circuit architecture in which the internal control signal is injected into the visual motion pathway upstream of the interneuron network that estimates groundspeed."},{"title":"Mode of action of a Drosophila FMRFamide in inducing muscle contraction","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/10/1725","abstract":"Drosophila melanogaster is a model system for examining the mechanisms of action of neuropeptides. DPKQDFMRFamide was previously shown to induce contractions in Drosophila body wall muscle fibres in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The present study examined the possible involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor and second messengers in mediating this myotropic effect after removal of the central nervous system. DPKQDFMRFamide-induced contractions were reduced by 70% and 90%, respectively, in larvae with reduced expression of the Drosophila Fmrf receptor (FR) either ubiquitously or specifically in muscle tissue, compared with the response in control larvae in which expression was not manipulated. No such effect occurred in larvae with reduced expression of this gene only in neurons. The myogenic effects of DPKQDFMRFamide do not appear to be mediated through either of the two Drosophila myosuppressin receptors (DmsR-1 and DmsR-2). DPKQDFMRFamide-induced contractions were not reduced in Ala1 transgenic flies lacking activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamKII), and were not affected by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. Peptide-induced contractions in the mutants of the phospholipase C-β (PLCβ) gene (norpA larvae) and in IP3 receptor mutants were similar to contractions elicited in control larvae. The peptide failed to increase cAMP and cGMP levels in Drosophila body wall muscles. Peptide-induced contractions were not potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and were not antagonized by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Additionally, exogenous application of arachidonic acid failed to induce myogenic contractions. Thus, DPKQDFMRFamide induces contractions via a G-protein coupled FMRFamide receptor in muscle cells but does not appear to act via cAMP, cGMP, IP3, PLC, CaMKII or arachidonic acid."},{"title":"Heart rate as a predictor of metabolic rate in heterothermic bats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1519","abstract":"While heart rate (fH) has been used as an indicator of energy expenditure, quantitative data showing the relationship between these variables are only available for normothermic animals.

However, high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O2 delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O2 content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (N=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (N=9 and N=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O2 stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO."},{"title":"Activation of the cnidarian oxidative stress response by ultraviolet radiation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and crude oil","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1444","abstract":"Organisms are continuously exposed to reactive chemicals capable of causing oxidative stress and cellular damage. Antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases (SODs) and catalases, are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and provide an important means of neutralizing such oxidants. Studies in cnidarians have previously documented the occurrence of antioxidant enzymes (transcript expression, protein expression and/or enzymatic activity), but most of these studies have not been conducted in species with sequenced genomes or included phylogenetic analyses, making it difficult to compare results across species due to uncertainties in the relationships between genes. Through searches of the genome of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis Stephenson, one catalase gene and six SOD family members were identified, including three copper/zinc-containing SODs (CuZnSODs), two manganese-containing SODs (MnSODs) and one copper chaperone of SOD (CCS). In 24 h acute toxicity tests, juvenile N. vectensis showed enhanced sensitivity to combinations of ultraviolet radiation (UV) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, specifically pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene and fluoranthene) relative to either stressor alone. Adult N. vectensis exhibited little or no mortality following UV, benzo[a]pyrene or crude oil exposure but exhibited changes in gene expression. Antioxidant enzyme transcripts were both upregulated and downregulated following UV and/or chemical exposure. Expression patterns were most strongly affected by UV exposure but varied between experiments, suggesting that responses vary according to the intensity and duration of exposure. These experiments provide a basis for comparison with other cnidarian taxa and for further studies of the oxidative stress response in N. vectensis."},{"title":"Cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness is associated with diapause, but not the non-diapause developmental pathway, in the blow fly Calliphora vicina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1454","abstract":"Predicting insect responses to global climate change involves understanding cross-generation effects of temperature. The majority of temperate insects overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold hardiness. Diapause is often induced following maternal adult detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or generation. Continued global warming will expose adults to higher late-autumn temperatures, whilst diapause life stages will still experience prolonged winter cold. The cross-generation effect of temperature was investigated by acclimating adult Calliphora vicina to present-day (15°C) and future (20°C) late-autumn conditions and assessing cold-hardiness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness was associated with D but not ND larvae. D15 larvae exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=−18.9±0.9°C) compared with D20 (−15.3±0.8°C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to −4°C (LT50=26.0±1.0 and 11.4±1.1 days, respectively) and −8°C (5.1±1.1 and 3.0±1.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4±0.3 g mg−1) compared with D20 (3.0±0.3 g mg−1) larvae. In conclusion, C. vicina adults exposed to warmer autumn conditions during diapause induction will produce larvae with a reduced cold hardiness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival. Given that maternal regulation of diapause is common among temperate insects, this could be a widespread phenomenon."},{"title":"Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1469","abstract":"Perturbed colonies of Phenganax parrini and Sarcothelia sp. exhibit migration of symbionts of Symbiodinium spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone). Colonies of P. parrini, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. showed decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark, while colonies of P. parrini maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of Sarcothelia sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of Sarcothelia sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of Sarcothelia sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition."},{"title":"Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1462","abstract":"Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking males that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and physical environment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, Astatotilapia burtoni, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. Astatotilapia burtoni males are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local environment. Although dominant males are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on experience. We hypothesized that as males mature they might hone their fighting tactics based on observation of other males fighting. We compared males of different ages and sizes in distinctly different physical environments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing environmental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that males only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the physical complexity of the territory."},{"title":"Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1478","abstract":"Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Antioxidants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as antioxidants in vivo has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, Parus major, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis."},{"title":"Free-swimming northern elephant seals have low field metabolic rates that are sensitive to an increased cost of transport","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1485","abstract":"Widely ranging marine predators often adopt stereotyped, energy-saving behaviours to minimize the energetic cost of transport while maximizing energy gain. Environmental and anthropogenic disturbances can disrupt energy balance by prompting avoidance behaviours that increase transport costs, thereby decreasing foraging efficiency. We examined the ability of 12 free-ranging, juvenile northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) to mitigate the effects of experimentally increased transport costs by modifying their behaviour and/or energy use in a compensatory manner. Under normal locomotion, elephant seals had low energy requirements (106.5±28.2 kJ kg−1 day−1), approaching or even falling below predictions of basal requirements. Seals responded to a small increase in locomotion costs by spending more time resting between dives (149±44 s) compared with matched control treatments (102±11 s; P<0.01). Despite incurred costs, most other dive and transit behaviours were conserved across treatments, including fixed, rhythmic swimming gaits. Because of this, and because each flipper stroke had a predictable effect on total costs (P<0.001), total energy expenditure was strongly correlated with time spent at sea under both treatments (P<0.0001). These results suggest that transiting elephant seals have a limited capacity to modify their locomotory behaviour without increasing their transport costs. Based on this, we conclude that elephant seals and other ocean predators occupying similar niches may be particularly sensitive to increased transport costs incurred when avoiding unanticipated disturbances."},{"title":"High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1504","abstract":"Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative damage during reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in females of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR females showed higher oxidative damage to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR females. Reproduction did not affect oxidative damage to lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR females. Reproduction increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR females) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS."},{"title":"Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant Harpegnathos saltator","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1496","abstract":"Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant Harpegnathos saltator. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in H. saltator as well as drive differences in worker task performance."},{"title":"Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1510","abstract":"Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (Saxicola torquata). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against E. coli. We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest."},{"title":"Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1570","abstract":"In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle motion, with particle motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation."},{"title":"Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1555","abstract":"In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. In vitro studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation in vivo. Sea bream (Sparus aurata) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO3− equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation in vivo in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance."},{"title":"Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1563","abstract":"Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by Argiope aurantia, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, A. aurantia thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time."},{"title":"Seasonal accumulation of acetylated triacylglycerols by a freeze-tolerant insect","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1580","abstract":"Most animals store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs). Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in animals, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than lcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36% of the neutral lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis, while only 17% of the neutral lipid pool is made up of typical lcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by E. solidaginis and are not found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The mixture of acTAGs found in E. solidaginis has a significantly lower melting point than equivalent lcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at temperatures at which E. solidaginis is frozen in the field, and depresses the melting point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for neutral lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an animal, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs and lcTAGs during development and in response to stress."},{"title":"Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1588","abstract":"Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of Dosidicus gigas, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction increases propulsive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes."},{"title":"Changes in protein expression in the salt marsh mussel Geukensia demissa: evidence for a shift from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism during prolonged aerial exposure","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1601","abstract":"During aerial exposure (emersion), most sessile intertidal invertebrates experience cellular stress caused by hypoxia, and the amount and types of hypoxia-induced stress will differ as exposure time increases, likely leading to altered metabolic responses. We examined proteomic responses to increasing emersion times and decreasing recovery (immersion) times in the mussel Geukensia demissa, which occurs in salt marshes along the east coast of North America. Individuals are found above mean tide level, and can be emersed for over 18 h during spring tides. We acclimated mussels to full immersion at 15°C for 4 weeks, and compared changes in gill protein expression between groups of mussels that were continually immersed (control), were emersed for 6 h and immersed during recovery for 18 h (6E/18R), were emersed for 12 h and recovered for 12 h (12E/12R), or were emersed for 18 h with a 6 h recovery (18E/6R). We found clear differences in protein expression patterns among the treatments. Proteins associated with anaerobic fermentation increased in abundance in 6E/18R but not in 12E/12R or 18E/6R. Increases in oxidative stress proteins were most apparent in 12E/12R, and in 18E/6R changes in cytoskeletal protein expression predominated. We conclude that G. demissa alters its strategy for coping with emersion stress over time, relying on anaerobic metabolism for short- to medium-duration exposure, but switching to an air-gaping strategy for long-term exposure, which reduces hypoxia stress but may cause structural damage to gill tissue."},{"title":"Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1613","abstract":"Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus Symbiodinium) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the specificity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the specificity and timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under controlled laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic Symbiodinium strains, we found no difference in uptake specificity between larvae (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of detectable exchange with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, Aiptasia adults and larvae appear to have similar mechanisms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide a foundation for future analyses of the mechanisms of symbiont-uptake specificity in this emerging model system."},{"title":"The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1437","abstract":"The effects of flight behavior on physiology and senescence may be profound in insects because of the extremely high metabolic costs of flight. Flight capacity in insects decreases with age; in contrast, limiting flight behavior extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative damage in flight muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas mixture, and metabolic rate in Drosophila melanogaster. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were separated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no flight), (2) those allowed – but not forced – to fly (voluntary flight) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced flight). Flight capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-flight treatment, followed by the induced-flight group and then the voluntary flight group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-flight groups. Metabolic rate during agitated flight senesced earliest and most rapidly in the induced flight group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-flight group. Early senescence in the induced-flight group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the rapid accumulation of damage at the cellular level, while the early loss of flight capacity and low metabolic rates in the no-flight group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-insect performance."},{"title":"Bumblebees are not deterred by ecologically relevant concentrations of nectar toxins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1620","abstract":"Bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen that contain nutrients and simultaneously facilitate plant sexual reproduction. Paradoxically, nectar produced to attract pollinators often contains deterrent or toxic plant compounds associated with herbivore defence. The functional significance of these nectar toxins is not fully understood, but they may have a negative impact on pollinator behaviour and health, and, ultimately, plant pollination. This study investigates whether a generalist bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, can detect naturally occurring concentrations of nectar toxins. Using paired-choice experiments, we identified deterrence thresholds for five compounds found in the nectar of bee-pollinated plants: quinine, caffeine, nicotine, amygdalin and grayanotoxin. The deterrence threshold was determined when bumblebees significantly preferred a sucrose solution over a sucrose solution containing the compound. Bumblebees had the lowest deterrence threshold for the alkaloid quinine (0.01 mmol l−1); all other compounds had higher deterrence thresholds, above the natural concentration range in floral nectar. Our data, combined with previous work using honeybees, suggest that generalist bee species have poor acuity for the detection of nectar toxins. The fact that bees do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of these compounds likely indicates that it is difficult for them to learn to associate floral traits with the presence of toxins, thus maintaining this trait in plant populations."},{"title":"Recovery of otoacoustic emissions after high-level noise exposure in the American bullfrog","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1626","abstract":"The American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) has an amphibian papilla (AP) that senses airborne, low-frequency sound and generates distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) similar to other vertebrate species. Although ranid frogs are typically found in noisy environments, the effects of noise on the AP have not been studied. First, we determined the noise levels that diminished DPOAE at 2f1–f2 using an f2 stimulus level at 80 dB SPL and that also produced morphological damage of the sensory epithelium. Second, we compared DPOAE (2f1–f2) responses with histopathologic changes occurring in bullfrogs after noise exposure. Consistent morphological damage, such as fragmented hair cells and missing bundles, as well as elimination of DPOAE responses were seen only after very high-level (>150 dB SPL) sound exposures. The morphological response of hair cells to noise differed along the mediolateral AP axis: medial hair cells were sensitive to noise and lateral hair cells were relatively insensitive to noise. Renewed or repaired hair cells were not observed until 9 days post-exposure. Following noise exposure, DPOAE responses disappeared within 24 h and then recovered to normal pre-exposure levels within 3–4 days. Our results suggest that DPOAEs in the bullfrog are sensitive to the initial period of hair cell damage. After noise-induced damage, the bullfrog AP has functional recovery mechanisms that do not depend on substantial hair cell regeneration or repair. Thus, the bullfrog auditory system might serve as an interesting model for investigation of ways to prevent noise damage."},{"title":"Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1525","abstract":"Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of oxygen store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (fH) while diving. We investigated dive fH in five adult female California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive fH (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min−1) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min−1), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous fH below resting (<54 beats min−1) at some point during the dive. Both dive fH and minimum instantaneous fH significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous fH profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in fH resulting in the lowest instantaneous fH of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min−1 in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in fH to ~10–40 beats min−1 during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in fH during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, fH regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung oxygen store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound oxygen store, (c) conserve the blood oxygen store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This fH profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar fH profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration."},{"title":"Social attraction mediated by fruit flies' microbiome","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1346","abstract":"Larval and adult fruit flies are attracted to volatiles emanating from food substrates that have been occupied by larvae. We tested whether such volatiles are emitted by the larval gut bacteria by conducting tests under bacteria-free (axenic) conditions. We also tested attraction to two bacteria species, Lactobacillus brevis, which we cultured from larvae in our lab, and L. plantarum, a common constituent of fruit flies' microbiome in other laboratory populations and in wild fruit flies. Neither larvae nor adults showed attraction to axenic food that had been occupied by axenic larvae, but both showed the previously reported attraction to standard food that had been occupied by larvae with an intact microbiome. Larvae also showed significant attraction to volatiles from axenic food and larvae to which we added only either L. brevis or L. plantarum, and volatiles from L. brevis reared on its optimal growth medium. Controlled learning experiments indicated that larvae experienced with both standard and axenic used food do not perceive either as superior, while focal larvae experienced with simulated used food, which contains burrows, perceive it as superior to unused food. Our results suggest that flies rely on microbiome-derived volatiles for long-distance attraction to suitable food patches. Under natural settings, fruits often contain harmful fungi and bacteria, and both L. brevis and L. plantarum produce compounds that suppress the growth of some antagonistic fungi and bacteria. The larval microbiome volatiles may therefore lead prospective fruit flies towards substrates with a hospitable microbial environment."},{"title":"Female but not male zebra finches adjust heat output in response to increased incubation demand","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1326","abstract":"In many incubating birds, heat transfer from parent to egg is facilitated by the brood patch, an area of ventral abdominal skin that becomes highly vascularised, swells and loses its down feathers around the time of laying. Only the female develops a brood patch in most passerine species, but males of some species can incubate and maintain the eggs at similar temperatures to females even without a brood patch. Here we used a novel application of infrared thermography to examine sex differences in parental care from a physiological perspective. Using incubating male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), a species in which the male lacks a brood patch, we measured the surface temperature of the ventral plumage overlying the abdomen and a reference area that does not contact the eggs (thorax) twice per pair. In half of the pairs, clutch size was experimentally enlarged between the two sets of measurements to increase incubation demand. We found that the temperature differential between abdomen and thorax plumage was greater in females than in males, and that abdomen plumage was warmer after clutch enlargement than before in females but not in males. These findings are consistent with morphological sex differences in brood patch development and suggest that male and female zebra finches differ in the way they regulate abdomen versus general body surface temperature in response to variation in incubation demand."},{"title":"Role of axial muscles in powering mouth expansion during suction feeding in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1333","abstract":"Suction-feeding fishes capture food by fast and forceful expansion of the mouth cavity, and axial muscles probably provide substantial power for this feeding behavior. Dorsal expansion of the mouth cavity can only be powered by the epaxial muscles, but both the sternohyoid, shortening against an immobile pectoral girdle to retract the hyoid, and the hypaxial muscles, shortening to retract both the pectoral girdle and hyoid, could contribute ventral expansion power. To determine whether hypaxial muscles generate power for ventral expansion, and the rostrocaudal extent of axial muscle shortening during suction feeding, we measured skeletal kinematics and muscle shortening in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). The three-dimensional motions of the cleithrum and hyoid were measured with X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM), and muscle shortening was measured with fluoromicrometry, wherein changes in the distance between radio-opaque intramuscular markers are measured using biplanar X-ray video recording. We found that the hypaxials generated power for ventral suction expansion, shortening (mean of 6.2 mm) to rotate the pectoral girdle caudoventrally (mean of 9.3 deg) and retract the hyoid (mean of 8.5 mm). In contrast, the sternohyoid shortened minimally (mean of 0.48 mm), functioning like a ligament to transmit hypaxial shortening to the hyoid. Hypaxial and epaxial shortening were not confined to the rostral muscle regions, but extended more than halfway down the body during suction expansion. We conclude that hypaxial and epaxial muscles are both crucial for powering mouth expansion in largemouth bass, supporting the integration of axial and cranial musculoskeletal systems for suction feeding."},{"title":"Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1535","abstract":"Homeothermic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature (Tb) using heat produced by elevated metabolism, is energetically expensive. There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed Tb to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest-phase Tb. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during reproduction (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring metabolic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both reproductive and non-reproductive greater hedgehog tenrecs (Setifer setosus), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest metabolic rates and highest levels of Tb variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an increase in metabolism and Tb below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in Tb variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at ~25°C. However, whereas increases in resting metabolism were substantial below 20°C (up to 150% higher during reproduction), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, S. setosus provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in homeothermy could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for increases in thermogenesis during reproduction would have further benefited the development of homeothermy in mammals."},{"title":"Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, Calliphora vicina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/9/1543","abstract":"Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because oxygen transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O2 optode measurements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal PO2 is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO2 micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO2 is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the PO2 in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O2 by the transient accumulation of CO2 in the tracheal system before its release."},{"title":"Urea-based osmoregulation in the developing embryo of oviparous cartilaginous fish (Callorhinchus milii): contribution of the extraembryonic yolk sac during the early developmental period","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1353","abstract":"Marine cartilaginous fish retain a high concentration of urea to maintain the plasma slightly hyperosmotic to the surrounding seawater. In adult fish, urea is produced by hepatic and extrahepatic ornithine urea cycles (OUCs). However, little is known about the urea retention mechanism in developing cartilaginous fish embryos. In order to address the question as to the mechanism of urea-based osmoregulation in developing embryos, the present study examined the gene expression profiles of OUC enzymes in oviparous holocephalan elephant fish (Callorhinchus milii) embryos. We found that the yolk sac membrane (YSM) makes an important contribution to the ureosmotic strategy of the early embryonic period. The expression of OUC enzyme genes was detectable in the embryonic body from at least stage 28, and increased markedly during development to hatching, which is most probably due to growth of the liver. During the early developmental period, however, the expression of OUC enzyme genes was not prominent in the embryonic body. Meanwhile, we found that the mRNA expression of OUC enzymes was detected in the extra-embryonic YSM; the mRNA expression of cmcpsIII in the YSM was much higher than that in the embryonic body during stages 28–31. Significant levels of enzyme activity and the existence of mitochondrial-type cmgs1 transcripts in the YSM supported the mRNA findings. We also found that the cmcpsIII transcript is localized in the vascularized inner layer of the YSM. Taken together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that the YSM is involved in urea-based osmoregulation during the early to mid phase of development in oviparous cartilaginous fish."},{"title":"Summit metabolism and metabolic expansibility in Wahlberg's epauletted fruit bats (Epomophorus wahlbergi): seasonal acclimatisation and effects of captivity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1363","abstract":"Summit metabolism (Msum), the maximum rate of resting metabolic thermogenesis, has been found to be broadly correlated with climatic variables and the use of heterothermy in some endotherms. Far less is known about Msum and metabolic expansibility [ME, the ratio of Msum to basal metabolic rate (BMR)] in bats compared with many other endotherm taxa. We measured BMR and Msum during winter and summer in captive and wild populations of a pteropodid from the southern subtropics, Wahlberg's epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi) in Pretoria, South Africa. The Msum of fruit bats ranged from 5.178±0.611 W (captive, summer) to 6.006±0.890 W (captive, winter), and did not vary significantly between seasons. In contrast, BMR decreased by 17–25% in winter. The combination of seasonally stable Msum but flexible BMR resulted in ME being significantly higher in winter than in summer, ranging from 7.24±1.49 (wild, summer) to 13.11±2.14 (captive, winter). The latter value is well above the typical mammalian range. Moreover, both Msum and ME were significantly higher in captive bats than in wild individuals; we speculate this represents a phenotypic response to a reduction in exercise-associated heat production while in captivity. Our data for E. wahlbergi, combined with those currently available for other chiropterans, reveal that Msum in bats is highly variable compared with allometrically expected values for other mammals."},{"title":"Structured variability of steady-speed locomotion in rats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1402","abstract":"By examining key locomotor parameters during terrestrial locomotion on a substrate without irregularities, we show that rats frequently accelerate and decelerate between two consecutive steps while maintaining an overall steady speed and that the touchdown order of contralateral limbs significantly influences those speed adjustments. The latter highly correlates with significant adjustments in relative forelimb protraction at touchdown and hindlimb extension at lift-off. We conclude that this remarkable level of variability in limb coordination would clearly be advantageous for the functional flexibility needed during terrestrial locomotion on much more irregular (rough) natural terrain. In addition, its occurrence on a substrate lacking irregularities suggests that much of stable, terrestrial steady-speed locomotion in rats is mechanically controlled."},{"title":"Temperature during embryonic development has persistent effects on metabolic enzymes in the muscle of zebrafish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1370","abstract":"Global warming is intensifying interest in the physiological consequences of temperature change in ectotherms, but we still have a relatively poor understanding of the effects of temperature on early life stages. This study determined how embryonic temperature (TE) affects development and the activity of metabolic enzymes in the swimming muscle of zebrafish. Embryos developed successfully to hatching (survival ≥88%) from 22 to 32°C, but suffered sharp increases in mortality outside of this range. Embryos that were incubated until hatching at a control TE (27°C) or near the extremes for successful development (22 or 32°C) were next raised to adulthood under control conditions at 27°C. Growth trajectories after hatching were altered in the 22°C and 32°C TE groups compared with 27°C TE controls, but growth slowed after 3 months of age in all groups. Maximal enzyme activities of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), citrate synthase (CS), hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase (HOAD), pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured across a range of assay temperatures (22, 27, 32 and 36°C) in adults from each TE group that were acclimated to 27 or 32°C. Substrate affinities (Km) were also determined for COX and LDH. In adult fish acclimated to 27°C, COX and PK activities were higher in 22°C and 32°C TE groups than in 27°C TE controls, and the temperature optimum for COX activity was higher in the 32°C TE group than in the 22°C TE group. Warm acclimation reduced COX, CS and/or PK activities in the 22 and 32°C TE groups, possibly to compensate for thermal effects on molecular activity. This response did not occur in the 27°C TE controls, which instead increased LDH and HOAD activities. Warm acclimation also increased thermal sensitivity (Q10) of HOAD to cool temperatures across all TE groups. We conclude that the temperature experienced during early development can have a persistent impact on energy metabolism pathways and acclimation capacity in later life."},{"title":"Weakly electric fish display behavioral responses to envelopes naturally occurring during movement: implications for neural processing","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1381","abstract":"How the brain processes natural sensory input remains an important and poorly understood problem in neuroscience. The efficient coding hypothesis asserts that the brain's coding strategies are adapted to the statistics of natural stimuli in order to efficiently process them, thereby optimizing their perception by the organism. Here we examined whether gymnotiform weakly electric fish displayed behavioral responses that are adapted to the statistics of the natural electrosensory envelopes. Previous studies have shown that the envelopes resulting from movement tend to consist of low (<1 Hz) temporal frequencies and are behaviorally relevant whereas those resulting from social interactions consist of higher (>1 Hz) temporal frequencies that can thus mask more behaviorally relevant signals. We found that the self-generated electric organ discharge frequency follows the detailed time course of the envelope around a mean value that is positively offset with respect to its baseline value for temporal frequencies between 0.001 Hz and 1 Hz. The frequency-following component of this behavioral response decreased in magnitude as a power law as a function of the envelope frequency and was negligible for envelope frequencies above 1 Hz. In contrast, the offset component was relatively constant and somewhat increased for envelope frequencies above 1 Hz. Thus, our results show that weakly electric fish display behavioral responses that track the detailed time course of low but not high frequency envelope stimuli. Furthermore, we found that the magnitude of the frequency-following behavioral response matches, in a one-to-one fashion, the spectral power of natural second-order stimulus attributes observed during movement. Indeed, both decayed as a power law with the same exponent for temporal frequencies spanning three orders of magnitude. Thus, our findings suggest that the neural coding strategies used by weakly electric fish perceive the detailed time course of movement envelopes and are adapted to their statistics as found in the natural environment. They also suggest that weakly electric fish might take advantage of the differential frequency content of movement and social envelopes in order to give appropriate behavioral responses during encounters between two or more conspecifics."},{"title":"Regulation of the Rana sylvatica brevinin-1SY antimicrobial peptide during development and in dorsal and ventral skin in response to freezing, anoxia and dehydration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1392","abstract":"Brevinin-1SY is the only described antimicrobial peptide (AMP) of Rana sylvatica. As AMPs are important innate immune molecules that inhibit microbes, this study examined brevinin-1SY regulation during development and in adult frogs in response to environmental stress.

Brevinin-1SY was predicted to be an amphipathic, hydrophobic, alpha helical peptide that inserts into a lipid bilayer. Brevinin-1SY transcripts were detected in tadpoles and were significantly increased during the later stages of development. Effects of environmental stress (24 h anoxia, 40% dehydration or 24 h frozen) on the mRNA levels of brevinin-1SY in the dorsal and ventral skin were examined. The brevinin-1SY mRNA levels were increased in dorsal and ventral skin of dehydrated frogs, and in ventral skin of anoxic frogs, compared with controls (non-stressed). Brevinin-1SY protein levels in peptide extracts of dorsal skin showed a similar, but not significant, trend to that of brevinin-1SY mRNA levels. Antimicrobial activity of skin extracts from control and stressed animals were assessed for Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Botrytis cinerea, Rhizopus stolonifer and Pythium sulcatum using disk diffusion assays. Peptide extracts of dorsal skin from anoxic, frozen and dehydrated animals showed significantly higher inhibition of E. coli and P. sulcatum than from control animals. In ventral skin peptide extracts, significant growth inhibition was observed in frozen animals for E. coli and P. sulcatum, and in anoxic animals for B. cinerea, compared with controls.

Therefore, we aimed to determine how pineal melatonin synthesis is affected by exposing rainbow trout to different stressors, such as hypoxia, chasing and high stocking density. In addition, to test the hypothesis that cortisol is a mediator of such stress-induced effects, a set of animals were intraperitoneally implanted with coconut oil alone or containing cortisol (50 mg kg−1 body mass) and sampled 5 or 48 h post-injection at midday and midnight. The specificity of such effect was also assessed in cultured pineal organs exposed to cortisol alone or with the general glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone (RU486). Stress (in particular chasing and high stocking density) affected the patterns of plasma and pineal organ melatonin content during both day and night, with the greatest reduction occurring at night. The decrease in nocturnal melatonin levels in the pineal organ of stressed fish was accompanied by increased serotonin content and decreased AANAT2 enzymatic activity and mRNA abundance. Similar effects on pineal melatonin synthesis to those elicited by stress were observed in trout implanted with cortisol for either 5 or 48 h. These data indicate that stress negatively influences the synthesis of melatonin in the pineal organ, thus attenuating the day–night variations of circulating melatonin. The effect might be mediated by increased cortisol, which binds to trout pineal organ-specific glucocorticoid receptors to modulate melatonin rhythms. Our results in cultured pineal organs support this. Considering the role of melatonin in the synchronization of daily and annual rhythms, the results suggest that stress-induced alterations in melatonin synthesis could affect the availability of fish to integrate rhythmic environmental information."},{"title":"Characterisation of putative oxygen chemoreceptors in bowfin (Amia calva)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1269","abstract":"Serotonin containing neuroepithelial cells (NECs) are putative oxygen sensing cells found in different locations within the gills of fish.

We identified five different populations of serotonergic NECs in this species (Types I–V) based on location, presence of synaptic vesicles (SV) that stain for the antibody SV2, innervation and labelling with the neural crest marker HNK-1. Cell Types I–III were innervated, and these cells, which participate in central O2 chemoreflexes, were studied further. Although there was no change in the density of any cell type in bowfin after exposure to sustained hypoxia (6.0 kPa for 7 days) without access to air, all three of these cell types increased in size. In contrast, only Type II and III cells increased in size in bowfin exposed to sustained hypoxia with access to air. These data support the suggestion that NECs are putative oxygen-sensing cells, that they occur in several locations, and that Type I cells monitor only hypoxaemia, whereas both other cell types monitor hypoxia and hypoxaemia."},{"title":"Temperature and UV-B-insensitive performance in tadpoles of the ornate burrowing frog: an ephemeral pond specialist","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1246","abstract":"Animals may overcome the challenges of temperature instability through behavioural and physiological mechanisms in response to short- and long-term temperature changes. When ectotherms face the challenge of large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability (>20°C) and can be exposed to high levels of UV-B radiation. Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable temperature conditions in the presence of high or low UV-B radiation influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24°C) or fluctuating temperatures (18–32°C) under high or low UV-B conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits, thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing UV-B-induced damage may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures and UV-B exposure. Temperature treatment and UV-B exposure had an interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the thermal variability inherent in their environment."},{"title":"Impulsive ankle push-off powers leg swing in human walking","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1218","abstract":"Rapid unloading and a peak in power output of the ankle joint have been widely observed during push-off in human walking. Model-based studies hypothesize that this push-off causes redirection of the body center of mass just before touch-down of the leading leg. Other research suggests that work done by the ankle extensors provides kinetic energy for the initiation of swing. Also, muscle work is suggested to power a catapult-like action in late stance of human walking. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the biomechanical process leading to this widely observed high power output of the ankle extensors. In our study, we use kinematic and dynamic data of human walking collected at speeds between 0.5 and 2.5 m s−1 for a comprehensive analysis of push-off mechanics. We identify two distinct phases, which divide the push-off: first, starting with positive ankle power output, an alleviation phase, where the trailing leg is alleviated from supporting the body mass, and second, a launching phase, where stored energy in the ankle joint is released. Our results show a release of just a small part of the energy stored in the ankle joint during the alleviation phase. A larger impulse for the trailing leg than for the remaining body is observed during the launching phase. Here, the buckling knee joint inhibits transfer of power from the ankle to the remaining body. It appears that swing initiation profits from an impulsive ankle push-off resulting from a catapult without escapement."},{"title":"Spontaneous unraveling of hagfish slime thread skeins is mediated by a seawater-soluble protein adhesive","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1263","abstract":"Hagfishes are known for their ability to rapidly produce vast quantities of slime when provoked. The slime is formed via the interaction between seawater and two components released by the slime glands: mucin vesicles from gland mucous cells, which swell and rupture in seawater to form a network of mucus strands, and intermediate filament-rich threads, which are produced within gland thread cells as tightly coiled bundles called skeins. A previous study showed that the unraveling of skeins from Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) requires both the presence of mucins and hydrodynamic mixing. In contrast, skeins from Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) unravel in the absence of both mucins and mixing. We tested the hypothesis that spontaneous unraveling of E. stoutii skeins is triggered by the dissolution of a seawater-soluble protein adhesive and the release of stored strain energy within the coiled thread. Here we show that, as predicted by this hypothesis, unraveling can be initiated by a protease under conditions in which unraveling does not normally occur. We also demonstrate, using high resolution scanning electron microscopy, that the treatment of skeins with solutions that cause unraveling also leads to the disappearance of surface and inter-thread features that remain when skeins are washed with stabilizing solutions. Our study provides a mechanism for the deployment of thread skeins in Pacific hagfish slime, and raises the possibility of producing novel biomimetic protein adhesives that are salt, temperature and kosmotrope sensitive."},{"title":"Blood feeding induces hemocyte proliferation and activation in the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae Giles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1238","abstract":"Malaria is a global public health problem, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where the mosquito Anopheles gambiae Giles serves as the major vector for the protozoan Plasmodium falciparum Welch.

Applying novel technologies to the study of mosquito hemocytes, we investigated the effect of blood meal on hemocyte population dynamics, DNA replication and cell cycle progression. In contrast to prevailing published work, the data presented here demonstrate that hemocytes in adult mosquitoes continue to undergo low basal levels of replication. In addition, blood ingestion caused significant changes in hemocytes within 24 h. Hemocytes displayed an increase in cell number, size, granularity and Ras-MAPK signaling as well as altered cell surface moieties. As these changes are well-known markers of immune cell activation in mammals and Drosophila melanogaster Meigen, we further investigated whether a blood meal changes the expression of hemocyte-derived immune factors. Indeed, hemocytes 24 h post-blood meal displayed higher levels of critical components of the complement and melanization immune reactions in mosquitoes. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the normal physiological process of a blood meal activates the innate immune response in mosquitoes. This process is likely in part regulated by Ras-MAPK signaling, highlighting a novel mechanistic link between blood feeding and immunity."},{"title":"Differential effects of specific carotenoids on oxidative damage and immune response of gull chicks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1253","abstract":"Micronutrients are essential for normal metabolic processes during early development. Specifically, it has been suggested that diet-derived carotenoids can play a key role in physiological functions because of their antioxidant and immunostimulant properties. However, their role as antioxidants remains controversial. Additionally, it is also unclear whether oxidative stress mediates their immunostimulatory effects. In this field study, we separately supplemented yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) chicks with two carotenoids (lutein and β-carotene) with different molecular structures and different transformation pathways into other oxidative forms of carotenoids. We quantified their effect on the oxidative status and the immune response of chicks before and after an oxidative challenge with paraquat, a pro-oxidant molecule. Prior to oxidative challenge, none of the carotenoid treatments affected the oxidative status of chicks, but they enhanced the inflammatory response to an antigen compared with controls. The oxidative challenge enhanced plasma vitamin E levels (but not in β-carotene-supplemented chicks) and the antioxidant capacity in the short term. Interestingly, lutein-supplemented chicks showed lower oxidative damage to proteins than non-lutein-supplemented chicks. After the oxidative challenge, the positive effect of carotenoid supplementation on the immune response disappeared. Thus, these results suggest differential effects of two carotenoids with different molecular structures on the oxidative status. Lutein but not β-carotene helps to combat oxidative damage after a free-radical exposure. Additionally, the results indicate that the immunostimulatory effects of carotenoids are linked to oxidative status during early life."},{"title":"Honeybee drones are attracted by groups of consexuals in a walking simulator","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1278","abstract":"During the mating season, honeybee males, the drones, gather in congregation areas 10–40 m above ground. When a receptive female, a queen, enters the congregation, drones are attracted to her by queen-produced pheromones and visual cues and attempt to mate with the queen in mid-air. It is still unclear how drones and queens find the congregations. Visual cues on the horizon are most probably used for long-range orientation. For shorter-range orientation, however, attraction by a drone-produced aggregation pheromone has been proposed, yet so far its existence has not been confirmed conclusively. The low accessibility of congregation areas high up in the air is a major hurdle and precise control of experimental conditions often remains unsatisfactory in field studies. Here, we used a locomotion compensator-based walking simulator to investigate drones' innate odor preferences under controlled laboratory conditions. We tested behavioral responses of drones to 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid (9-ODA), the major queen-produced sexual attractant, and to queen mandibular pheromone (QMP), an artificial blend of 9-ODA and several other queen-derived components. While 9-ODA strongly dominates the odor bouquet of virgin queens, QMP rather resembles the bouquet of mated queens. In our assay, drones were attracted by 9-ODA, but not by QMP. We also investigated the potential attractiveness of male-derived odors by testing drones' orientation responses to the odor bouquet of groups of 10 living drones or workers. Our results demonstrate that honeybee drones are attracted by groups of other drones (but not by workers), which may indicate a role of drone-emitted cues for the formation of congregations."},{"title":"Why do insects enter and recover from chill coma? Low temperature and high extracellular potassium compromise muscle function in Locusta migratoria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1297","abstract":"When exposed to low temperatures, many insect species enter a reversible comatose state (chill coma), which is driven by a failure of neuromuscular function. Chill coma and chill coma recovery have been associated with a loss and recovery of ion homeostasis (particularly extracellular [K+], [K+]o) and accordingly onset of chill coma has been hypothesized to result from depolarization of membrane potential caused by loss of ion homeostasis. Here, we examined whether onset of chill coma is associated with a disturbance in ion balance by examining the correlation between disruption of ion homeostasis and onset of chill coma in locusts exposed to cold at varying rates of cooling. Chill coma onset temperature changed maximally 1°C under different cooling rates and marked disturbances of ion homeostasis were not observed at any of the cooling rates. In a second set of experiments, we used isolated tibial muscle to determine how temperature and [K+]o, independently and together, affect tetanic force production. Tetanic force decreased by 80% when temperature was reduced from 23°C to 0.5°C, while an increase in [K+]o from 10 mmol l−1 to 30 mmol l−1 at 23°C caused a 40% reduction in force. Combining these two stressors almost abolished force production. Thus, low temperature alone may be responsible for chill coma entry, rather than a disruption of extracellular K+ homeostasis. As [K+] also has a large effect on tetanic force production, it is hypothesized that recovery of [K+]o following chill coma could be important for the time to recovery of normal neuromuscular function."},{"title":"The smell of moulting: N-acetylglucosamino-1,5-lactone is a premoult biomarker and candidate component of the courtship pheromone in the urine of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1286","abstract":"Female blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) in their pubertal moult stage release unidentified sex pheromone molecules in their urine, causing males to respond with courtship behaviours including a display called courtship stationary paddling and a form of precopulatory guarding called cradle carry. We hypothesized that pheromones are mixtures of molecules and are more concentrated in urine of pubertal premoult females compared with other moulting stages and thus that these molecules are biomarkers (i.e. metabolites that can be used as an indicator of some biological state or condition) of pubertal premoult females. We tested this hypothesis by combining bioassay-guided fractionation and biomarker targeting. To evaluate the molecular mass of the putative pheromone by bioassay-guided fractionation, we separated urine from pubertal premoult females and intermoult males by ultrafiltration into three molecular mass fractions. The <500 Da fraction and the 500–1000 Da fraction but not the >1000 Da fraction of female urine induced male courtship stationary paddling, but none of the fractions of male urine did. Thus, female urine contains molecules of <1000 Da that stimulate courtship behaviours in males. Biomarker targeting using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral analysis of the 500–1000 Da fraction of urine from premoult and postmoult males and females revealed a premoult biomarker. Purification, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry and high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of this premoult biomarker identified it as N-acetylglucosamino-1,5-lactone (NAGL) and showed that it is more abundant in urine of premoult females and males than in urine of either postmoult or juvenile females and males. NAGL has not been reported before as a natural product or as a molecule of the chitin metabolic pathway. Physiological and behavioural experiments demonstrated that blue crabs can detect NAGL through their olfactory pathway. Thus, we hypothesize that NAGL is a component of the sex pheromone and that it acts in conjunction with other yet unidentified components."},{"title":"Measuring individual locomotor rhythms in honey bees, paper wasps and other similar-sized insects","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1307","abstract":"Circadian rhythms in social insects are highly plastic and are modulated by multiple factors. In addition, complex behaviors such as sun-compass orientation and time learning are clearly regulated by the circadian system in these organisms. Despite these unique features of social insect clocks, the mechanisms as well as the functional and evolutionary relevance of these traits remain largely unknown. Here we show a modification of the Drosophila activity monitoring (DAM) system that allowed us to measure locomotor rhythms of the honey bee, Apis mellifera (three variants; gAHB, carnica and caucasica), and two paper wasps (Polistes crinitus and Mischocyttarus phthisicus). A side-by-side comparison of the endogenous period under constant darkness (free-running period) led us to the realization that these social insects exhibit significant deviations from the Earth's 24 h rotational period as well as a large degree of inter-individual variation compared with Drosophila. Experiments at different temperatures, using honey bees as a model, revealed that testing the endogenous rhythm at 35°C, which is the hive's core temperature, results in average periods closer to 24 h compared with 25°C (23.8 h at 35°C versus 22.7 h at 25°C). This finding suggests that the degree of tuning of circadian temperature compensation varies among different organisms. We expect that the commercial availability, cost-effectiveness and integrated nature of this monitoring system will facilitate the growth of the circadian field in these social insects and catalyze our understanding of the mechanisms as well as the functional and evolutionary relevance of circadian rhythms."},{"title":"The evolution of micro-cursoriality in mammals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1316","abstract":"In this study we report on the evolution of micro-cursoriality, a unique case of cursoriality in mammals smaller than 1 kg. We obtained new running speed and limb morphology data for two species of elephant-shrews (Elephantulus spp., Macroscelidae) from Namaqualand, South Africa, which we compared with published data for other mammals. Elephantulus maximum running speeds were higher than those of most mammals smaller than 1 kg. Elephantulus also possess exceptionally high metatarsal:femur ratios (1.07) that are typically associated with fast unguligrade cursors. Cursoriality evolved in the Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla and Carnivora coincident with global cooling and the replacement of forests with open landscapes in the Oligocene and Miocene. The majority of mammal species, though, remained non-cursorial, plantigrade and small (<1 kg). The extraordinary running speed and digitigrady of elephant-shrews was established in the Early Eocene in the earliest macroscelid Prodiacodon, but was probably inherited from Paleocene, Holarctic stem macroscelids. Micro-cursoriality in macroscelids evolved from the plesiomorphic plantigrade foot of the possum-like ancestral mammal earlier than in other mammalian crown groups. Micro-cursoriality evolved first in forests, presumably in response to selection for rapid running speeds facilitated by local knowledge, in order to avoid predators. During the Miocene, micro-cursoriality was pre-adaptive to open, arid habitats, and became more derived in the newly evolved Elephantulus and Macroscelides elephant-shrews with trail running."},{"title":"Evidence for vocal learning in juvenile male killer whales, Orcinus orca, from an adventitious cross-socializing experiment","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/8/1229","abstract":"Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are thought to learn their vocal dialect. Dispersal in the species is rare, but effects of shifts in social association on the dialect can be studied under controlled conditions. Individual call repertoires and social association were measured in three adult female killer whales and three males (two juveniles and an adult) during two periods, 2001–2003 and 2005–2006. Three distinct dialect repertoires were represented among the subjects. An adventitious experiment in social change resulted from the birth of a calf and the transfer of two non-focal subjects in 2004. Across the two periods, 1691 calls were collected, categorized and attributed to individuals. Repertoire overlap for each subject dyad was compared with an index of association. During 2005–2006, the two juvenile males increased association with the unrelated adult male. By the end of the period, both had begun producing novel calls and call features characteristic of his repertoire. However, there was little or no reciprocal change and the adult females did not acquire his calls. Repertoire overlap and association were significantly correlated in the first period. In the second, median association time and repertoire similarity increased, but the relationship was only marginally significant. The results provided evidence that juvenile male killer whales are capable of learning new call types, possibly stimulated by a change in social association. The pattern of learning was consistent with a selective convergence of male repertoires."},{"title":"Glucose overload in yolk has little effect on the long-term modulation of carbohydrate metabolic genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1139","abstract":"Some fish show a low metabolic ability to use dietary carbohydrates. The use of early nutritional stimuli to program metabolic pathways in fish is ill defined. Therefore, studies were undertaken with zebrafish to assess the effect of high glucose levels during the embryonic stage as a lifelong modulator of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Genes related to carbohydrate metabolism were expressed at low levels at 0.2 and 1 day post-fertilization (dpf). However, from 4 dpf onwards there was a significant increase on expression of all genes, suggesting that all analysed pathways were active. By microinjection, we successfully enriched zebrafish egg yolk with glucose (a 43-fold increase of basal levels). Acute effects of glucose injection on gene expression were assessed in larvae up to 10 dpf, and the programming concept was evaluated in juveniles (41 dpf) challenged with a hyperglucidic diet. At 4 dpf, larvae from glucose-enriched eggs showed a downregulation of several genes related to glycolysis, glycogenolysis, lipogenesis and carbohydrate digestion in comparison with control (saline-injected) embryos. This inhibitory regulation was suppressed after 10 dpf. At the juvenile stage, and upon switching from a low to a high digestible carbohydrate diet, early glucose enrichment had no significant effect on most analysed genes. However, these same fish showed altered expression of the genes for cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 1 and glycogen synthase, suggesting changes to the glucose storage capacity in muscle and glucose production and transport in viscera. Overall, supplementation of egg yolk with high glucose levels had little effect on the long-term modulation of carbohydrate metabolic genes in zebrafish."},{"title":"Common effect of the mucus transferred during mating in two dart-shooting snail species from different families","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1150","abstract":"Several taxa of pulmonate land snails exhibit a conspicuous mating behaviour, the shooting of so-called love darts. During mating, such land snail species stab a mating partner with a mucus-coated dart. It has previously been shown that the sperm donor physiologically influences the sperm recipient via the mucus covering the dart and thereby decreases the number of sperm digested by the recipient. However, the generality of this effect of the dart's mucus is unclear, because almost all the previous studies on the effect of the mucus used the brown garden snail Cornu aspersum from the family Helicidae. Therefore, the relationship between the acquisition of the mucus effect on the recipient and the evolution of the dart itself, and its mucus, is still open to debate. To test the commonality of the physiological effect of the dart mucus, we examined this in Euhadra peliomphala, a species from the Bradybaenidae family, and compared our findings with the results of previous work using C. aspersum. Our experiments showed that in E. peliomphala, the dart mucus had a physiological effect and lowered the accessibility of the gametolytic organ, as found in C. aspersum. This indicates that in various dart-bearing species the mucus from the dart glands targets the same organ and that the inhibition of sperm digestion has played a crucial role in the evolution of the dart and its mucus."},{"title":"A comparative analysis of marine mammal tracheas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1154","abstract":"In 1940, Scholander suggested that stiffened upper airways remained open and received air from highly compressible alveoli during marine mammal diving. There are few data available on the structural and functional adaptations of the marine mammal respiratory system. The aim of this research was to investigate the anatomical (gross) and structural (compliance) characteristics of excised marine mammal tracheas. Here, we defined different types of tracheal structures, categorizing pinniped tracheas by varying degrees of continuity of cartilage (categories 1–4) and cetacean tracheas by varying compliance values (categories 5A and 5B). Some tracheas fell into more than one category along their length; for example, the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) demonstrated complete rings cranially, and as the trachea progressed caudally, tracheal rings changed morphology. Dolphins and porpoises had less stiff, more compliant spiraling rings while beaked whales had very stiff, less compliant spiraling rings. The pressure–volume (P–V) relationships of isolated tracheas from different species were measured to assess structural differences between species. These findings lend evidence for pressure-induced collapse and re-inflation of lungs, perhaps influencing variability in dive depth or ventilation rates of the species investigated."},{"title":"Biomechanical consequences of epiphytism in intertidal macroalgae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1167","abstract":"Epiphytic algae grow on other algae rather than hard substrata, perhaps circumventing competition for space in marine ecosystems. Aquatic epiphytes are widely thought to negatively affect host fitness; it is also possible that epiphytes benefit from associating with hosts. This study explored the biomechanical costs and benefits of the epiphytic association between the intertidal brown algal epiphyte Soranthera ulvoidea and its red algal host Odonthalia floccosa. Drag on epiphytized and unepiphytized hosts was measured in a recirculating water flume. A typical epiphyte load increased drag on hosts by ~50%, increasing dislodgment risk of epiphytized hosts compared with hosts that did not have epiphytes. However, epiphytes were more likely to dislodge from hosts than hosts were to dislodge from the substratum, suggesting that drag added by epiphytes may not be mechanically harmful to hosts if epiphytes break first. Concomitantly, epiphytes experienced reduced flow when attached to hosts, perhaps allowing them to grow larger or live in more wave-exposed areas. Biomechanical interactions between algal epiphytes and hosts are complex and not necessarily negative, which may partially explain the evolution and persistence of epiphytic relationships."},{"title":"Reflectance-based identification of parasitized host eggs and adult Trichogramma specimens","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1187","abstract":"A wide range of imaging and spectroscopy technologies is used in medical diagnostics, quality control in production systems, military applications, stress detection in agriculture, and ecological studies of both terrestrial and aquatic organisms. In this study, we hypothesized that reflectance profiling can be used to successfully classify animals that are otherwise very challenging to classify. We acquired hyperspectral images from adult specimens of the egg parasitoid genus Trichogramma (T. galloi, T. pretiosum and T. atopovirilia), which are ~1.0 mm in length. We also acquired hyperspectral images from host eggs containing developing Trichogramma instar and pupae. These obligate egg endoparasitoid species are commercially available as natural enemies of lepidopteran pests in food production systems. Because of their minute size and physical resemblance, classification is time consuming and requires a high level of technical experience. The classification of reflectance profiles was based on a combination of average reflectance and variogram parameters (describing the spatial structure of reflectance data) of reflectance values in individual spectral bands. Although variogram parameters (variogram analysis) are commonly used in large-scale spatial research (i.e. geoscience and landscape ecology), they have only recently been used in classification of high-resolution hyperspectral imaging data. The classification model of parasitized host eggs was equally successful for each of the three species and was successfully validated with independent data sets (>90% classification accuracy). The classification model of adult specimens accurately separated T. atopovirilia from the other two species, but specimens of T. galloi and T. pretiosum could not be accurately separated. Interestingly, molecular-based classification (using the DNA sequence of the internally transcribed spacer ITS2) of Trichogramma species published elsewhere corroborates the classification, as T. galloi and T. pretiosum are closely related and comparatively distant from T. atopovirilia. Our results emphasize the importance of using high-spectral and high-spatial resolution data in the classification of organism relatedness, and hyperspectral imaging may be of relevance to a wide range of commercial (i.e. producers of biocontrol agents), taxonomic and evolutionary research applications."},{"title":"Calcium uptake in aquatic insects: influences of phylogeny and metals (Cd and Zn)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1180","abstract":"Calcium sequestration in the hypo-osmotic freshwater environment is imperative in maintaining calcium homeostasis in freshwater aquatic organisms. This uptake process is reported to have the unintended consequence of potentially toxic heavy metal (Cd, Zn) uptake in a variety of aquatic species. However, calcium uptake remains poorly understood in aquatic insects, the dominant invertebrate faunal group in most freshwater ecosystems. Here, we examined Ca uptake and interactions with heavy metals (Cd, Zn) at low ambient Ca levels (12.5 μmol l−1) in 12 aquatic insect species within Ephemerellidae (mayfly) and Hydropsychidae (caddisfly), two families differentially responsive to trace metal pollution. We found Ca uptake varied 70-fold across the 12 species studied. Body mass and clade (family) were found to significantly influence both Ca uptake and adsorption (P≤0.05). Zn and Cd uptake rate constants (ku) exhibited a strong correlation (r=0.96, P<0.0001), suggesting a shared transport system. Ca uptake failed to significantly correlate with either Zn or Cd ku values. Further, neither Zn nor Cd exhibited inhibitory effects toward Ca uptake. In fact, we saw evidence of modest stimulation of Ca uptake rates in some metal treatments. This work suggests that insects generally differ from other freshwater taxa in that aqueous Ca uptake does not appear to be compromised by Cd or Zn exposure. It is important to understand the trace metal and major ion physiology of aquatic insects because of their ecological importance and widespread use as ecological indicators."},{"title":"Adult fruit fly attraction to larvae biases experience and mediates social learning","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1193","abstract":"We investigated whether adult fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) use cues of larvae as social information in their food patch choice decisions. Adult male and female fruit flies showed attraction to odours emanating from foraging larvae, and females preferred to lay eggs on food patches occupied by larvae over similar unoccupied patches. Females learned and subsequently preferred to lay eggs at patches with novel flavours previously associated with feeding larvae over patches with novel flavours previously associated with no larvae. However, when we controlled for the duration of exposure to each flavoured patch, females no longer preferred the flavour previously associated with feeding larvae. This suggests that social learning in this context is indirect, as a result of strong social attraction biasing experience."},{"title":"Master of all trades: thermal acclimation and adaptation of cardiac function in a broadly distributed marine invasive species, the European green crab, Carcinus maenas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1129","abstract":"As global warming accelerates, there is increasing concern about how ecosystems may change as a result of species loss and replacement. Here, we examined the thermal physiology of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas Linnaeus 1758), a globally invasive species, along three parallel thermal gradients in its native and invasive ranges. At each site, we assessed cardiac physiology to determine heat and cold tolerance and acclimatory plasticity. We found that, overall, the species is highly tolerant of both heat and cold, and that it survives higher temperatures than co-occurring native marine crustaceans. Further, we found that both heat and cold tolerance are plastic in response to short-term acclimation (18–31 days at either 5 or 25°C). Comparing patterns within ranges, we found latitudinal gradients in thermal tolerance in the native European range and in the invasive range in eastern North America. This pattern is strongest in the native range, and likely evolved there. Because of a complicated invasion history, the latitudinal pattern in the eastern North American invasive range may be due either to rapid adaptation post-invasion or to adaptive differences between the ancestral populations that founded the invasion. Overall, the broad thermal tolerance ranges of green crabs, which may facilitate invasion of novel habitats, derive from high inherent eurythermality and acclimatory plasticity and potentially adaptive differentiation among populations. The highly flexible physiology that results from these capacities may represent the hallmark of a successful invasive species, and may provide a model for success in a changing world."},{"title":"Geographical differences in maternal basking behaviour and offspring growth rate in a climatically widespread viviparous reptile","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1175","abstract":"In reptiles, the thermal environment during embryonic development affects offspring phenotypic traits and potentially offspring fitness. In viviparous species, mothers can potentially manipulate the embryonic thermal environment through their basking behaviour and, thus, may be able to manipulate offspring phenotype and increase offspring fitness. One way in which mothers can maximise offspring phenotype (and thus potentially affect offspring fitness) is by fine-tuning their basking behaviour to the environment in order to buffer the embryo from deleterious developmental temperatures. In widespread species, it is unclear whether populations that have evolved under different climatic conditions will exhibit different maternal behaviours and/or thermal effects on offspring phenotype. To test this, we provided extended or reduced basking opportunity to gravid spotted skinks (Niveoscincus ocellatus) and their offspring from two populations at the climatic extremes of the species' distribution. Gravid females fine-tuned their basking behaviour to the basking opportunity, which allowed them to buffer their embryos from potentially negative thermal effects. This fine-tuning of female basking behaviour appears to have led to the expression of geographical differences in basking behaviour, with females from the cold alpine regions being more opportunistic in their basking behaviour than females from the warmer regions. However, those differences in maternal behaviour did not preclude the evolution of geographic differences in thermal effects: offspring growth varied between populations, potentially suggesting local adaptation to basking conditions. Our results demonstrate that maternal effects and phenotypic plasticity can play a significant role in allowing species to cope in changing environmental conditions, which is particularly relevant in the context of climate change."},{"title":"Biophysics of directional hearing in the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1094","abstract":"Physiological and anatomical studies have suggested that alligators have unique adaptations for spatial hearing. Sound localization cues are primarily generated by the filtering of sound waves by the head. Different vertebrate lineages have evolved external and/or internal anatomical adaptations to enhance these cues, such as pinnae and interaural canals. It has been hypothesized that in alligators, directionality may be enhanced via the acoustic coupling of middle ear cavities, resulting in a pressure difference receiver (PDR) mechanism. The experiments reported here support a role for a PDR mechanism in alligator sound localization by demonstrating that (1) acoustic space cues generated by the external morphology of the animal are not sufficient to generate location cues that match physiological sensitivity, (2) continuous pathways between the middle ears are present to provide an anatomical basis for coupling, (3) the auditory brainstem response shows some directionality, and (4) eardrum movement is directionally sensitive. Together, these data support the role of a PDR mechanism in crocodilians and further suggest this mechanism is a shared archosaur trait, most likely found also in the extinct dinosaurs."},{"title":"Decreased hydrogen peroxide production and mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle but not cardiac muscle of the green-striped burrowing frog, a natural model of muscle disuse","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1087","abstract":"Suppression of disuse-induced muscle atrophy has been associated with altered mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mammals. However, despite extended hindlimb immobility, aestivating animals exhibit little skeletal muscle atrophy compared with artificially immobilised mammalian models. Therefore, we studied mitochondrial respiration and ROS (H2O2) production in permeabilised muscle fibres of the green-striped burrowing frog, Cyclorana alboguttata. Mitochondrial respiration within saponin-permeabilised skeletal and cardiac muscle fibres was measured concurrently with ROS production using high-resolution respirometry coupled to custom-made fluorometers. After 4 months of aestivation, C. alboguttata had significantly depressed whole-body metabolism by ~70% relative to control (active) frogs, and mitochondrial respiration in saponin-permeabilised skeletal muscle fibres decreased by almost 50% both in the absence of ADP and during oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial ROS production showed up to an 88% depression in aestivating skeletal muscle when malate, succinate and pyruvate were present at concentrations likely to reflect those in vivo. The percentage ROS released per O2 molecule consumed was also ~94% less at these concentrations, indicating an intrinsic difference in ROS production capacities during aestivation. We also examined mitochondrial respiration and ROS production in permeabilised cardiac muscle fibres and found that aestivating frogs maintained respiratory flux and ROS production at control levels. These results show that aestivating C. alboguttata has the capacity to independently regulate mitochondrial function in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Furthermore, this work indicates that ROS production can be suppressed in the disused skeletal muscle of aestivating frogs, which may in turn protect against potential oxidative damage and preserve skeletal muscle structure during aestivation and following arousal."},{"title":"Biomechanical strategies for mitigating collision damage in insect wings: structural design versus embedded elastic materials","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1108","abstract":"The wings of many insects accumulate considerable wear and tear during their lifespan, and this irreversible structural damage can impose significant costs on insect flight performance and survivability. Wing wear in foraging bumblebees (and likely many other species) is caused by inadvertent, repeated collisions with vegetation during flight, suggesting the possibility that insect wings may display biomechanical adaptations to mitigate the damage associated with collisions. We used a novel experimental technique to artificially induce wing wear in bumblebees and yellowjacket wasps, closely related species with similar life histories but distinct wing morphologies. Wasps have a flexible resilin joint (the costal break) positioned distally along the leading edge of the wing, which allows the wing tip to crumple reversibly when it hits an obstacle, whereas bumblebees lack an analogous joint. Through experimental manipulation of its stiffness, we found that the costal break plays a critical role in mitigating collision damage in yellowjacket wings. However, bumblebee wings do not experience as much damage as would be expected based on their lack of a costal break, possibly due to differences in the spatial arrangement of supporting wing veins. Our results indicate that these two species utilize different wing design strategies for mitigating damage resulting from collisions. A simple inertial model of a flapping wing reveals the biomechanical constraints acting on the costal break, which may help explain its absence in bumblebee wings."},{"title":"Suspended sediment prolongs larval development in a coral reef fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1122","abstract":"Increasing sediment input into coastal environments is having a profound influence on shallow marine habitats and associated species. Coral reef ecosystems appear to be particularly sensitive, with increased sediment deposition and re-suspension being associated with declines in the abundance and diversity of coral reef fishes. While recent research has demonstrated that suspended sediment can have negative impacts on post-settlement coral reef fishes, its effect on larval development has not been investigated. In this study, we tested the effects of different levels of suspended sediment on larval growth and development time in Amphiprion percula, a coral reef damselfish. Larvae were subjected to four experimental concentrations of suspended sediment spanning the range found around coastal coral reefs (0–45 mg l−1). Larval duration was significantly longer in all sediment treatments (12 days) compared with the average larval duration in the control treatment (11 days). Approximately 75% of the fish in the control had settled by day 11, compared with only 40–46% among the sediment treatments. In the highest sediment treatment, some individuals had a larval duration twice that of the median duration in the control treatment. Unexpectedly, in the low sediment treatment, fish at settlement were significantly longer and heavier compared with fish in the other treatments, suggesting delayed development was independent of individual condition. A sediment-induced extension of the pelagic larval stage could significantly reduce numbers of larvae competent to settle and, in turn, have major effects on adult population dynamics."},{"title":"Melatonin action in a midbrain vocal-acoustic network","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1046","abstract":"Melatonin is a well-documented time-keeping hormone that can entrain an individual's physiology and behavior to the day–night cycle, though surprisingly little is known about its influence on the neural basis of social behavior, including vocalization. Male midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) produce several call types distinguishable by duration and by daily and seasonal cycles in their production. We investigated melatonin's influence on the known nocturnal- and breeding season-dependent increase in excitability of the midshipman's vocal network (VN) that directly patterns natural calls. VN output is readily recorded from the vocal nerve as a ‘fictive call’. Five days of constant light significantly increased stimulus threshold levels for calls electrically evoked from vocally active sites in the medial midbrain, supporting previous findings that light suppresses VN excitability, while 2-iodomelatonin (2-IMel; a melatonin analog) implantation decreased threshold. 2-IMel also increased fictive call duration evoked from medial sites as well as lateral midbrain sites that produced several-fold longer calls irrespective of photoregime or drug treatment. When stimulus intensity was incrementally increased, 2-IMel increased duration only at lateral sites, suggesting that melatonin action is stronger in the lateral midbrain. For animals receiving 5 days of constant darkness, known to increase VN excitability, systemic injections of either of two mammalian melatonin receptor antagonists increased threshold and decreased duration for calls evoked from medial sites. Our results demonstrate melatonin modulation of VN excitability and suggest that social context-dependent call types differing in duration may be determined by neuro-hormonal action within specific regions of a midbrain vocal-acoustic network."},{"title":"Daphnia's dilemma: adjustment of carbon budgets in the face of food and cholesterol limitation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1079","abstract":"We studied the carbon (C) metabolism in Daphnia when the amount of C (food quantity) and/or the content of biochemical nutrients (food quality) was limiting. Growth performances and C budgets of Daphnia magna (assimilation, faeces egestion, excretion and respiration measured by [14C]-tracing) were analysed when animals were raised on different food quantities and concentrations of cholesterol, an essential biochemical food compound. Cholesterol is of special interest because it not only acts as limiting nutrient but also contributes to the overall C pool of the animals. As the tissue cholesterol concentration in Daphnia is quite low, we hypothesized the selective exclusion of cholesterol from C budgeting and tested this using radiolabelled cholesterol. Somatic growth rates of D. magna were highest at high quantity and quality and were reduced to a moderate value if either the food quantity or the cholesterol concentration was low. Growth was lowest at low food quantity and quality. The measurements of C budgets revealed high regulative response to low food quality at high food quantity only. Here, low dietary cholesterol caused bulk C assimilation efficiency (AE) to decrease and assimilated (excess) C to be increasingly respired. Additionally, Daphnia enhanced efficient adjustment of C budgets when facing cholesterol limitation by (1) increasing the AE of the cholesterol itself and (2) not changing cholesterol respiration, which was still not detectable. In contrast, at low food quantity, Daphnia is unable to adjust for low food quality, emphasizing that food limitation could overrule food quality effects."},{"title":"Biomechanical determinants of bite force dimorphism in Cyclommatus metallifer stag beetles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1065","abstract":"In the stag beetle family (Lucanidae), males have diverged from females by sexual selection. The males fight each other for mating opportunities with their enlarged mandibles. It is known that owners of larger fighting apparatuses are favoured to win the male–male fights, but it was unclear whether male stag beetles also need to produce high bite forces while grabbing and lifting opponents in fights. We show that male Cyclommatus metallifer stag beetles bite three times as forcefully as females. This is not entirely unexpected given the spectacular nature of the fights, but all the more impressive given the difficulty of achieving this with their long mandibles (long levers). Our results suggest no increase in male intrinsic muscle strength to accomplish this. However, morphological analyses show that the long mandibular output levers in males are compensated by elongated input levers (and thus a wider anterior side of the head). The surplus of male bite force capability is realized by enlargement of the closer muscles of the mandibles, while overall muscle force direction remained optimal. To enable the forceful bites required to ensure male reproductive success, male head size and shape are adapted for long input levers and large muscles. Therefore, the entire head should be regarded as an integral part of male armature."},{"title":"Are torpid bats immune to anthropogenic noise?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1072","abstract":"Anthropogenic noise has a negative impact on a variety of animals. However, many bat species roost in places with high levels of anthropogenic noise. Here, we tested the hypothesis that torpid bats are insensitive to anthropogenic noise. In a laboratory experiment, we recorded skin temperature (Tsk) of bats roosting individually that were subjected to playbacks of different types of noise. We found that torpid bats with Tsk ~10°C lower than their active Tsk responded to all types of noise by elevating Tsk. Bats responded most strongly to colony and vegetation noise, and most weakly to traffic noise. The time of day when torpid bats were exposed to noise had a pronounced effect on responses. Torpid bats showed increasing responses from morning towards evening, i.e. towards the onset of the active phase. Skin temperature at the onset of noise exposure (Tsk,start, 17–29°C) was not related to the response. Moreover, we found evidence that torpid bats rapidly habituated to repeated and prolonged noise exposure."},{"title":"Ectoparasite performance when feeding on reproducing mammalian females: an unexpected decrease when on pregnant hosts","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1058","abstract":"Reproduction is an energy-demanding activity in mammalian females, with increased energy requirements during pregnancy and, especially, during lactation. To better understand the interactions between parasitism and host reproduction, we investigated feeding and reproductive performance of fleas (Xenopsylla ramesis) parasitizing non-reproducing, pregnant or lactating gerbilline rodents (Meriones crassus). Based on energetic considerations, we predicted that feeding and reproductive performance of fleas would be lowest on non-breeding females, moderate on pregnant females and highest on lactating females. We estimated feeding performance of the fleas via absolute and mass-specific bloodmeal size and reproductive performance via egg production and latency to peak oviposition. Host reproductive status had no effect on either absolute or mass-specific bloodmeal size or the day of peak oviposition, but significantly affected the daily number of eggs produced by a female flea. Surprisingly, and contrary to our predictions, egg production of fleas fed on pregnant rodents was significantly lower than that of fleas on non-reproducing and lactating rodents, while no difference in egg production between fleas feeding on non-reproducing and lactating hosts was found. Our results suggest that differences in parasite reproduction when feeding on hosts of different reproductive status are not associated with the different energy requirements of the hosts at non-breeding, pregnancy and lactation but rather with variation in hormonal and/or immune status during these periods."},{"title":"Antimicrobial properties of a nanostructured eggshell from a compost-nesting bird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/7/1116","abstract":"Infection is an important source of mortality for avian embryos but parental behaviors and eggs themselves can provide a network of antimicrobial defenses. Mound builders (Aves: Megapodiidae) are unique among birds in that they produce heat for developing embryos not by sitting on eggs but by burying them in carefully tended mounds of soil and microbially decomposing vegetation. The low infection rate of eggs of one species in particular, the Australian brush-turkey (Alectura lathami), suggests that they possess strong defensive mechanisms. To identify some of these mechanisms, we first quantified antimicrobial albumen proteins and characterized eggshell structure, finding that albumen was not unusually antimicrobial, but that eggshell cuticle was composed of nanometer-sized calcite spheres. Experimental tests revealed that these modified eggshells were significantly more hydrophobic and better at preventing bacterial attachment and penetration into the egg contents than chicken eggs. Our results suggest that these mechanisms may contribute to the antimicrobial defense system of these eggs, and may provide inspiration for new biomimetic anti-fouling surfaces."},{"title":"Phenotype manipulations confirm the role of pectoral muscles and haematocrit in avian maximal thermogenic capacity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/824","abstract":"In small resident bird species living at northern latitudes, winter cold acclimatization is associated with an increase in pectoral muscle size and haematocrit level, and this is thought to drive the seasonal increase in summit metabolic rate (Ṁsum, a measure of maximal shivering thermogenic capacity). However, evidence suggesting that pectoral muscle size influences Ṁsum is correlational and the link between haematrocrit level and Ṁsum remains to be demonstrated. We experimentally tested the relationship between pectoral muscle size and Ṁsum by manipulating muscle size using a feather clipping protocol in free-living wintering black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus). This also allowed us to investigate the link between haematocrit and thermogenic capacity. After a first series of measures on all birds, we cut half of the flight feathers of experimental individuals (N=14) and compared their fat and pectoral muscle scores, Ṁsum and haematocrit level at recapture with their previous measures and with those of control birds (N=17) that were captured and recaptured at comparable times. Results showed that: (1) experimental birds developed larger pectoral muscles than control individuals and (2) mass-independent Ṁsum was up to 16% higher in birds expressing large pectoral muscles. Ṁsum was also positively correlated with haematocrit, which was not affected by the experimental manipulation. These findings demonstrate that, for a given body mass, large pectoral muscles are associated with a higher Ṁsum in black-capped chickadees and that oxygen carrying capacity likely supports thermogenesis in this species."},{"title":"Expression of squid iridescence depends on environmental luminance and peripheral ganglion control","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/850","abstract":"Squid display impressive changes in body coloration that are afforded by two types of dynamic skin elements: structural iridophores (which produce iridescence) and pigmented chromatophores. Both color elements are neurally controlled, but nothing is known about the iridescence circuit, or the environmental cues, that elicit iridescence expression. To tackle this knowledge gap, we performed denervation, electrical stimulation and behavioral experiments using the long-fin squid, Doryteuthis pealeii. We show that while the pigmentary and iridescence circuits originate in the brain, they are wired differently in the periphery: (1) the iridescence signals are routed through a peripheral center called the stellate ganglion and (2) the iridescence motor neurons likely originate within this ganglion (as revealed by nerve fluorescence dye fills). Cutting the inputs to the stellate ganglion that descend from the brain shifts highly reflective iridophores into a transparent state. Taken together, these findings suggest that although brain commands are necessary for expression of iridescence, integration with peripheral information in the stellate ganglion could modulate the final output. We also demonstrate that squid change their iridescence brightness in response to environmental luminance; such changes are robust but slow (minutes to hours). The squid's ability to alter its iridescence levels may improve camouflage under different lighting intensities."},{"title":"Effects of hypoxia–cadmium interactions on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) mitochondrial bioenergetics: attenuation of hypoxia-induced proton leak by low doses of cadmium","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/831","abstract":"The goal of the present study was to elucidate the modulatory effects of cadmium (Cd) on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in light of the limited understanding of the mechanisms of multiple stressor interactions in aquatic organisms. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver mitochondria were isolated and energized with complex I substrates (malate–glutamate), and exposed to hypoxia (0>PO2<2 Torr) for 0–60 min followed by reoxygenation and measurement of coupled and uncoupled respiration and complex I enzyme activity. Thereafter, 5 min hypoxia was used to probe interactions with Cd (0–20 μmol l−1) and to test the hypothesis that deleterious effects of hypoxia/reoxygenation on mitochondria were mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hypoxia/reoxygenation inhibited state 3 and uncoupler-stimulated (state 3u) respiration while concomitantly stimulating states 4 and 4ol (proton leak) respiration, thus reducing phosphorylation and coupling efficiencies. Low doses of Cd (≤5 μmol l−1) reduced, while higher doses enhanced, hypoxia-stimulated proton leak. This was in contrast to the monotonic enhancement by Cd of hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced reductions of state 3 respiration, phosphorylation efficiency and coupling. Mitochondrial complex I activity was inhibited by hypoxia/reoxygenation, hence confirming the impairment of at least one component of the electron transport chain (ETC) in rainbow trout mitochondria. Similar to the effect on state 4 and proton leak, low doses of Cd partially reversed the hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced complex I activity inhibition. The ROS scavenger and sulfhydryl group donor N-acetylcysteine, administrated immediately prior to hypoxia exposure, reduced hypoxia/reoxygenation-stimulated proton leak without rescuing the inhibited state 3 respiration, suggesting that hypoxia/reoxygenation influences distinct aspects of mitochondria via different mechanisms. Our results indicate that hypoxia/reoxygenation impairs the ETC and sensitizes mitochondria to Cd via mechanisms that involve, at least in part, ROS. Moreover, we provide, for the first time in fish, evidence for a hormetic effect of Cd on mitochondrial bioenergetics – the attenuation of hypoxia/reoxygenation-stimulated proton leak and partial rescue of complex I inhibition by low Cd doses."},{"title":"Assessing the role of reproduction and stress in the spring emergence of haematozoan parasites in birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/841","abstract":"A spring emergence of avian haemosporidian infections is nearly universal among temperate zone birds and is often described as a cost of reproductive effort. We take advantage of the opportunistic (i.e. aseasonal) breeding schedule of the red crossbill (Loxia curvirostra) to determine the relative contributions of season versus host physiology to the timing and intensity of Haemoproteus infections in the temperate zone. Despite breeding activity in both the winter and summer, Haemoproteus infections were highly seasonal – occurring largely from May through September – and measures of host physiology (i.e. reproductive condition and stress parameters) did not explain parasite prevalence. However, within the spring–summer peak, infection intensity (i.e. parasite density) was positively correlated with plasma levels of testosterone and free corticosterone and negatively correlated with corticosterone binding globulin capacity. These data are discussed in terms of the behavioral ecology of host and vector, and suggest that both seasonal increases in vector activity and relapse of latent (i.e. dormant) infections contribute to the spring emergence in birds. Relapse of latent infections does not appear to be induced by reproductive activity or increased allostatic (i.e. energy) load, but rather by a season-specific change in host or parasite physiology (e.g. melatonin or endogenous rhythms)."},{"title":"Spontaneous locomotor activity in late-stage chicken embryos is modified by stretch of leg muscles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/896","abstract":"Chicks initiate bilateral alternating steps several days before hatching and adaptively walk within hours of hatching, but emergence of precocious walking skills is not well understood. One of our aims was to determine whether interactions between environment and movement experience prior to hatching are instrumental in establishing precocious motor skills. However, physiological evidence of proprioceptor development in the chick has yet to be established; thus, one goal of this study was to determine when in embryogenesis proprioception circuits can code changes in muscle length. A second goal was to determine whether proprioception circuits can modulate leg muscle activity during repetitive limb movements for stepping (RLMs). We hypothesized that proprioception circuits code changes in muscle length and/or tension, and modulate locomotor circuits producing RLMs in anticipation of adaptive locomotion at hatching. To this end, leg muscle activity and kinematics were recorded in embryos during normal posture and after fitting one ankle with a restraint that supported the limb in an atypical posture. We tested the hypotheses by comparing leg muscle activity during spontaneous RLMs in control posture and ankle extension restraint. The results indicated that proprioceptors detect changes in muscle length and/or muscle tension 3 days before hatching. Ankle extension restraint produced autogenic excitation of the ankle flexor and reciprocal inhibition of the ankle extensor. Restraint also modified knee extensor activity during RLMs 1 day before hatching. We consider the strengths and limitations of these results and propose that proprioception contributes to precocious locomotor development during the final 3 days before hatching."},{"title":"Visual feedback influences antennal positioning in flying hawk moths","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/908","abstract":"Insect antennae serve a variety of sensory functions including tactile sensing, olfaction and flight control. For all of these functions, the precise positioning of the antenna is essential to ensure the proper acquisition of sensory feedback. Although antennal movements in diverse insects may be elicited or influenced by multimodal sensory stimuli, the relative effects of these cues and their integration in the context of antennal positioning responses are not well understood. In previous studies, we have shown that fields of Böhm's bristles located at the base of the antennae provide crucial mechanosensory input for antennal positioning in flying hawk moths. Here, we present electrophysiological and behavioral evidence to show that, in addition to the Böhm's bristles, antennal muscles of hawk moths also respond to bilateral visual input. Moreover, in contrast to the mechanosensory-motor circuit, which is entirely contained within the ipsilateral side, visual feedback influences antennal positioning on both contralateral and ipsilateral sides. Electromyograms recorded from antennal muscles show that the latency of muscle responses to visual stimulation ranged from 35 to 60 ms, considerably slower than their responses to mechanosensory stimuli (<10 ms). Additionally, the visual inputs received by antennal muscles are both motion-sensitive and direction-selective. We characterized the influence of visual feedback on antennal positioning by presenting open-loop translational and rotational visual stimuli to tethered flying moths. During rotational stimuli, we observed that the antenna contralateral to the direction of the turn moved forward through larger angles than the ipsilateral antenna. These observations suggest that whereas input from the Böhm's bristles mediates rapid corrections of antennal position, visual feedback may be involved in slower, bilaterally coordinated movements of the antenna during visually guided flight maneuvers. Thus, visual feedback can modulate the set point at which the antenna is held during flight in hawk moths."},{"title":"Cryptochrome expression in the eye of migratory birds depends on their migratory status","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/918","abstract":"Most passerine birds are nocturnal migrants. When kept in captivity during the migratory periods, these species show a migratory restlessness, or Zugunruhe. Recent studies on Sylvia warblers have shown that Zugunruhe is an excellent proxy of migratory disposition. Passerine birds can use the Earth's geomagnetic field as a compass to keep their course during their migratory flight. Among the candidate magnetoreceptive mechanisms are the cryptochromes, flavoproteins located in the retina that are supposed to perceive the magnetic field through a light-mediated process. Previous work has suggested that expression of Cryptochrome 1 (Cry1) is increased in migratory birds compared with non-migratory species. Here we tested the hypothesis that Cry1 expression depends on migratory status. Blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla were caught before fall migration and held in registration cages. When the birds were showing robust Zugunruhe, we applied a food deprivation protocol that simulates a long migratory flight. When the birds were refed after 2 days, their Zugunruhe decreased substantially, as is expected from birds that would interrupt migration for a refuelling stopover. We found that Cry1 expression was higher at night than during daytime in birds showing Zugunruhe, whereas in birds that underwent the fasting-and-refeeding protocol and reduced their levels of Zugunruhe, night Cry1 expression decreased to daytime levels. Our work shows that Cry1 expression is dependent on the presence of Zugunruhe and not on species-specific or seasonal factors, or on the birds being active versus inactive. These results support the hypothesis that cryptochromes underlie magnetoreceptive mechanisms in birds."},{"title":"Divergent strategies for adaptations to stress resistance in two tropical Drosophila species: effects of developmental acclimation in D. bipectinata and the invasive species D. malerkotliana","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/924","abstract":"Previous studies on two tropical Drosophila species (D. malerkotliana and D. bipectinata) have shown lower resistance to stress-related traits but the rapid colonization of D. malerkotliana in the past few decades is not consistent with its sensitivity to desiccation and cold stress. We tested the hypothesis that developmental acclimation at two growth temperatures (17 and 25°C) can confer adaptations to desiccation and thermal stresses. We found divergence in developmental plastic effects on cuticular traits, i.e. a significant increase of body melanisation (~2-fold) and of cuticular lipid mass (~3-fold) in D. malerkotliana but only 1.5-fold higher cuticular lipid mass in D. bipectinata when grown at 17°C compared with 25°C. A comparison of the water budget of these two species showed significantly higher effects of developmental acclimation on body water content, rate of water loss and dehydration tolerance resulting in higher desiccation resistance in D. malerkotliana than in D. bipectinata. When grown in cooler conditions (17°C), D. malerkotliana had greater resistance to cold as well as desiccation stress. In contrast, heat resistance of D. bipectinata was higher when grown at 25°C. These laboratory observations are supported by data on seasonally varying populations. Furthermore, adult D. malerkotliana acclimated to different stresses showed greater resistance to those stresses than D. bipectinata adults. Thus, significant increase in stress resistance of D. malerkotliana through developmental acclimation may be responsible for its invasion and ecological success on different continents compared with D. bipectinata."},{"title":"Fast growers sprint slower: effects of food deprivation and re-feeding on sprint swimming performance in individual juvenile European sea bass","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/859","abstract":"While many ectothermic species can withstand prolonged fasting without mortality, food deprivation may have sublethal effects of ecological importance, including reductions in locomotor ability. Little is known about how such changes in performance in individual animals are related to either mass loss during food deprivation or growth rate during re-feeding. This study followed changes in the maximum sprint swimming performance of individual European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, throughout 45 days of food deprivation and 30 days of re-feeding. Maximum sprint speed did not show a significant decline until 45 days of food deprivation. Among individuals, the reduction in sprinting speed at this time was not related to mass loss. After 30 days of re-feeding, mean sprinting speed had recovered to match that of control fish. Among individuals, however, maximum sprinting speed was negatively correlated with growth rate after the resumption of feeding. This suggests that the rapid compensatory growth that occurs during re-feeding after a prolonged fast carries a physiological cost in terms of reduced sprinting capacity, the extent of which shows continuous variation among individuals in relation to growth rate. The long-term repeatability of maximum sprint speed was low when fish were fasted or fed a maintenance ration, but was high among control fish fed to satiation. Fish that had been previously food deprived continued to show low repeatability in sprinting ability even after the initiation of ad libitum feeding, probably stemming from variation in compensatory growth among individuals and its associated negative effects on sprinting ability. Together, these results suggest that food limitation can disrupt hierarchies of maximum sprint performance within populations. In the wild, the cumulative effects on locomotor capacity of fasting and re-feeding could lead to variable survival among individuals with different growth trajectories following a period of food deprivation."},{"title":"Windscape and tortuosity shape the flight costs of northern gannets","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/876","abstract":"When animals move across a landscape, they alternate between active searching phases in areas with high prey density and commuting phases towards and in-between profitable feeding patches. Such active searching movements are more sinuous than travelling movements, and supposedly more costly in energy. Here we provide an empirical validation of this long-lasting assumption. To this end, we evaluated simultaneously energy expenditure and trajectory in northern gannets (Morus bassanus) using GPS loggers, dive recorders and three-dimensional accelerometers. Three behavioural states were determined from GPS data: foraging, when birds actively searched for prey (high tortuosity, medium speed); travelling, when birds were commuting (straight trajectory, high speed); and resting (straight trajectory, low speed). Overall dynamic body acceleration, calculated from acceleration data, was used as a proxy for energy expenditure during flight. The impact of windscape characteristics (wind force and direction) upon flight costs was also tested. Energy expenditure of northern gannets was higher during sinuous foraging flight than during more rectilinear travelling flight, demonstrating that turns are indeed costly. Yet wind force and direction also strongly shaped flight energy expenditure; within any behavioural state it was less costly to fly with the wind than against it, and less costly to fly with strong winds. Despite the major flight costs of wind action, birds did not fully optimize their flight track relative to wind direction, probably because of prey distributions relative to the coastline and wind predictability. Our study illustrates how both tortuosity and windscape shape the foraging costs of marine predators such as northern gannets."},{"title":"Relative roles of temperature and photoperiod as drivers of metabolic flexibility in dark-eyed juncos","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/866","abstract":"Seasonal phenotypic flexibility in small birds produces a winter phenotype with elevated maximum cold-induced metabolic rates (=summit metabolism, Ṁsum). Temperature and photoperiod are candidates for drivers of seasonal phenotypes, but their relative impacts on metabolic variation are unknown. We examined photoperiod and temperature effects on Ṁsum, muscle masses and activities of key catabolic enzymes in winter dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis). We randomly assigned birds to four treatment groups varying in temperature (cold=3°C; warm=24°C) and photoperiod [short day (SD)=8 h:16 h light:dark; long day (LD)=16 h:8 h light:dark] in a two-by-two design. We measured body mass (Mb), flight muscle width and Ṁsum before and after 3 and 6 weeks of acclimation, and flight muscle and heart masses after 6 weeks. Ṁsum increased for cold-exposed, but not for warm-exposed, birds. LD birds gained more Mb than SD birds, irrespective of temperature. Flight muscle size and mass did not differ significantly among groups, but heart mass was larger in cold-exposed birds. Citrate synthase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase and β-hydroxyacyl Co-A dehydrogenase activities in the pectoralis were generally higher for LD and cold groups. The cold-induced changes in Ṁsum and heart mass parallel winter changes for small birds, but the larger Mb and higher catabolic enzyme activities in LD birds suggest photoperiod-induced changes associated with migratory disposition. Temperature appears to be a primary driver of flexibility in Ṁsum in juncos, but photoperiod-induced changes in Mb and catabolic enzyme activities, likely associated with migratory disposition, interact with temperature to contribute to seasonal phenotypes."},{"title":"The sensitivity of lateral line receptors and their role in the behavior of Mexican blind cavefish (Astyanax mexicanus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/886","abstract":"The characid fish species Astyanax mexicanus offers a classic comparative model for the evolution of sensory systems. Populations of this species evolved in caves and became blind while others remained in streams (i.e. surface fish) and retained a functional visual system. The flow-sensitive lateral line receptors, called superficial neuromasts, are more numerous in cavefish than in surface fish, but it is unclear whether individual neuromasts differ in sensitivity between these populations. The aims of this study were to determine whether the neuromasts in cavefish impart enhanced sensitivity relative to surface fish and to test whether this aids their ability to sense flow in the absence of visual input. Sensitivity was assessed by modeling the mechanics and hydrodynamics of a flow stimulus. This model required that we measure the dimensions of the transparent cupula of a neuromast, which was visualized with fluorescent microspheres. We found that neuromasts within the eye orbit and in the suborbital region were larger and consequently about twice as sensitive in small adult cavefish as in surface fish. Behavioral experiments found that these cavefish, but not surface fish, were attracted to a 35 Hz flow stimulus. These results support the hypothesis that the large superficial neuromasts of small cavefish aid in flow sensing. We conclude that the morphology of the lateral line could have evolved in cavefish to permit foraging in a cave environment."},{"title":"Modulation of appetite and feeding behavior of the larval mosquito Aedes aegypti by the serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor paroxetine: shifts between distinct feeding modes and the influence of feeding status","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/935","abstract":"The effects of the serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor paroxetine (2×10−5 mol l−1) on behavior of the larval mosquito Aedes aegypti are described. Four discrete behavioral states dominate larval behavior: wriggling, two distinct types of feeding, and quiescence. Feeding behaviors consist of foraging along the bottom of the container (substrate browsing), and stationary filter feeding while suspended from the surface film. Fed larvae respond to paroxetine with increased wriggling, and reductions in both feeding behaviors. In contrast, food-deprived larvae treated with paroxetine show no change in the proportion of time spent wriggling or feeding, but shift from stationary filter feeding to substrate browsing. Thus, actions of paroxetine in fed larvae are consistent with suppression of appetite and stimulation of wriggling, whereas paroxetine causes food-deprived larvae to switch from one feeding behavior to another. Further analysis of unfed larvae revealed that paroxetine decreased the power stroke frequency during wriggling locomotion, but had no effect on the swimming velocity during either wriggling or substrate browsing. These data suggest that: (1) serotonergic pathways may trigger shifts between distinct behaviors by actions on higher level (brain) integrating centers where behaviors such as feeding and locomotion are coordinated; (2) these centers in fed and food-deprived larvae respond differently to serotonergic stimulation suggesting sensory feedback from feeding status; and (3) serotonergic pathways also modulate central pattern generators of the nerve cord where the bursts of action potentials originate that drive the rhythmic muscle contractions of wriggling."},{"title":"Glottal opening and closing events investigated by electroglottography and super-high-speed video recordings","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/955","abstract":"Previous research has suggested that the peaks in the first derivative (dEGG) of the electroglottographic (EGG) signal are good approximate indicators of the events of glottal opening and closing.

The present study attempts to corroborate these previous findings, utilizing super-HSV recordings. The HSV and EGG recordings (sampled at 27 and 44 kHz, respectively) of an excised canine larynx phonation were synchronized by an external TTL signal to within 0.037 ms. Data were analyzed by means of glottovibrograms, digital kymograms, the glottal area waveform and the vocal fold contact length (VFCL), a new parameter representing the time-varying degree of ‘zippering’ closure along the anterior–posterior (A–P) glottal axis. The temporal offsets between glottal events (depicted in the HSV recordings) and dEGG peaks in the opening and closing phase of glottal vibration ranged from 0.02 to 0.61 ms, amounting to 0.24–10.88% of the respective glottal cycle durations. All dEGG double peaks coincided with vibratory A–P phase differences. In two out of the three analyzed video sequences, peaks in the first derivative of the VFCL coincided with dEGG peaks, again co-occurring with A–P phase differences. The findings suggest that dEGG peaks do not always coincide with the events of glottal closure and initial opening. Vocal fold contacting and de-contacting do not occur at infinitesimally small instants of time, but extend over a certain interval, particularly under the influence of A–P phase differences."},{"title":"Testing the constant-volume hypothesis by magnetic resonance imaging of Mytilus galloprovincialis heart","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/964","abstract":"The constant-volume (CV) hypothesis was tested using the Mytilus galloprovincialis heart under two conditions. The volume of the ventricle, auricles and pericardium, and the flow in the heart and adjacent vessels were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. In synthetic seawater at 23°C (immersed condition), the end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV) and stroke volume (SV) were 50%, 21% and 29% of the heart volume, respectively, and the auricle volume (VA) was maximized at end-systole. Assuming a constant volume of the heart, venous return to the auricles (IV) was constant, and out-flow from the pericardium to the kidney (IPK) was 2/3 of SV. During aerial exposure (emersed condition), EDV, ESV and SV decreased to 33%, 22% and 11%, respectively. VA was maximized at end-diastole and associated with the decrease of systolic IV to 1/2 of diastolic IV, while IPK remained at 80% of the immersed condition. Based on these results – in addition to two postulates of the CV hypothesis: (1) the total volume of the heart is always the same, and (2) ventricle contraction causes a decrease in pressure in the pericardium – we modified two postulates: (3) the low pericardial pressure maintains venous return from the anterior oblique vein to the auricle, and (4) the pressure difference between the auricle and the pericardium drives haemolymph filtration through the auricle walls. We also added a new postulate: (5) dilatation of the ventricle is associated with the haemolymph output to the kidney via the renopericardial canals."},{"title":"Detection and selective avoidance of near ultraviolet radiation by an aquatic annelid: the medicinal leech","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/974","abstract":"Medicinal leeches are aquatic predators that inhabit surface waters during daylight and also leave the water where they might be exposed to less screened light. Whereas the leech visual system has been shown to respond to visible light, leeches in the genus Hirudo do not appear to be as negatively phototactic as one might expect in order to avoid potential ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced damage. I used high intensity light emitting diodes to test the hypothesis that leeches could detect and specifically avoid near UVR (395–405 nm). Groups of unfed juvenile leeches exhibited a robust negative phototaxis to UVR, but had no behavioral response to blue or red and only a slight negative phototaxis to green and white light. Individual leeches also exhibited a vigorous negative phototaxis to UVR; responding in 100% of trials compared with modest negative responses to visible light (responding in ~8% of the trials). The responses in fed and unfed leeches were comparable for UVR stimuli. The responses depended upon the stimulus site: leeches shortened away from UV light to the head, and extended away from UV light to the tail. Electrophysiological nerve recordings showed that the cephalic eyes responded vigorously to UVR. Additionally, individual leech photoreceptors also showed strong responses to UVR, and a higher-order neuron associated with shortening and rapid behavioral responses, the S-cell, was activated by UVR, on both the head and tail. These results demonstrate that the leech can detect UVR and is able to discriminate behaviorally between UVR and visible light."},{"title":"Landmarks and ant search strategies after interrupted tandem runs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/944","abstract":"During a tandem run, a single leading ant recruits a single follower to an important resource such as a new nest. To examine this process, we used a motorized gantry, which has not previously been used in ant studies, to track tandem running ants accurately in a large arena and we compared their performance in the presence of different types of landmark. We interrupted tandem runs by taking away the leader and moved a large distant landmark behind the new nest just at the time of this separation. Our aim was to determine what information followers might have obtained from the incomplete tandem run they had followed, and how they behaved after the tandem run had been interrupted. Our results show that former followers search by using composite random strategies with elements of sub-diffusive and diffusive movements. Furthermore, when we provided more landmarks former followers searched for longer. However, when all landmarks were removed completely from the arena, the ants' search duration lasted up to four times longer. Hence, their search strategy changes in the presence or absence of landmarks. Even after extensive search of this kind, former followers headed back to their old nest but did not return along the path of the tandem run they had followed. The combination of the position to which the large distant landmark behind the new nest was moved and the presence or absence of additional landmarks influenced the orientation of the former followers' paths back to the old nest. We also found that these ants exhibit behavioural lateralization in which they possibly use their right eye more than their left eye to recognize landmarks for navigation. Our results suggest that former follower ants learn landmarks during tandem running and use this information to make strategic decisions."},{"title":"Autonomous changes in the swimming direction of sperm in the gastropod Strombus luhuanus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/986","abstract":"The sperm of the gastropod Strombus luhuanus show dimorphism. The eusperm have a nucleus and fertilize the egg, whereas the other type of sperm, parasperm, are anucleate and are thought to assist fertilization. Here we report the autonomous changes in the swimming pattern of S. luhuanus eusperm. In artificial seawater, the eusperm collected from S. luhuanus sperm ducts formed sperm bundles and initially swam backward with asymmetric flagellar waveforms to detach from the bundles. One hour later, the sperm began to swim forward and in a circle. After an additional 1 h incubation, the sperm swam straight, with a change in the flagellar waveforms from asymmetric to symmetric. Spontaneous backward swimming with symmetric waveforms was also observed. The eusperm stored in the female seminal receptacle were motile and showed forward symmetric swimming with spontaneous backward swimming, which appeared necessary for detachment from the wall of receptacle. All of these motility changes were observed in the absence of parasperm, suggesting that these changes autonomously occur in eusperm. Our waveform analysis of these swimming patterns revealed that only the swimming with symmetric waveform showed reverse propagation of the flagellar waveforms. Both types of backward swimming were diminished in Ca2+-free seawater and in seawater containing Ni2+, indicating the regulation of swimming direction by Ca2+-dependent signal transduction."},{"title":"Interplay between group size, huddling behavior and basal metabolism: an experimental approach in the social degu","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/997","abstract":"Mammals exposed to low temperatures increase their metabolic rate to maintain constant body temperature and thus compensate for heat loss. This high and costly energetic demand can be mitigated through thermoregulatory behavior such as social grouping or huddling, which helps to decrease metabolic rate as function of the numbers of individuals grouped. Sustained low temperatures in endothermic animals produce changes over time in rates of energy expenditure, by means of phenotypic plasticity. However, the putative modulating effect that huddling exerts on the flexibility of the basal metabolic rate (BMR) due to thermal acclimation remains unknown. We determined BMR values in Octodon degus, an endemic Chilean rodent, after being acclimated to either 15 or 30°C during 60 days, both alone and in groups of three and five individuals. At 15°C, BMR of huddling individuals was 40% lower than that of animals housed alone. Moreover, infrared thermography revealed a significant increase in local surface temperatures in huddled animals. Furthermore, individual thermal conductance was lower in individuals acclimated to 15°C than to 30°C, but no differences were observed between single and grouped animals. Our results indicate that huddling prevents an increase in BMR when animals are acclimated to cold conditions and that this effect is proportional to the number of animals grouped."},{"title":"Aerobic scope fails to explain the detrimental effects on growth resulting from warming and elevated CO2 in Atlantic halibut","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/5/711","abstract":"As a consequence of increasing atmospheric CO2, the world's oceans are becoming warmer and more acidic. Whilst the ecological effects of these changes are poorly understood, it has been suggested that fish performance including growth will be reduced mainly as a result of limitations in oxygen transport capacity. Contrary to the predictions given by the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis, we show that aerobic scope and cardiac performance of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) increase following 14–16 weeks exposure to elevated temperatures and even more so in combination with CO2-acidified seawater. However, the increase does not translate into improved growth, demonstrating that oxygen uptake is not the limiting factor for growth performance at high temperatures. Instead, long-term exposure to CO2-acidified seawater reduces growth at temperatures that are frequently encountered by this species in nature, indicating that elevated atmospheric CO2 levels may have serious implications on fish populations in the future."},{"title":"Rhodopsin coexpression in UV photoreceptors of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/6/1003","abstract":"Differential rhodopsin gene expression within specialized R7 photoreceptor cells divides the retinas of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes into distinct domains. The two species express the rhodopsin orthologs Aaop8 and Agop8, respectively, in a large subset of these R7 photoreceptors that function as ultraviolet receptors. We show here that a divergent subfamily of mosquito rhodopsins, Aaop10 and Agop10, is coexpressed in these R7 photoreceptors. The properties of the A. aegypti Aaop8 and Aaop10 rhodopsins were analyzed by creating transgenic Drosophila expressing these rhodopsins. Electroretinogram recordings, and spectral analysis of head extracts, obtained from the Aaop8 strain confirmed that Aaop8 is an ultraviolet-sensitive rhodopsin. Aaop10 was poorly expressed and capable of eliciting only small and slow light responses in Drosophila photoreceptors, and electroretinogram analysis suggested that it is a long-wavelength rhodopsin with a maximal sensitivity near 500 nm. Thus, coexpression of Aaop10 rhodopsin with Aaop8 rhodopsin has the potential to modify the spectral properties of mosquito ultraviolet receptors. Retention of Op10 rhodopsin family members in the genomes of Drosophila species suggests that this rhodopsin family may play a conserved role in insect vision."},{"title":"Amphibious hearing in spotted seals (Phoca largha): underwater audiograms, aerial audiograms and critical ratio measurements","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/5/726","abstract":"Spotted seals (Phoca largha) inhabit Arctic regions that are facing both rapid climate change and increasing industrialization. While little is known about their sensory capabilities, available knowledge suggests that spotted seals and other ice seals use sound to obtain information from the surrounding environment. To quantitatively assess their auditory capabilities, the hearing of two young spotted seals was tested using a psychophysical paradigm. Absolute detection thresholds for tonal sounds were measured in air and under water over the frequency range of hearing, and critical ratios were determined using octave-band masking noise in both media. The behavioral audiograms show a range of best sensitivity spanning four octaves in air, from approximately 0.6 to 11 kHz. The range of sensitive hearing extends across seven octaves in water, with lowest thresholds between 0.3 and 56 kHz. Critical ratio measurements were similar in air and water and increased monotonically from 12 dB at 0.1 kHz to 30 dB at 25.6 kHz, indicating that the auditory systems of these seals are quite efficient at extracting signals from background noise. This study demonstrates that spotted seals possess sound reception capabilities different from those previously described for ice seals, and more similar to those reported for harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). The results are consistent with the amphibious lifestyle of these seals and their apparent reliance on sound. The hearing data reported herein are the first available for spotted seals and can inform best management practices for this vulnerable species in a changing Arctic."},{"title":"Thyroid hormone regulates cardiac performance during cold acclimation in zebrafish (Danio rerio)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/5/718","abstract":"Limitations to oxygen transport reduce aerobic scope and thereby activity at thermal extremes. Oxygen transport in fish is facilitated to a large extent by cardiac function so that climate variability may reduce fitness by constraining the performance of the heart. In zebrafish (Danio rerio), thyroid hormone (TH) regulates skeletal muscle function and metabolism in response to thermal acclimation. Here, we aimed to determine whether TH also regulates cardiac function during acclimation. We used propylthiouracil and iopanoic acid to induce hypothyroidism in zebrafish over a 3 week acclimation period to either 18 or 28°C. We found that cold-acclimated fish had higher maximum heart rates and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) activity than warm-acclimated fish. Hypothyroid treatment significantly decreased these responses in the cold-acclimated fish, but it did not affect the warm-acclimated fish. TH did not influence SERCA gene transcription, nor did it increase metabolic rate, of isolated whole hearts. To verify that physiological changes following hypothyroid treatment were in fact due to the action of TH, we supplemented hypothyroid fish with 3,5-diiodothryronine (T2) or 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3). Supplementation of hypothyroid fish with T2 or T3 restored heart rate and SERCA activity to control levels. We also show that, in zebrafish, changes in cardiac output in response to warming are primarily mediated by heart rate, rather than by stroke volume. Thus, changes in heart rate are important for the overall aerobic capacity of the fish. In addition to its local effects on heart phenotype, we show that TH increases sympathetic tone on the heart at rest and during maximum exercise. Our findings reveal a new pathway through which fish can mitigate the limiting effects of temperature variability on oxygen transport to maintain aerobic scope and promote thermal tolerance."},{"title":"A comparative study of single-leg ground reaction forces in running lizards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/5/735","abstract":"The role of different limbs in supporting and propelling the body has been studied in many species with animals appearing to have either similarity in limb function or differential limb function. Differential hindlimb versus forelimb function has been proposed as a general feature of running with a sprawling posture and as benefiting sprawled postured animals by enhancing maneuvering and minimizing joint moments. Yet only a few species have been studied and thus the generality of differential limb function in running animals with sprawled postures is unknown. We measured the limb lengths of seven species of lizard and their single-limb three-dimensional ground reaction forces during high-speed running. We found that all species relied on the hindlimb for producing accelerative forces. Braking forces were forelimb dominated in four species and equally distributed between limbs in the other three. Vertical forces were dominated by the hindlimb in three species and equally distributed between the forelimb and hindlimb in the other four. Medial forces were dominated by the hindlimb in four species and equally distributed in the other three, with all Iguanians exhibiting hindlimb-biased medial forces. Relative hindlimb to forelimb length of each species was related to variation in hindlimb versus forelimb medial forces; species with relatively longer hindlimbs compared with forelimbs exhibited medial forces that were more biased towards the hindlimbs. These results suggest that the function of individual limbs in lizards varies across species with only a single general pattern (hindlimb-dominated accelerative force) being present."},{"title":"Larval vision contributes to gregarious settlement in barnacles: adult red fluorescence as a possible visual signal","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/5/743","abstract":"Gregarious settlement, an essential behavior for many barnacle species that can only reproduce by mating with a nearby barnacle, has long been thought to rely on larval ability to recognize chemical signals from conspecifics during settlement. However, the cyprid, the settlement stage larva in barnacles, has one pair of compound eyes that appear only at the late nauplius VI and cyprid stages, but the function(s) of these eyes remains unknown. Here we show that cyprids of the intertidal barnacle Balanus (=Amphibalanus) amphitrite can locate adult barnacles even in the absence of chemical cues, and prefer to settle around them probably via larval sense of vision. We also show that the cyprids can discriminate color and preferred to settle on red surfaces. Moreover, we found that shells of adult B. amphitrite emit red auto-fluorescence and the adult extracts with the fluorescence as a visual signal attracted cyprid larvae to settle around it. We propose that the perception of specific visual signals can be involved in behavior of zooplankton including marine invertebrate larvae, and that barnacle auto-fluorescence may be a specific signal involved in gregarious larval settlement."},{"title":"Factors affecting metabolic cost of transport during a multi-stage running race","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/5/787","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate: (1) the role of <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/217/5/787/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>, the fraction of <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/217/5/787/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/> (F) and the metabolic cost of transport (CoT) in determining performance during an ultra-endurance competition and (2) the effects of the race on several biomechanical and morphological parameters of the lower limbs that are likely to affect CoT. Eleven runners (aged 29–54 years) participated in an ultra-endurance competition consisting of three running stages of 25, 55 and 13 km on three consecutive days. Anthropometric characteristics, body composition, morphological properties of the gastrocnemius medialis, maximal explosive power of the lower limb and <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/217/5/787/embed/inline-graphic-3.gif\"/> were determined before the competition.

About 50% of the increase in CoT during the stages of the competition was accounted for by changes in FPI, which represents a global evaluation of medio-lateral displacement of the foot during the whole stance phase, which in turn is associated with the myotendinous characteristics of the lower limb. Thus, lower CoT values were related to greater muscular power and lower FPI, suggesting that a better ankle stability is likely to achieve better performance in an ultra-endurance running competition."},{"title":"Function and control of the fish secondary vascular system, a contrast to mammalian lymphatic systems","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/5/751","abstract":"Teleost fishes and mammalian lineages diverged 400 million years ago, and environmental requirements (water versus air) have resulted in marked differences in cardiovascular function between fish and mammals. Suggestions that the fish secondary vascular system (SVS) could be used as a model for the mammalian lymphatic system should be taken with caution. Despite molecular markers indicating similar genetic origin, functions of the SVS in teleost fish are probably different from those of the mammalian lymphatic system. We determined that, in resting glass catfish (Kryptopterus bicirrhis), plasma moves from the primary vascular system (PVS) to the SVS through small connecting vessels less than 10 μm in diameter, smaller than the red blood cells (RBCs). During and following hypoxia or exercise, flow increases and RBCs enter the SVS, possibly via β-adrenoreceptor-mediated dilation of the connecting vessels. The volume of the SVS can be large and, as RBCs flow into the SVS, the haematocrit of the PVS falls by as much as 50% of the resting value. Possible functions of the SVS, including skin respiration, ionic and osmotic buffering, and reductions in heart work and RBC turnover, are discussed."},{"title":"An experimental and morphometric test of the relationship between vertebral morphology and joint stiffness in Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/5/758","abstract":"Despite their semi-aquatic mode of life, modern crocodylians use a wide range of terrestrial locomotor behaviours, including asymmetrical gaits otherwise only found in mammals. The key to these diverse abilities may lie in the axial skeleton. Correlations between vertebral morphology and both intervertebral joint stiffness and locomotor behaviour have been found in other animals, but the vertebral mechanics of crocodylians have not yet been experimentally and quantitatively tested. We measured the passive mechanics and morphology of the thoracolumbar vertebral column in Crocodylus niloticus in order to validate a method to infer intervertebral joint stiffness based on morphology. Passive stiffness of eight thoracic and lumbar joints was tested in dorsal extension, ventral flexion and mediolateral flexion using cadaveric specimens. Fifteen measurements that we deemed to be potential correlates of stiffness were taken from each vertebra and statistically tested for correlation with joint stiffness. We found that the vertebral column of C. niloticus is stiffer in dorsoventral flexion than in lateral flexion and, in contrast to that of many mammals, shows an increase in joint stiffness in the lumbar region. Our findings suggest that the role of the axial column in crocodylian locomotion may be functionally different from that in mammals, even during analogous gaits. A moderate proportion of variation in joint stiffness (R2=0.279–0.520) was predicted by centrum width and height, neural spine angle and lamina width. These results support the possible utility of some vertebral morphometrics in predicting mechanical properties of the vertebral column in crocodiles, which also should be useful for forming functional hypotheses of axial motion during locomotion in extinct archosaurs."},{"title":"Molt regulation in green and red color morphs of the crab Carcinus maenas: gene expression of molt-inhibiting hormone signaling components","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/5/796","abstract":"In decapod crustaceans, regulation of molting is controlled by the X-organ/sinus gland complex in the eyestalks. The complex secretes molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH), which suppresses production of ecdysteroids by the Y-organ (YO). MIH signaling involves nitric oxide and cGMP in the YO, which expresses nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (GC-I). Molting can generally be induced by eyestalk ablation (ESA), which removes the primary source of MIH, or by multiple leg autotomy (MLA). In our work on Carcinus maenas, however, ESA has limited effects on hemolymph ecdysteroid titers and animals remain in intermolt at 7 days post-ESA, suggesting that adults are refractory to molt induction techniques. Consequently, the effects of ESA and MLA on molting and YO gene expression in C. maenas green and red color morphotypes were determined at intermediate (16 and 24 days) and long-term (~90 days) intervals. In intermediate-interval experiments, ESA of intermolt animals caused transient twofold to fourfold increases in hemolymph ecdysteroid titers during the first 2 weeks. In intermolt animals, long-term ESA increased hemolymph ecdysteroid titers fourfold to fivefold by 28 days post treatment, but there was no late premolt peak (>400 pg μl−1) characteristic of late premolt animals and animals did not molt by 90 days post-ESA. There was no effect of ESA or MLA on the expression of Cm-elongation factor 2 (EF2), Cm-NOS, the beta subunit of GC-I (Cm-GC-Iβ), a membrane receptor GC (Cm-GC-II) and a soluble NO-insensitive GC (Cm-GC-III) in green morphs. Red morphs were affected by prolonged ESA and MLA treatments, as indicated by large decreases in Cm-EF2, Cm-GC-II and Cm-GC-III mRNA levels. ESA accelerated the transition of green morphs to the red phenotype in intermolt animals. ESA delayed molting in premolt green morphs, whereas intact and MLA animals molted by 30 days post treatment. There were significant effects on YO gene expression in intact animals: Cm-GC-Iβ mRNA increased during premolt and Cm-GC-III mRNA decreased during premolt and increased during postmolt. Cm-MIH transcripts were detected in eyestalk ganglia, the brain and the thoracic ganglion from green intermolt animals, suggesing that MIH in the brain and thoracic ganglion prevents molt induction in green ESA animals."},{"title":"Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) have greater blood volumes, higher diving metabolic rates and a longer aerobic dive limit when nutritionally stressed","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/5/769","abstract":"Marine mammal foraging behaviour inherently depends on diving ability. Declining populations of Steller sea lions may be facing nutritional stress that could affect their diving ability through changes in body composition or metabolism. Our objective was to determine whether nutritional stress (restricted food intake resulting in a 10% decrease in body mass) altered the calculated aerobic dive limit (cADL) of four captive sea lions diving in the open ocean, and how this related to changes in observed dive behaviour. We measured diving metabolic rate (DMR), blood O2 stores, body composition and dive behaviour prior to and while under nutritional restriction. We found that nutritionally stressed sea lions increased the duration of their single long dives, and the proportion of time they spent at the surface during a cycle of four dives. Nutritionally stressed sea lions lost both lipid and lean mass, resulting in potentially lower muscle O2 stores. However, total body O2 stores increased due to rises in blood O2 stores associated with having higher blood volumes. Nutritionally stressed sea lions also had higher mass-specific metabolic rates. The greater rise in O2 stores relative to the increase in mass-specific DMR resulted in the sea lions having a longer cADL when nutritionally stressed. We conclude that there was no negative effect of nutritional stress on the diving ability of sea lions. However, nutritional stress did lower foraging efficiency and require more foraging time to meet energy requirements due to increases in diving metabolic rates and surface recovery times."},{"title":"Form and metabolic scaling in colonial animals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/5/779","abstract":"Benthic colonial organisms exhibit a wide variation in size and shape and provide excellent model systems for testing the predictions of models that describe the scaling of metabolic rate with organism size. We tested the hypothesis that colony form will influence metabolic scaling and its derivatives by characterising metabolic and propagule production rates in three species of freshwater bryozoans that vary in morphology and module organisation and which demonstrate two- and three-dimensional growth forms. The results were evaluated with respect to predictions from two models for metabolic scaling. Isometric metabolic scaling in two-dimensional colonies supported predictions of a model based on dynamic energy budget theory (DEB) and not those of a model based on fractally branching supply networks. This metabolic isometry appears to be achieved by equivalent energy budgets of edge and central modules, in one species (Cristatella mucedo) via linear growth and in a second species (Lophopus crystallinus) by colony fission. Allometric scaling characterised colonies of a three-dimensional species (Fredericella sultana), also providing support for the DEB model. Isometric scaling of propagule production rates for C. mucedo and F. sultana suggests that the number of propagules produced in colonies increases in direct proportion with the number of modules within colonies. Feeding currents generated by bryozoans function in both food capture and respiration, thus linking metabolic scaling with dynamics of self-shading and resource capture. Metabolic rates fundamentally dictate organismal performance (e.g. growth, reproduction) and, as we show here, are linked with colony form. Metabolic profiles and associated variation in colony form should therefore influence the outcome of biotic interactions in habitats dominated by colonial animals and may drive patterns of macroevolution."},{"title":"Oxygen delivery does not limit thermal tolerance in a tropical eurythermal crustacean","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/5/809","abstract":"In aquatic environments, rising water temperatures reduce water oxygen content while increasing oxygen demand, leading several authors to propose cardiorespiratory oxygen transport capacity as the main determinant of aquatic animal fitness.

Little, however, is known about physiological responses to high temperatures in tropical species. Here we report that the tropical giant freshwater shrimp (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) maintains normal growth when challenged by a temperature rise of 6°C above the present day average (from 27°C to 33°C). Further, by measuring heart rate, gill ventilation rate, resting and maximum oxygen uptake, and hemolymph lactate, we show that oxygen transport capacity is maintained up to the critical maximum temperature around 41°C. In M. rosenbergii heart rate and gill ventilation rate increases exponentially until immediately below critical temperatures and at 38°C animals still retained more than 76% of aerobic scope measured at 30°C, and there was no indication of anaerobic metabolism at the high temperatures. Our study shows that the oxygen transport capacity is maintained at high temperatures, and that other mechanisms, such as protein dysfunction, are responsible for the loss of ecological performance at elevated temperatures."},{"title":"Impact of elevated CO2 background levels on the host-seeking behaviour of Aedes aegypti","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/598","abstract":"Mosquitoes rely on carbon dioxide (CO2) to detect and orient towards their blood hosts. However, the variable and rapid fluctuations of atmospheric CO2 concentrations may have an impact on the host-seeking behaviour of mosquitoes. In this study, we analysed the effect of transient elevated background levels of CO2 on the host-seeking behaviour and the physiological characteristics of the CO2-sensitive olfactory receptor neurones (ORNs) in female yellow fever mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti. We show that the take-off and source contact behaviour of A. aegypti is impeded at elevated background levels of CO2 as a result of masking of the stimulus signal. The mechanism underlying this masking during take-off behaviour is one of sensory constraint. We show that the net response of the CO2-ORNs regulates this CO2-related behaviour. Since these neurones themselves are not habituated or fatigued by the transient elevation of background CO2, we propose that habituation of second-order neurones in response to the elevated CO2-ORN activity could be one mechanism by which the net response is transduced by the olfactory system. The findings from this study may help to predict future shifts in mosquito–host interactions and consequently to predict vectorial capacity in the light of climate change."},{"title":"Intraspecific variation in flight metabolic rate in the bumblebee Bombus impatiens: repeatability and functional determinants in workers and drones","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/536","abstract":"The evolution of flight energetics requires that phenotypes be variable, repeatable and heritable. We studied intraspecific variation in flight energetics in order to assess the repeatability of flight metabolic rate and wingbeat frequency, as well as the functional basis of phenotypic variation in workers and drones of the bumblebee species Bombus impatiens. We showed that flight metabolic rate and wingbeat frequency were highly repeatable in workers, even when controlling for body mass variation using residual analysis. We did not detect significant repeatability in drones, but a smaller range of variation might have prevented us from finding significant values in our sample. Based on our results and previous findings, we associated the high repeatability of flight phenotypes in workers to the functional links between body mass, thorax mass, wing size, wingbeat frequency and metabolic rate. Moreover, differences between workers and drones were as predicted from these functional associations, where drones had larger wings for their size, lower wingbeat frequency and lower flight metabolic rate. We also investigated thoracic muscle metabolic phenotypes by measuring the activity of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes, and we found positive correlations between mass-independent metabolic rate and the activity of all enzymes measured, but in workers only. When comparing workers and drones that differ in flight metabolic rate, only the activity of the enzymes hexokinase and trehalase showed the predicted differences. Overall, our study indicates that there should be correlated evolution among physiological phenotypes at multiple levels of organization and morphological traits associated with flight."},{"title":"Three floral volatiles contribute to differential pollinator attraction in monkeyflowers (Mimulus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/614","abstract":"Flowering plants employ a wide variety of signals, including scent, to attract the attention of pollinators. In this study we investigated the role of floral scent in mediating differential attraction between two species of monkeyflowers (Mimulus) reproductively isolated by pollinator preference. The emission rate and chemical identity of floral volatiles differ between the bumblebee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii and the hummingbird-pollinated M. cardinalis. Mimulus lewisii flowers produce an array of volatiles dominated by d-limonene, β-myrcene and E-β-ocimene. Of these three monoterpenes, M. cardinalis flowers produce only d-limonene, released at just 0.9% the rate of M. lewisii flowers. Using the Bombus vosnesenskii bumblebee, an important pollinator of M. lewisii, we conducted simultaneous gas chromatography with extracellular recordings in the bumblebee antennal lobe. Results from these experiments revealed that these three monoterpenes evoke significant neural responses, and that a synthetic mixture of the three volatiles evokes the same responses as the natural scent. Furthermore, the neural population shows enhanced responses to the M. lewisii scent over the scent of M. cardinalis. This neural response is reflected in behavior; in two-choice assays, bumblebees investigate artificial flowers scented with M. lewisii more frequently than ones scented with M. cardinalis, and in synthetic mixtures the three monoterpenes are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate responses to the natural scent of M. lewisii. In this system, floral scent alone is sufficient to elicit differential visitation by bumblebees, implying a strong role of scent in the maintenance of reproductive isolation between M. lewisii and M. cardinalis."},{"title":"Mechanics and energetics of load carriage during human walking","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/605","abstract":"Although humans clearly expend more energy to walk with an extra load, it is unclear what biomechanical mechanisms contribute to that increase. One possible contribution is the mechanical work performed on the body center of mass (COM), which simple models predict should increase linearly with added mass. The work should be performed primarily by the lower extremity joints, although in unknown distribution, and cost a proportionate amount of metabolic energy. We therefore tested normal adults (N=8) walking at constant speed (1.25 m s−1) with varying backpack loads up to 40% of body weight. We measured mechanical work (both performed on the COM and joint work from inverse dynamics), as well as metabolic energy expenditure through respirometry. Both measures of work were found to increase approximately linearly with carried load, with COM work rate increasing by approximately 1.40 W for each 1 kg of additional load. The joints all contributed work, but the greatest increase in positive work was attributable to the ankle during push-off (45–60% of stride time) and the knee in the rebound after collision (12–30% stride). The hip performed increasing amounts of negative work, near the end of stance. Rate of metabolic energy expenditure also increased approximately linearly with load, by approximately 7.6 W for each 1 kg of additional load. The ratio of the increases in work and metabolic cost yielded a relatively constant efficiency of approximately 16%. The metabolic cost not explained by work appeared to be relatively constant with load and did not exhibit a particular trend. Most of the increasing cost for carrying a load appears to be explained by positive mechanical work, especially about the ankle and knee, with both work and metabolic cost increasing nearly linearly with added mass."},{"title":"Mitochondrial uncoupling prevents cold-induced oxidative stress: a case study using UCP1 knockout mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/624","abstract":"The relationship between metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the mitochondria has often been (wrongly) viewed as straightforward, with increased metabolism leading to higher generation of pro-oxidants. Insights into mitochondrial functioning show that oxygen consumption is principally coupled with either energy conversion as ATP or as heat, depending on whether the ATP-synthase or the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is driving respiration. However, these two processes might greatly differ in terms of oxidative costs. We used a cold challenge to investigate the oxidative stress consequences of an increased metabolism achieved either by the activation of an uncoupled mechanism (i.e. UCP1 activity) in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) of wild-type mice or by ATP-dependent muscular shivering thermogenesis in mice deficient for UCP1. Although both mouse strains increased their metabolism by more than twofold when acclimatised for 4 weeks to moderate cold (12°C), only mice deficient for UCP1 suffered from elevated levels of oxidative stress. When exposed to cold, mice deficient for UCP1 showed an increase of 20.2% in plasmatic reactive oxygen metabolites, 81.8% in muscular oxidized glutathione and 47.1% in muscular protein carbonyls. In contrast, there was no evidence of elevated levels of oxidative stress in the plasma, muscles or BAT of wild-type mice exposed to cold despite a drastic increase in BAT activity. Our study demonstrates differing oxidative costs linked to the functioning of two highly metabolically active organs during thermogenesis, and advises careful consideration of mitochondrial functioning when investigating the links between metabolism and oxidative stress."},{"title":"Increased allocation of adult-acquired carbohydrate to egg production results in its decreased allocation to sex pheromone production in mated females of the moth Heliothis virescens","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/499","abstract":"Females of most species of moths produce a volatile sex pheromone that attracts conspecific males over distance. In females of the polyandrous moth Heliothis virescens, feeding on carbohydrate (e.g. nectar) supplies precursor, via hemolymph trehalose, for both sex pheromone and egg production. With limited carbohydrate acquisition these two reproductive physiologies might compete for hemolymph trehalose, resulting in an allocation deficit to either sex pheromone or egg production. Using virgin and mated females, which have low and high egg maturation rates, respectively, we fed females a limited diet of 13C-labeled glucose daily and, using mass isotopomer distribution analysis, determined allocations of adult-acquired carbohydrate (AAC) to newly synthesized pheromone and ovarian and egg fats, our proxies for allocation to egg production. With increased number of feeds, AAC enrichment of hemolymph trehalose increased, as expected. This led to mated females increasing their proportional allocation of AAC to ovarian and egg fats, but decreasing their proportional allocation of AAC to pheromone production. By contrast, virgins increased their proportional allocation of AAC to pheromone production with increased feeds, consistent with increasing AAC enrichment of hemolymph trehalose. These results show that with limited AAC intake, enhanced egg maturation in mated females results in reduced AAC allocation to pheromone production; this does not occur in virgins because of their lower egg maturation rate. This physiological competition for AAC corresponded with decreased pheromone production in mated moths to levels unlikely to attract mates. Therefore, the availability and/or allocation of AAC may be a proximate mechanism underlying the incidence of polyandry in this and other species of moths."},{"title":"Lateral light transfer ensures efficient resource distribution in symbiont-bearing corals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/489","abstract":"Coral tissue optics has received very little attention in the past, although the interaction between tissue and light is central to our basic understanding of coral physiology. Here we used fibre-optic and electrochemical microsensors along with variable chlorophyll fluorescence imaging to directly measure lateral light propagation within living coral tissues. Our results show that corals can transfer light laterally within their tissues to a distance of ~2 cm. Such light transport stimulates O2 evolution and photosystem II operating efficiency in areas >0.5–1 cm away from direct illumination. Light is scattered strongly in both coral tissue and skeleton, leading to photon trapping and lateral redistribution within the tissue. Lateral light transfer in coral tissue is a new mechanism by which light is redistributed over the coral colony and we argue that tissue optical properties are one of the key factors in explaining the high photosynthetic efficiency of corals."},{"title":"Differential impacts of ocean acidification and warming on winter and summer progeny of a coastal squid (Loligo vulgaris)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/518","abstract":"Little is known about the capacity of early life stages to undergo hypercapnic and thermal acclimation under the future scenarios of ocean acidification and warming. Here, we investigated a comprehensive set of biological responses to these climate change-related variables (2°C above winter and summer average spawning temperatures and ΔpH=0.5 units) during the early ontogeny of the squid Loligo vulgaris. Embryo survival rates ranged from 92% to 96% under present-day temperature (13–17°C) and pH (8.0) scenarios. Yet, ocean acidification (pH 7.5) and summer warming (19°C) led to a significant drop in the survival rates of summer embryos (47%, P<0.05). The embryonic period was shortened by increasing temperature in both pH treatments (P<0.05). Embryo growth rates increased significantly with temperature under present-day scenarios, but there was a significant trend reversal under future summer warming conditions (P<0.05). Besides pronounced premature hatching, a higher percentage of abnormalities was found in summer embryos exposed to future warming and lower pH (P<0.05). Under the hypercapnic scenario, oxygen consumption rates decreased significantly in late embryos and newly hatched paralarvae, especially in the summer period (P<0.05). Concomitantly, there was a significant enhancement of the heat shock response (HSP70/HSC70) with warming in both pH treatments and developmental stages. Upper thermal tolerance limits were positively influenced by acclimation temperature, and such thresholds were significantly higher in late embryos than in hatchlings under present-day conditions (P<0.05). In contrast, the upper thermal tolerance limits under hypercapnia were higher in hatchlings than in embryos. Thus, we show that the stressful abiotic conditions inside the embryo's capsules will be exacerbated under near-future ocean acidification and summer warming scenarios. The occurrence of prolonged embryogenesis along with lowered thermal tolerance limits under such conditions is expected to negatively affect the survival success of squid early life stages during the summer spawning period, but not winter spawning."},{"title":"Potential for sexual conflict assessed via testosterone-mediated transcriptional changes in liver and muscle of a songbird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/507","abstract":"Males and females can be highly dimorphic in metabolism and physiology despite sharing nearly identical genomes, and both sexes respond phenotypically to elevated testosterone, a steroid hormone that alters gene expression. Only recently has it become possible to learn how a hormone such as testosterone affects global gene expression in non-model systems, and whether it affects the same genes in males and females. To investigate the transcriptional mechanisms by which testosterone exerts its metabolic and physiological effects on the periphery, we compared gene expression by sex and in response to experimentally elevated testosterone in a well-studied bird species, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). We identified 291 genes in the liver and 658 in the pectoralis muscle that were differentially expressed between males and females. In addition, we identified 1727 genes that were differentially expressed between testosterone-treated and control individuals in at least one tissue and sex. Testosterone treatment altered the expression of only 128 genes in both males and females in the same tissue, and 847 genes were affected significantly differently by testosterone treatment in the two sexes. These substantial differences in transcriptional response to testosterone suggest that males and females may employ different pathways when responding to elevated testosterone, despite the fact that many phenotypic effects of experimentally elevated testosterone are similar in both sexes. In contrast, of the 121 genes that were affected by testosterone treatment in both sexes, 78% were regulated in the same direction (e.g. either higher or lower in testosterone-treated than control individuals) in both males and females. Thus, it appears that testosterone acts through both unique and shared transcriptional pathways in males and females, suggesting multiple mechanisms by which sexual conflict can be mediated."},{"title":"Correlated changes in life history traits in response to selection for faster pre-adult development in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/580","abstract":"Insects including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are under intense pressure to develop rapidly because they inhabit ephemeral habitats. We have previously shown that when selection for faster development was artificially imposed on D. melanogaster in the laboratory, reduction of pre-adult development time and shortening of the clock period occurs, suggesting a role for circadian clocks in the regulation of life history traits. Circadian clocks in D. melanogaster have also been implicated in the control of metabolic pathways, ageing processes, oxidative stress and defense responses to exogenous stressors. In order to rigorously examine correlations between pre-adult development time and other life history traits, we assayed pre-adult survivorship, starvation and desiccation resistance, body size and body weight, fecundity and adult lifespan in faster developing populations of D. melanogaster. The results revealed that selection for faster pre-adult development significantly reduced several adult fitness traits in the faster developing flies without affecting pre-adult survivorship. Although overall fecundity of faster developing flies was reduced, their egg output per unit body weight was significantly higher than that of controls, indicating that reduction in adult lifespan might be due to disproportionate investment in reproduction. Thus our results suggest that selection for faster pre-adult development in D. melanogaster yields flies with higher reproductive fitness. Because these flies also have shorter clock periods, our results can be taken to suggest that pre-adult development time and circadian clock period are correlated with various adult life history traits in D. melanogaster, implying that circadian clocks may have adaptive significance."},{"title":"Figure–ground discrimination behavior in Drosophila. II. Visual influences on head movement behavior","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/570","abstract":"Visual identification of small moving targets is a challenge for all moving animals. Their own motion generates displacement of the visual surroundings, inducing wide-field optic flow across the retina. Wide-field optic flow is used to sense perturbations in the flight course. Both ego-motion and corrective optomotor responses confound any attempt to track a salient target moving independently of the visual surroundings. What are the strategies that flying animals use to discriminate small-field figure motion from superimposed wide-field background motion? We examined how fruit flies adjust their gaze in response to a compound visual stimulus comprising a small moving figure against an independently moving wide-field ground, which they do by re-orienting their head or their flight trajectory. We found that fixing the head in place impairs object fixation in the presence of ground motion, and that head movements are necessary for stabilizing wing steering responses to wide-field ground motion when a figure is present. When a figure is moving relative to a moving ground, wing steering responses follow components of both the figure and ground trajectories, but head movements follow only the ground motion. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that wing responses can be uncoupled from head responses and that the two follow distinct trajectories in the case of simultaneous figure and ground motion. These results suggest that whereas figure tracking by wing kinematics is independent of head movements, head movements are important for stabilizing ground motion during active figure tracking."},{"title":"Mechanical output in jumps of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/482","abstract":"In this study we determined the mechanical output of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) during jumping. Vertical ground reaction forces were measured in 18 animals while they jumped from an instrumented crossbar to a crossbar located 70 cm higher. From the vertical force time histories, we calculated the rate of change of mechanical energy of the centre of mass (dE/dt). The mean value of dE/dt during the push-off amounted to 51.8±6.2 W kg−1 body mass, and the peak value to 116.4±17.6 W kg−1 body mass. We used these values in combination with masses of leg muscles, determined in two specimens, to estimate mean and peak values of dE/dt of 430 and 970 W kg−1 muscle, respectively. These values are higher than values reported in the literature for jumps of humans and bonobos, but smaller than those of jumps of bushbabies. Surprisingly, the mean value of dE/dt of 430 W kg−1 muscle was close to the maximal power output of 516 W kg−1 muscle reported in the literature for isokinetic contractions of rat medial gastrocnemius, one of the fastest mammalian muscles. Further study of the force–velocity relationship of muscle tissue of small primates is indicated."},{"title":"Interspecific variation in hypoxia tolerance, swimming performance and plasticity in cyprinids that prefer different habitats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/590","abstract":"This study quantified and compared hypoxia tolerance and swim performance among cyprinid fish species from rapid-, slow- and intermediate-flow habitats (four species per habitat) in China. In addition, we explored the effects of short-term acclimation on swim performance, maximum metabolic rate (ṀO2,max) and gill remodelling to detect habitat-associated patterns of plastic response to hypoxia. Indices of hypoxia tolerance included oxygen threshold for loss of equilibrium (LOE50) and aquatic surface respiration (ASR50), and critical oxygen tension for routine metabolic rate (Pcrit). Critical swimming speed (Ucrit) and ṀO2,max were measured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions after 48 h acclimation to normoxia and hypoxia, and gill remodelling was estimated after 48 h of hypoxia exposure. Both traditional ANCOVA and phylogenetically independent contrast (PDANOVA) analyses showed that fish species from rapid-flow habitats exhibited lower LOE50 compared with fish from intermediate- and slow-flow habitats. Habitat-specific differences in Pcrit and Ucrit were detected using PDANOVA but not traditional ANCOVA analyses, with fish species from rapid-flow habitats exhibiting lower Pcrit but higher Ucrit values compared with fish from intermediate- and slow-flow habitats. Fish species from rapid-flow habitats were also characterized by less plasticity in swim performance and gill morphology in response to hypoxia acclimation compared with species from slow-flow habitats, but a greater drop in swim performance in response to acute hypoxia exposure. The study detected a habitat-specific difference in hypoxia tolerance, swimming performance and its plasticity among fish from habitats with different flow conditions, possibly because of the long-term adaptation to the habitat caused by selection stress. The PDANOVA analyses were more powerful than traditional statistical analyses according to the habitat effects in both hypoxia tolerance and swimming performance in this study."},{"title":"Context-dependent fluctuation of serotonin in the auditory midbrain: the influence of sex, reproductive state and experience","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/526","abstract":"In the face of changing behavioral situations, plasticity of sensory systems can be a valuable mechanism to facilitate appropriate behavioral responses. In the auditory system, the neurotransmitter serotonin is an important messenger for context-dependent regulation because it is sensitive to both external events and internal state, and it modulates neural activity. In male mice, serotonin increases in the auditory midbrain region, the inferior colliculus (IC), in response to changes in behavioral context such as restriction stress and social contact. Female mice have not been measured in similar contexts, although the serotonergic system is sexually dimorphic in many ways. In the present study, we investigated the effects of sex, experience and estrous state on the fluctuation of serotonin in the IC across contexts, as well as potential relationships between behavior and serotonin. Contrary to our expectation, there were no sex differences in increases of serotonin in response to a restriction stimulus. Both sexes had larger increases in second exposures, suggesting experience plays a role in serotonergic release in the IC. In females, serotonin increased during both restriction and interactions with males; however, the increase was more rapid during restriction. There was no effect of female estrous phase on the serotonergic change for either context, but serotonin was related to behavioral activity in females interacting with males. These results show that changes in behavioral context induce increases in serotonin in the IC by a mechanism that appears to be uninfluenced by sex or estrous state, but may depend on experience and behavioral activity."},{"title":"Does individual quality mask the detection of performance trade-offs? A test using analyses of human physical performance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/545","abstract":"Why are performance trade-offs so rarely detected in animals when their underlying physiological basis seems so intuitive? One possibility is that individual variation in health, fitness, nutrition, development or genetics, or ‘individual quality’, makes some individuals better or worse performers across all motor tasks. If this is the case, then correcting for individual quality should reveal functional trade-offs that might otherwise be overlooked. We tested this idea by exploring trade-offs in maximum physical performance and motor skill function in semi-professional soccer players. We assessed individual performance across five maximum ‘athletic’ tasks providing independent measures of power, stamina and speed, as well as five soccer-specific ‘motor skill’ tasks providing independent measures of foot control. We expected to find functional trade-offs between pairs of traits (e.g. endurance versus power/speed tasks or specialist–generalist performance) – but only after correcting for individual quality. Analyses of standardised raw data found positive associations among several pairs of traits, but no evidence of performance trade-offs. Indeed, peak performance across a single athletic task (degree of specialisation) was positively associated with performance averaged across all other athletic tasks (generalist). However, after accounting for an individual's overall quality, several functional trade-offs became evident. Within our quality-corrected data, 1500 m-speed (endurance) was negatively associated with squat time (power), jump distance (power) and agility speed – reflecting the expected speed–endurance trade-off; and degree of specialisation was negatively associated with average performance across tasks. Taken together, our data support the idea that individual variation in general quality can mask the detection of performance trade-offs at the whole-animal level. These results highlight the possibility that studies may spuriously conclude certain functional trade-offs are unimportant or non-existent when analyses that account for variation in general quality may reveal their cryptic presence."},{"title":"Color-dependent learning in restrained Africanized honey bees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/337","abstract":"Associative color learning has been demonstrated to be very poor using restrained European honey bees unless the antennae are amputated. Consequently, our understanding of proximate mechanisms in visual information processing is handicapped. Here we test learning performance of Africanized honey bees under restrained conditions with visual and olfactory stimulation using the proboscis extension response (PER) protocol. Restrained individuals were trained to learn an association between a color stimulus and a sugar–water reward. We evaluated performance for ‘absolute’ learning (learned association between a stimulus and a reward) and ‘discriminant’ learning (discrimination between two stimuli). Restrained Africanized honey bees (AHBs) readily learned the association of color stimulus for both blue and green LED stimuli in absolute and discriminatory learning tasks within seven presentations, but not with violet as the rewarded color. Additionally, 24-h memory improved considerably during the discrimination task, compared with absolute association (15–55%). We found that antennal amputation was unnecessary and reduced performance in AHBs. Thus color learning can now be studied using the PER protocol with intact AHBs. This finding opens the way towards investigating visual and multimodal learning with application of neural techniques commonly used in restrained honey bees."},{"title":"Figure–ground discrimination behavior in Drosophila. I. Spatial organization of wing-steering responses","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/4/558","abstract":"The behavioral algorithms and neural subsystems for visual figure–ground discrimination are not sufficiently described in any model system. The fly visual system shares structural and functional similarity with that of vertebrates and, like vertebrates, flies robustly track visual figures in the face of ground motion. This computation is crucial for animals that pursue salient objects under the high performance requirements imposed by flight behavior. Flies smoothly track small objects and use wide-field optic flow to maintain flight-stabilizing optomotor reflexes. The spatial and temporal properties of visual figure tracking and wide-field stabilization have been characterized in flies, but how the two systems interact spatially to allow flies to actively track figures against a moving ground has not. We took a systems identification approach in flying Drosophila and measured wing-steering responses to velocity impulses of figure and ground motion independently. We constructed a spatiotemporal action field (STAF) – the behavioral analog of a spatiotemporal receptive field – revealing how the behavioral impulse responses to figure tracking and concurrent ground stabilization vary for figure motion centered at each location across the visual azimuth. The figure tracking and ground stabilization STAFs show distinct spatial tuning and temporal dynamics, confirming the independence of the two systems. When the figure tracking system is activated by a narrow vertical bar moving within the frontal field of view, ground motion is essentially ignored despite comprising over 90% of the total visual input."},{"title":"Disruptive communication: stealth signaling in the toadfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/344","abstract":"Male oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, produce long duration (250 to 650 ms) sexual advertisement calls or ‘boatwhistles’ during the breeding season.

We used a membrane-based feeding system to identify chemicals that stimulate acceptance and engorgement responses in various life stages of bed bugs. Water was fortified with a variety of compounds (e.g. salts, amino acids, vitamins, nucleotides, cholesterol and fatty acids) in these bioassays. ATP was the most effective phagostimulant in adults and nymphs, resulting in >70% of bed bugs fully engorging. Addition of NaCl to low ATP solutions that alone elicited <50% engorgement significantly enhanced feeding responses of bed bugs. A comparison of feeding responses with solutions of various adenine nucleotides showed that ATP was more stimulatory than ADP, which was more effective than AMP. Feeding assays with physiological levels of other blood constituents such as d-glucose, albumin, globulin, cholesterol and mixtures of vitamins and amino acids did not stimulate engorgement, suggesting that adenine nucleotides are the most important feeding stimulants in bed bugs. Identification of phagostimulants for bed bugs will contribute towards the development of artificial diets for rearing purposes, as well as for the development of alternative methods to eliminate bed bug infestations."},{"title":"Self-supplementation and effects of dietary antioxidants during acute thermal stress","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/370","abstract":"Thermal stress leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species. If an organism is not able to simultaneously mount an efficient antioxidant defense system, this may lead to increased oxidative damage, which is potentially deleterious in terms of health and fitness. Exposure to cold or heat is therefore expected to be associated with a high demand for antioxidants. In agreement, several studies have shown that supplementing the diet of thermally stressed organisms with antioxidants leads to a reduction of oxidative damage. However, whether organisms can actively supplement their diet with antioxidants to alleviate temperature-induced oxidative damage is unknown. Here, we show that captive Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae) supplement their diet more with seeds rich in antioxidants below than within their thermoneutral zone. Moreover, having access to seeds rich in antioxidants at temperatures below thermoneutrality decreases their oxidative damage. These results indicate that, when facing a thermal challenge, animals are able to take advantage of the antioxidant properties of their food to improve their oxidative balance. Having access to food resources rich in antioxidants may therefore be of primary importance for organisms in their natural habitat, as it may help them to cope with oxidative constraints due to challenging temperature regimes."},{"title":"Equal latency contours and auditory weighting functions for the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/359","abstract":"Loudness perception by human infants and animals can be studied under the assumption that sounds of equal loudness elicit equal reaction times (RTs). Simple RTs of a harbour porpoise to narrowband frequency-modulated signals were measured using a behavioural method and an RT sensor based on infrared light. Equal latency contours, which connect equal RTs across frequencies, for reference values of 150–200 ms (10 ms intervals) were derived from median RTs to 1 s signals with sound pressure levels (SPLs) of 59–168 dB re. 1 μPa and centre frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 16, 31.5, 63, 80 and 125 kHz. The higher the signal level was above the hearing threshold of the harbour porpoise, the quicker the animal responded to the stimulus (median RT 98–522 ms). Equal latency contours roughly paralleled the hearing threshold at relatively low sensation levels (higher RTs). The difference in shape between the hearing threshold and the equal latency contours was more pronounced at higher levels (lower RTs); a flattening of the contours occurred for frequencies below 63 kHz. Relationships of the equal latency contour levels with the hearing threshold were used to create smoothed functions assumed to be representative of equal loudness contours. Auditory weighting functions were derived from these smoothed functions that may be used to predict perceived levels and correlated noise effects in the harbour porpoise, at least until actual equal loudness contours become available."},{"title":"Geared up to stretch: pennate muscle behavior during active lengthening","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/376","abstract":"Many locomotor activities require muscles to actively lengthen, dissipate energy and decelerate the body. These eccentric contractions can disrupt cytoskeletal structures within myofibrils and reduce force output. We examined how architectural features of pennate muscles can provide a protective mechanism against eccentric muscle damage by limiting fascicle lengthening. It has been previously shown that the angled fibers of pennate muscles change orientation when shortening. This change in fiber orientation can amplify fascicle shortening, resulting in a velocity advantage at the level of the muscle–tendon unit (MTU) that is characterized by a gear ratio (MTU velocity/fascicle velocity). A muscle's architectural gear ratio (AGR) has been shown to vary as a function of force during shortening, while AGR during lengthening remains largely unknown. We independently measured fascicle length and MTU length in vitro in the bullfrog plantaris. We characterized the muscle's force–velocity curve and AGR during both shortening and lengthening across a broad range of forces (10–190% peak isometric force). AGR was measured during the isotonic portion of each contraction, to eliminate possible contributions of series elasticity to MTU length changes. We found that gear ratio varies with force during both shortening and lengthening contractions. The highest AGR was observed during lengthening contractions, indicating that lengthening of the MTU can occur with relatively little stretch of the fascicle. As fascicle strain is considered an important determinant of muscle damage, a high gear ratio may afford pennate muscles protection against the damaging effects of active lengthening."},{"title":"Visual odometry in the wolf spider Lycosa tarantula (Araneae: Lycosidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/395","abstract":"The wolf spider Lycosa tarantula homes using path integration.

The ability of L. tarantula to gauge the distance walked after being displaced from its burrow was investigated using experimental channels placed in an indoor setup. Firstly, we manipulated the perception of visual stimuli by covering all the spider's eyes. Secondly, we changed the optic flow supplied by a black-and-white grating (λ=2 cm) perceived either in the lateral or in the ventral field of view. Finally, the period of the lateral or ventral grating was changed from λ=2 cm to λ=1 cm. Our results indicate that visual information contributes to distance estimation because when the spider's eyes were covered, the spiders tended to search for the burrow at very variable distances. This visual information is created by the motion of the image as the spider walks, the motion in the lateral field of view being the most important. The preference of a lateral optic flow over the ventral flow can be explained by the difference in the resolution capacity of the posterior lateral eyes and the anterior lateral eyes."},{"title":"Aerodynamics of the flying snake Chrysopelea paradisi: how a bluff body cross-sectional shape contributes to gliding performance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/382","abstract":"A prominent feature of gliding flight in snakes of the genus Chrysopelea is the unique cross-sectional shape of the body, which acts as the lifting surface in the absence of wings. When gliding, the flying snake Chrysopelea paradisi morphs its circular cross-section into a triangular shape by splaying its ribs and flattening its body in the dorsoventral axis, forming a geometry with fore–aft symmetry and a thick profile. Here, we aimed to understand the aerodynamic properties of the snake's cross-sectional shape to determine its contribution to gliding at low Reynolds numbers. We used a straight physical model in a water tunnel to isolate the effects of 2D shape, analogously to studying the profile of an airfoil of a more typical flyer. Force measurements and time-resolved (TR) digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) were used to determine lift and drag coefficients, wake dynamics and vortex-shedding characteristics of the shape across a behaviorally relevant range of Reynolds numbers and angles of attack. The snake's cross-sectional shape produced a maximum lift coefficient of 1.9 and maximum lift-to-drag ratio of 2.7, maintained increases in lift up to 35 deg, and exhibited two distinctly different vortex-shedding modes. Within the measured Reynolds number regime (Re=3000–15,000), this geometry generated significantly larger maximum lift coefficients than many other shapes including bluff bodies, thick airfoils, symmetric airfoils and circular arc airfoils. In addition, the snake's shape exhibited a gentle stall region that maintained relatively high lift production even up to the highest angle of attack tested (60 deg). Overall, the cross-sectional geometry of the flying snake demonstrated robust aerodynamic behavior by maintaining significant lift production and near-maximum lift-to-drag ratios over a wide range of parameters. These aerodynamic characteristics help to explain how the snake can glide at steep angles and over a wide range of angles of attack, but more complex models that account for 3D effects and the dynamic movements of aerial undulation are required to fully understand the gliding performance of flying snakes."},{"title":"Jumping mechanisms in dictyopharid planthoppers (Hemiptera, Dicytyopharidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/402","abstract":"The jumping performance of four species of hemipterans belonging to the family Dictyopharidae, from Europe, South Africa and Australia, were analysed from high-speed images. The body shape in all was characterised by an elongated and tapering head that gave a streamlined appearance. The body size ranged from 6 to 9 mm in length and from 6 to 23 mg in mass. The hind legs were 80–90% of body length and 30–50% longer than the front legs, except in one species in which the front legs were particularly large so that all legs were of similar length. Jumping was propelled by rapid and simultaneous depression of the trochantera of both hind legs, powered by large muscles in the thorax, and was accompanied by extension of the tibiae. In the best jumps, defined as those with the fastest take-off velocity, Engela minuta accelerated in 1.2 ms to a take-off velocity of 5.8 m s−1, which is the fastest achieved by any insect described to date. During such a jump, E. minuta experienced an acceleration of 4830 m s−2 or 490 g, while other species in the same family experienced 225–375 g. The best jumps in all species required an energy expenditure of 76–225 μJ, a power output of 12–80 mW and exerted a force of 12–29 mN. The required power output per mass of jumping muscle ranged from 28,000 to 140,200 W kg−1 muscle and thus greatly exceeded the maximum active contractile limit of normal muscle. To achieve such a jumping performance, these insects must be using a power amplification mechanism in a catapult-like action. It is suggested that their streamlined body shape improves jumping performance by reducing drag, which, for a small insect, can substantially affect forward momentum."},{"title":"Disruptive communication: stealth signaling in the toadfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/344","abstract":"Male oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, produce long duration (250 to 650 ms) sexual advertisement calls or ‘boatwhistles’ during the breeding season.

However, whether organisms can actively supplement their diet with antioxidants to alleviate temperature-induced oxidative damage is unknown. Here, we show that captive Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae) supplement their diet more with seeds rich in antioxidants below than within their thermoneutral zone. Moreover, having access to seeds rich in antioxidants at temperatures below thermoneutrality decreases their oxidative damage. These results indicate that, when facing a thermal challenge, animals are able to take advantage of the antioxidant properties of their food to improve their oxidative balance. Having access to food resources rich in antioxidants may therefore be of primary importance for organisms in their natural habitat, as it may help them to cope with oxidative constraints due to challenging temperature regimes."},{"title":"Equal latency contours and auditory weighting functions for the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/359","abstract":"Loudness perception by human infants and animals can be studied under the assumption that sounds of equal loudness elicit equal reaction times (RTs). Simple RTs of a harbour porpoise to narrowband frequency-modulated signals were measured using a behavioural method and an RT sensor based on infrared light. Equal latency contours, which connect equal RTs across frequencies, for reference values of 150–200 ms (10 ms intervals) were derived from median RTs to 1 s signals with sound pressure levels (SPLs) of 59–168 dB re. 1 μPa and centre frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 16, 31.5, 63, 80 and 125 kHz. The higher the signal level was above the hearing threshold of the harbour porpoise, the quicker the animal responded to the stimulus (median RT 98–522 ms). Equal latency contours roughly paralleled the hearing threshold at relatively low sensation levels (higher RTs). The difference in shape between the hearing threshold and the equal latency contours was more pronounced at higher levels (lower RTs); a flattening of the contours occurred for frequencies below 63 kHz. Relationships of the equal latency contour levels with the hearing threshold were used to create smoothed functions assumed to be representative of equal loudness contours. Auditory weighting functions were derived from these smoothed functions that may be used to predict perceived levels and correlated noise effects in the harbour porpoise, at least until actual equal loudness contours become available."},{"title":"Color-dependent learning in restrained Africanized honey bees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/337","abstract":"Associative color learning has been demonstrated to be very poor using restrained European honey bees unless the antennae are amputated. Consequently, our understanding of proximate mechanisms in visual information processing is handicapped. Here we test learning performance of Africanized honey bees under restrained conditions with visual and olfactory stimulation using the proboscis extension response (PER) protocol. Restrained individuals were trained to learn an association between a color stimulus and a sugar–water reward. We evaluated performance for ‘absolute’ learning (learned association between a stimulus and a reward) and ‘discriminant’ learning (discrimination between two stimuli). Restrained Africanized honey bees (AHBs) readily learned the association of color stimulus for both blue and green LED stimuli in absolute and discriminatory learning tasks within seven presentations, but not with violet as the rewarded color. Additionally, 24-h memory improved considerably during the discrimination task, compared with absolute association (15–55%). We found that antennal amputation was unnecessary and reduced performance in AHBs. Thus color learning can now be studied using the PER protocol with intact AHBs. This finding opens the way towards investigating visual and multimodal learning with application of neural techniques commonly used in restrained honey bees."},{"title":"Allometry of skull morphology, gape size and ingestion performance in the banded watersnake (Nerodia fasciata) feeding on two types of prey","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/472","abstract":"Small body size imposes limitations on the feeding capabilities of juveniles, particularly in species that consume their prey whole. It has been hypothesized that juveniles exhibit exceptional performance measures to compensate for their small size. However, few studies have examined whether juveniles have better feeding performance relative to adults and investigations of snake feeding ontogeny have not shown enhanced performance in smaller snakes. I tested the hypothesis that juvenile snakes have better feeding performance by comparing maximum gape circumference and ingestion performance (time and number of pterygoid protractions) in a series of banded watersnakes (Nerodia fasciata) of different sizes fed fish and frogs. I also measured several external and osteological dimensions of the head and used Akaike's information criterion to determine which morphological measurements were the strongest predictors of relative gape. All skull measurements and maximum gape circumference showed negative allometry relative to snout–vent length (SVL). Given the available models, Akaike information criterion (AIC) analysis indicated that both skull length and mandible length were the strongest predictors of gape circumference for both external and osteological measurements. Multiple regression analysis of ingestion performance indicated SVL was negatively correlated with the time and number of pterygoid protractions required to consume fish or frogs, indicating that juveniles do not have a higher ingestion performance than adults. While exaggerated morphology in juvenile snakes does not appear to improve ingestion performance, a larger gape should increase the ability of juvenile snakes to consume a wide range of encountered prey shapes and sizes."},{"title":"Hearing pathways in the Yangtze finless porpoise, Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/444","abstract":"How an animal receives sound may influence its use of sound. While ‘jaw hearing’ is well supported for odontocetes, work examining how sound is received across the head has been limited to a few representative species. The substantial variation in jaw and head morphology among odontocetes suggests variation in sound reception. Here, we address how a divergent subspecies, the Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) hears low-, mid- and high-frequency tones, as well as broadband clicks, comparing sounds presented at different locations across the head. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). Click and tone stimuli (8, 54 and 120 kHz) were presented at nine locations on the head and body using a suction-cup transducer. Threshold differences were compared between frequencies and locations, and referenced to the underlying anatomy using computed tomography (CT) imaging of deceased animals of the same subspecies. The best hearing locations with minimum thresholds were found adjacent to a mandibular fat pad and overlaying the auditory bulla. Mean thresholds were not substantially different at locations from the rostrum tip to the ear (11.6 dB). This contrasts with tests with bottlenose dolphins and beluga whales, in which 30–40 dB threshold differences were found across the animals' heads. Response latencies increased with decreasing response amplitudes, which suggests that latency and sensitivity are interrelated when considering sound reception across the odontocete head. The results suggest that there are differences among odontocetes in the anatomy related to receiving sound, and porpoises may have relatively less acoustic ‘shadowing’."},{"title":"Interactive effects of competition and predator cues on immune responses of leopard frogs at metamorphosis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/351","abstract":"Recent hypotheses suggest that immunosuppression, resulting from altered environmental conditions, may contribute to the increased incidence of amphibian disease around the world. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in amphibian skin are an important innate immune defense against fungal, viral and bacterial pathogens. Their release is tightly coupled with release of the stress hormone noradrenaline (norepinephrine). During metamorphosis, AMPs may constitute the primary immune response in the skin of some species because acquired immune functions are temporarily suppressed in order to prevent autoimmunity against new adult antigens. Suppression of AMPs during this transitional stage may impact disease rates. We exposed leopard frog tadpoles (Lithobates pipiens) to a factorial combination of competitor and caged-predator environments and measured their development, growth and production of hydrophobic skin peptides after metamorphosis. In the absence of predator cues, or if the exposure to predator cues was late in ontogeny, competition caused more than a 250% increase in mass-standardized hydrophobic skin peptides. Predator cues caused a decrease in mass-standardized hydrophobic skin peptides when the exposure was late in ontogeny under low competition, but otherwise had no effect. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of the skin peptides showed that they include six AMPs in the brevinin and temporin families and at least three of these peptides are previously uncharacterized. Both of these peptide families have previously been shown to inhibit harmful microbes including Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the fungal pathogen associated with global amphibian declines. Our study shows that amphibians may be able to adjust their skin peptide defenses in response to stressors that are experienced early in ontogeny and that these effects extend through an important life-history transition."},{"title":"Pharmacological characterization of NMDA-like receptors in the single-celled organism Paramecium primaurelia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/3/463","abstract":"Paramecium primaurelia is a unicellular eukaryote that moves in freshwater by ciliary beating and responds to environmental stimuli by altering motile behaviour. The movements of the cilia are controlled by the electrical changes of the cell membrane: when the intraciliary Ca2+ concentration associated with plasma membrane depolarization increases, the ciliary beating reverses its direction, and consequently the swimming direction changes. The ciliary reversal duration is correlated with the amount of Ca2+ influx. Here, we evaluated the effects due to the activation or blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors on swimming behaviour in Paramecium. Paramecia normally swim forward, drawing almost linear tracks. We observed that the simultaneous administration of NMDA and glycine induced a partial ciliary reversal (PaCR) leading to a continuous spiral-like swim. Furthermore, the duration of continuous ciliary reversal (CCR), triggered by high external KCl concentrations, was longer in NMDA+glycine-treated cells. NMDA action required the presence of Ca2+, as the normal forward swimming was restored when the ion was omitted from the extracellular milieu. The PaCR and the enhancement of CCR duration significantly decreased when the antagonists of the glutamate site D-AP5 or CGS19755, the NMDA channel blocker MK-801 or the glycine site antagonist DCKA was added. The action of NMDA+glycine was also abolished by Zn2+ or ifenprodil, the GluN2A and the GluN2B NMDA-containing subunit blockers, respectively. Searches of the Paramecium genome database currently available indicate that the NMDA-like receptor with ligand-binding characteristics of an NMDA receptor-like complex, purified from rat brain synaptic membranes and found in some metazoan genomes, is also present in Paramecium. These results provide evidence that functional NMDA receptors similar to those typical of mammalian neuronal cells are present in the single-celled organism Paramecium and thus suggest that the glutamatergic NMDA system is a phylogenetically old behaviour-controlling mechanism."},{"title":"Eco-mechanics of lamellar autotomy in larval damselflies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/185","abstract":"In larval damselflies, the self-amputation (autotomy) of the caudal lamellae permits escape from predatory larval dragonflies. Lamellar joint size declines among populations with increasing risk of dragonfly predation, but the breaking force required for autotomy and the biomechanical factors that influence breaking force are unknown. If autotomy enhances survival in larval damselflies, then predation by larval dragonflies should select for joints that require less force to break. We test this adaptive hypothesis by evaluating whether breaking force is negatively related to local predation risk from larval dragonflies. We also test a cuticle structure hypothesis, which predicts that breaking force is positively related to joint size and to joint cuticle thickness because of a structural support relationship between joint and lamella. The peak force necessary for lamellar autotomy was assessed on individual larval Enallagma damselflies collected from populations that varied in risk of predation. Easier lamellar autotomy occurred in larvae from sites with higher predation risk because damselflies from fishless ponds (where predatory larval dragonflies are likely more abundant) had lower breaking forces than those from ponds with fish (where larval dragonfly predation is likely reduced). Furthermore, breaking force was a positive function of joint size and also of total cuticle cross-sectional area after controlling for joint size. This suggests that autotomy may evolve in larval damselflies under selection from small grasping predators such as larval dragonflies by favouring smaller joint size or reduced cuticle area of lamellar joints."},{"title":"Functional implications of ontogenetically and sexually dimorphic dentition in the eastern shovelnose ray, Aptychotrema rostrata","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/192","abstract":"Unlike other elasmobranchs, batoids exhibit sexually dimorphic dentition. The functional implications of such dentition, however, remain understudied. For the present study, ontogenetic and sexual dimorphism in tooth and jaw structure, together with the functional implications of this dimorphism, were determined in the eastern shovelnose ray, Aptychotrema rostrata. Sexually dimorphic dentition and jaw structure was first observed in sub-adult age classes, with males developing a pronounced lower jaw at the symphysis. Monognathic heterodonty was prominent in mature males, with teeth in the symphyseal region developing significantly greater heights and sharpness ratios in comparison to females. Ex vivo mechanical grip strength tests were used to determine simulated bite-grip tenacity. The mean peak pull-out forces required to withdraw a section of a dissected pectoral fin from between jaws closed with a constant occlusal force was highest for mature males, intermediate for mature females and lowest for immature females and males. Although the species exhibits ontogenetic variations in diet, these were unrelated to sex. Rather, the larger and highly cuspidate teeth of mature males increased the bite-grip tenacity, which likely aids in copulation."},{"title":"Undulating fins produce off-axis thrust and flow structures","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/201","abstract":"While wake structures of many forms of swimming and flying are well characterized, the wake generated by a freely swimming undulating fin has not yet been analyzed. These elongated fins allow fish to achieve enhanced agility exemplified by the forward, backward and vertical swimming capabilities of knifefish, and also have potential applications in the design of more maneuverable underwater vehicles. We present the flow structure of an undulating robotic fin model using particle image velocimetry to measure fluid velocity fields in the wake. We supplement the experimental robotic work with high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics, simulating the hydrodynamics of both a virtual fish, whose fin kinematics and fin plus body morphology are measured from a freely swimming knifefish, and a virtual rendering of our robot. Our results indicate that a series of linked vortex tubes is shed off the long edge of the fin as the undulatory wave travels lengthwise along the fin. A jet at an oblique angle to the fin is associated with the successive vortex tubes, propelling the fish forward. The vortex structure bears similarity to the linked vortex ring structure trailing the oscillating caudal fin of a carangiform swimmer, though the vortex rings are distorted because of the undulatory kinematics of the elongated fin."},{"title":"The whole is more than the sum of all its parts: collective effect of spider attachment organs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/222","abstract":"Dynamic attachment is the key to moving safely and fast in a three-dimensional environment. Among lizards, hexapods and arachnids, several lineages have evolved hairy foot pads that can generate strong friction and adhesion on both smooth and rough surfaces. A strongly expressed directionality of attachment structures results in an anisotropy of frictional properties, which might be crucial for attachment control. In a natural situation, more than one leg is usually in contact with the substrate. In order to understand the collective effect of hairy foot pads in the hunting spider Cupiennius salei (Arachnida, Ctenidae), we performed vertical pulling experiments combined with stepwise disabling of the pads. We found the attachment force of the spider to be not simply the sum of single leg forces because with leg pair deactivation a much greater decrease in attachment forces was found than was predicted by just the loss of available adhesive pad area. This indicates that overall adhesion ability of the spider is strongly dependent on the antagonistic work of opposing legs, and the apparent contact area plays only a minor role. It is concluded that the coordinated action of the legs is crucial for adhesion control and for fast and easy detachment. The cumulative effect of anisotropic fibrillar adhesive structures could be potentially interesting for biomimetic applications, such as novel gripping devices."},{"title":"Isotope turnover rates and diet–tissue discrimination in skin of ex situ bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/214","abstract":"Diet–tissue discrimination factors (Δ15N or Δ13C) and turnover times are thought to be influenced by a wide range of variables including metabolic rate, age, dietary quality, tissue sampled and the taxon being investigated. In the present study, skin samples were collected from ex situ dolphins that had consumed diets of known isotopic composition for a minimum of 8 weeks. Adult dolphins consuming a diet of low fat (5–6%) and high δ15N value had significantly lower Δ15N values than animals consuming a diet with high fat (13.9%) and low δ15N value. Juvenile dolphins consuming a diet with low fat and an intermediate δ15N value had significantly higher Δ15N values than adults consuming the same diet. Calculated half-lives for δ15N ranged from 14 to 23 days (17.2±1.3 days). Half-lives for δ13C ranged from 11 to 23 days with a significant difference between low fat (13.9±4.8 days) and high fat diets (22.0±0.5 days). Overall, our results indicate that while assuming a Δ13C value of 1‰ may be appropriate for cetaceans, Δ15N values may be closer to 1.5‰ rather than the commonly assumed 3‰. Our data also suggest that understanding seasonal variability in prey composition is another significant consideration when applying discrimination factors or turnover times to field studies focused on feeding habits. Isotope retention times of only a few weeks suggest that, in addition, these isotope data could play an important role in interpreting recent fine-scale habitat utilization and residency patterns."},{"title":"Falcons pursue prey using visual motion cues: new perspectives from animal-borne cameras","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/225","abstract":"This study reports on experiments on falcons wearing miniature videocameras mounted on their backs or heads while pursuing flying prey. Videos of hunts by a gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), gyrfalcon (F. rusticolus)/Saker falcon (F. cherrug) hybrids and peregrine falcons (F. peregrinus) were analyzed to determine apparent prey positions on their visual fields during pursuits. These video data were then interpreted using computer simulations of pursuit steering laws observed in insects and mammals. A comparison of the empirical and modeling data indicates that falcons use cues due to the apparent motion of prey on the falcon's visual field to track and capture flying prey via a form of motion camouflage. The falcons also were found to maintain their prey's image at visual angles consistent with using their shallow fovea. These results should prove relevant for understanding the co-evolution of pursuit and evasion, as well as the development of computer models of predation and the integration of sensory and locomotion systems in biomimetic robots."},{"title":"Aerobic scope does not predict the performance of a tropical eurythermal fish at elevated temperatures","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/244","abstract":"Climate warming is predicted to negatively impact fish populations through impairment of oxygen transport systems when temperatures exceed those which are optimal for aerobic scope (AS). This concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) is rapidly gaining popularity within climate change research and has been applied to several fish species. Here, we evaluated the relevance of aerobic performance of juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in the context of thermal preference and tolerance by (1) measuring standard and maximum metabolic rates (SMR and MMR, respectively) and AS of fish acclimated to 29°C and acutely exposed to temperatures from 23 to 38°C, (2) allowing the fish to behaviourally select a preferred temperature between 29 and 38°C, and (3) quantifying alterations to AS after 5 weeks of acclimation to 29 and 38°C. SMR and MMR both increased continuously with temperature in acutely exposed fish, but the increase was greater for MMR such that AS was highest at 38°C, a temperature approaching the upper lethal limit (40–41°C). Despite 38°C eliciting maximum AS, when given the opportunity the fish selected a median temperature of 31.7±0.5°C and spent only 10±3% of their time at temperatures >36°C. Following acclimation to 38°C, AS measured at 38°C was decreased to the same level as 29°C-acclimated fish measured at 29°C, suggesting that AS may be dynamically modulated independent of temperature to accommodate the requirements of daily life. Together, these results reveal limited power of the OCLTT hypothesis in predicting optimal temperatures and effects of climate warming on juvenile barramundi."},{"title":"Seasonal changes in the behaviour and respiration physiology of the freshwater duck mussel, Anodonta anatina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/235","abstract":"For low-energy organisms such as bivalves, the costs of thermal compensation of biological rates (synonymous with acclimation or acclimatization) may be higher than the benefits. We therefore conducted two experiments to examine the effect of seasonal temperature changes on behaviour and oxygen consumption. In the first experiment, we examined the effects of seasonal temperature changes on the freshwater bivalve Anodonta anatina, taking measurements each month for a year at the corresponding temperature for that time of year. There was no evidence for compensation of burrowing valve closure duration or frequency, or locomotory speed. In the second experiment, we compared A. anatina at summer and winter temperatures (24 and 4°C, respectively) and found no evidence for compensation of the burrowing rate, valve closure duration or frequency, or oxygen consumption rates during burrowing, immediately after valve closure or at rest. Within the experimental limits of this study, the evidence suggests that thermal compensation of biological rates is not a strategy employed by A. anatina. We argue that this is due to either a lack of evolutionary pressure to acclimatize, or evolutionary pressure to not acclimatize. Firstly, there is little incentive to increase metabolic rate to enhance predatory ability given that these are filter feeders. Secondly, maintained low energetic demand, enhanced at winter temperatures, is essential for predator avoidance, i.e. valve closure. Thus, we suggest that the costs of acclimatization outweigh the benefits in A. anatina."},{"title":"Measurement of hydrodynamic force generation by swimming dolphins using bubble DPIV","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/252","abstract":"Attempts to measure the propulsive forces produced by swimming dolphins have been limited. Previous uses of computational hydrodynamic models and gliding experiments have provided estimates of thrust production by dolphins, but these were indirect tests that relied on various assumptions. The thrust produced by two actively swimming bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) was directly measured using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). For dolphins swimming in a large outdoor pool, the DPIV method used illuminated microbubbles that were generated in a narrow sheet from a finely porous hose and a compressed air source. The movement of the bubbles was tracked with a high-speed video camera. Dolphins swam at speeds of 0.7 to 3.4 m s−1 within the bubble sheet oriented along the midsagittal plane of the animal. The wake of the dolphin was visualized as the microbubbles were displaced because of the action of the propulsive flukes and jet flow. The oscillations of the dolphin flukes were shown to generate strong vortices in the wake. Thrust production was measured from the vortex strength through the Kutta–Joukowski theorem of aerodynamics. The dolphins generated up to 700 N during small amplitude swimming and up to 1468 N during large amplitude starts. The results of this study demonstrated that bubble DPIV can be used effectively to measure the thrust produced by large-bodied dolphins."},{"title":"Non-stressful temperature effect on oxidative balance and life history traits in adult fish (Oryzias latipes)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/274","abstract":"Temperature is well known to affect many biological and ecological traits, especially in ectotherms. From a physiological point of view, temperature is also positively correlated to metabolism and is often associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. It has recently been suggested that ROS play a role in lifespan and resource allocation. However, only a few authors have attempted to explore the relationships between temperature, resource allocation and oxidative balance in ectotherms. Here, we measured the effect of temperature on growth, reproductive effort, offspring quantity and quality, hatching and survival rates, and the associated proximal costs, which were evaluated through the quantification of oxidative balance elements. We reared adult fish (Oryzias latipes) at two non-stressful temperatures (20 and 30°C) during a relatively long period (4 months, approximately the entire adult life). The results show a trade-off between reproduction and maintenance because investment toward growth could be neglected at the adult stage (confirmed by our results). Intriguingly, ROS-dependent damages did not differ between the two groups, probably because of the higher rate of activation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase for warm-acclimated fish. The allocation toward antioxidant defences is associated with an earlier reproduction and a lower quality of offspring. These interesting results bring new perspectives in terms of the prediction of the impact of global warming on biota through the use of ecological theories based on oxidative balance and metabolism."},{"title":"Comparison of rotator cuff muscle architecture between humans and other selected vertebrate species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/261","abstract":"In this study, we compare rotator cuff muscle architecture of typically used animal models with that of humans and quantify the scaling relationships of these muscles across mammals. The four muscles that correspond to the human rotator cuff – supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis and teres minor – of 10 commonly studied animals were excised and subjected to a series of comparative measurements. When body mass among animals was regressed against physiological cross-sectional area, muscle mass and normalized fiber length, the confidence intervals suggested geometric scaling but did not exclude other scaling relationships. Based on the architectural difference index (ADI), a combined measure of fiber length-to-moment arm ratio, fiber length-to-muscle length ratio and the fraction of the total rotator cuff physiological cross-sectional area contributed by each muscle, chimpanzees were found to be the most similar to humans (ADI=2.15), followed closely by capuchins (ADI=2.16). Interestingly, of the eight non-primates studied, smaller mammals such as mice, rats and dogs were more similar to humans in architectural parameters compared with larger mammals such as sheep, pigs or cows. The force production versus velocity trade-off (indicated by fiber length-to-moment arm ratio) and the excursion ability (indicated by fiber length-to-muscle length ratio) of humans were also most similar to those of primates, followed by the small mammals. Overall, primates provide the best architectural representation of human muscle architecture. However, based on the muscle architectural parameters of non-primates, smaller rather than larger mammals may be better models for studying muscles related to the human rotator cuff."},{"title":"Gecko toe and lamellar shear adhesion on macroscopic, engineered rough surfaces","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/283","abstract":"The role in adhesion of the toes and lamellae – intermediate-sized structures – found on the gecko foot remains unclear. Insight into the function of these structures can lead to a more general understanding of the hierarchical nature of the gecko adhesive system, but in particular how environmental topology may relate to gecko foot morphology. We sought to discern the mechanics of the toes and lamellae by examining gecko adhesion on controlled, macroscopically rough surfaces. We used live Tokay geckos, Gekko gecko, to observe the maximum shear force a gecko foot can attain on an engineered substrate constructed with sinusoidal patterns of varying amplitudes and wavelengths in sizes similar to the dimensions of the toes and lamellae structures (0.5 to 6 mm). We found shear adhesion was significantly decreased on surfaces that had amplitudes and wavelengths approaching the lamella length and inter-lamella spacing, losing 95% of shear adhesion over the range tested. We discovered that the toes are capable of adhering to surfaces with amplitudes much larger than their dimensions even without engaging claws, maintaining 60% of shear adhesion on surfaces with amplitudes of 3 mm. Gecko adhesion can be predicted by the ratio of the lamella dimensions to surface feature dimensions. In addition to setae, remarkable macroscopic-scale features of gecko toes and lamellae that include compliance and passive conformation are necessary to maintain contact, and consequently, generate shear adhesion on macroscopically rough surfaces. Findings on the larger scale structures in the hierarchy of gecko foot function could provide the biological inspiration to drive the design of more effective and versatile synthetic fibrillar adhesives."},{"title":"An embryonic myosin converter domain influences Drosophila indirect flight muscle stretch activation, power generation and flight","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/290","abstract":"Stretch activation (SA) is critical to the flight ability of insects powered by asynchronous, indirect flight muscles (IFMs). An essential muscle protein component for SA and power generation is myosin. Which structural domains of myosin are significant for setting SA properties and power generation levels is poorly understood. We made use of the transgenic techniques and unique single muscle myosin heavy chain gene of Drosophila to test the influence of the myosin converter domain on IFM SA and power generation. Replacing the endogenous converter with an embryonic version decreased SA tension and the rate of SA tension generation. The alterations in SA properties and myosin kinetics from the converter exchange caused power generation to drop to 10% of control fiber power when the optimal conditions for control fibers – 1% muscle length (ML) amplitude and 150 Hz oscillation frequency – were applied to fibers expressing the embryonic converter (IFI-EC). Optimizing conditions for IFI-EC fiber power production, by doubling ML amplitude and decreasing oscillation frequency by 60%, improved power output to 60% of optimized control fiber power. IFI-EC flies altered their aerodynamic flight characteristics to better match optimal fiber power generation conditions as wing beat frequency decreased and wing stroke amplitude increased. This enabled flight in spite of the drastic changes to fiber mechanical performance."},{"title":"Acute heat tolerance of cardiac excitation in the brown trout (Salmo trutta fario)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/2/299","abstract":"The upper thermal tolerance and mechanisms of heat-induced cardiac failure in the brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) was examined. The point above which ion channel function and sinoatrial contractility in vitro, and electrocardiogram (ECG) in vivo, started to fail (break point temperature, BPT) was determined by acute temperature increases. In general, electrical excitation of the heart was most sensitive to heat in the intact animal (electrocardiogram, ECG) and least sensitive in isolated cardiac myocytes (ion currents). BPTs of Ca2+ and K+ currents of cardiac myocytes were much higher (>28°C) than BPT of in vivo heart rate (23.5±0.6°C) (P<0.05). A striking exception among sarcolemmal ion conductances was the Na+ current (INa), which was the most heat-sensitive molecular function, with a BPT of 20.9±0.5°C. The low heat tolerance of INa was reflected as a low BPT for the rate of action potential upstroke in vitro (21.7±1.2°C) and the velocity of impulse transmission in vivo (21.9±2.2°C). These findings from different levels of biological organization strongly suggest that heat-dependent deterioration of Na+ channel function disturbs normal spread of electrical excitation over the heart, leading to progressive variability of cardiac rhythmicity (missed beats, bursts of fast beating), reduction of heart rate and finally cessation of the normal heartbeat. Among the cardiac ion currents INa is ‘the weakest link’ and possibly a limiting factor for upper thermal tolerance of electrical excitation in the brown trout heart. Heat sensitivity of INa may result from functional requirements for very high flux rates and fast gating kinetics of the Na+ channels, i.e. a trade-off between high catalytic activity and thermal stability."},{"title":"Inflammatory challenge increases measures of oxidative stress in a free-ranging, long-lived mammal","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4514","abstract":"Oxidative stress – the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutralising antioxidants – has been under debate as the main cause of ageing in aerobial organisms. The level of ROS should increase during infection as part of the activation of an immune response, leading to oxidative damage to proteins, lipids and DNA. Yet, it is unknown how long-lived organisms, especially mammals, cope with oxidative stress. Bats are known to carry a variety of zoonotic pathogens and at the same time are, despite their high mass-specific basal metabolic rate, unusually long lived, which may be partly the result of low oxidative damage of organs. Here, we asked whether an immune challenge causes oxidative stress in free-ranging bats, measuring two oxidative stress markers. We injected 20 short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia perspicillata) with bacterially derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 20 individuals with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) as a control. Individuals injected with LPS showed an immune reaction by increased white blood cell count after 24 h, whereas there was no significant change in leukocyte count in control animals. The biological antioxidant potential (BAP) remained the same in both groups, but reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) increased after treatment with LPS, indicating a significant increase in oxidative stress in animals when mounting an immune reaction toward the inflammatory challenge. Control individuals did not show a change in oxidative stress markers. We conclude that in a long-lived mammal, even high concentrations of antioxidants do not immediately neutralise free radicals produced during a cellular immune response. Thus, fighting an infection may lead to oxidative stress in bats."},{"title":"Pattern- and contrast-dependent visual response in the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4520","abstract":"Cubomedusae possess a total of 24 eyes, some of which are structurally similar to vertebrate eyes.

Further, there are indications that obstacle avoidance requires image information from the lower lens eye. Here we use a behavioural assay to examine the obstacle avoidance behaviour of the Caribbean cubomedusa Tripedalia cystophora and test whether it requires spatial resolution. The possible influence of the contrast and orientation of the obstacles is also examined. We show that the medusae can only perform the behaviour when spatial information is present, and fail to avoid a uniformly dark wall, directly proving the use of spatial vision. We also show that the medusae respond stronger to high contrast lines than to low contrast lines in a graded fashion, and propose that the medusae use contrast as a semi-reliable measure of distance to the obstacle."},{"title":"Phylogenetic analysis of mammalian maximal oxygen consumption during exercise","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4712","abstract":"We compiled published values of mammalian maximum oxygen consumption during exercise (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/216/24/4712/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>) and supplemented these data with new measurements of <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/216/24/4712/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/> for the largest rodent (capybara), 20 species of smaller-bodied rodents, two species of weasels and one small marsupial.

This new procedure combines a method for removing the aqueous coating of the fibres and a technique that allows the accurate measurement of their cross-sectional area. Comparison of the tensile behaviour of different samples indicated that naturally spun viscid lines show a large variability, comparable to that of other silks, such as major ampullate gland silk and silkworm silk. Nevertheless, application of a statistical analysis allowed the identification of two independent parameters that underlie the variability and characterize the observed range of true stress–true strain curves. The combination of this result with previous mechanical and microstructural data suggested the assignment of these two independent effects to the degree of alignment of the protein chains and to the local relative humidity, which, in turn, depends on the composition of the viscous coating and on the external environmental conditions."},{"title":"Locomotion- and mechanics-mediated tactile sensing: antenna reconfiguration simplifies control during high-speed navigation in cockroaches","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4530","abstract":"Animals can expend energy to acquire sensory information by emitting signals and/or moving sensory structures. We propose that the energy from locomotion itself could permit control of a sensor, whereby animals use the energy from movement to reconfigure a passive sensor. We investigated high-speed, antenna-mediated tactile navigation in the cockroach Periplaneta americana. We discovered that the passive antennal flagellum can assume two principal mechanical states, such that the tip is either projecting backward or forward. Using a combination of behavioral and robotic experiments, we demonstrate that a switch in the antenna's state is mediated via the passive interactions between the sensor and its environment, and this switch strongly influences wall-tracking control. When the tip of the antenna is projected backward, the animals maintain greater body-to-wall distance with fewer body collisions and less leg–wall contact than when the tip is projecting forward. We hypothesized that distally pointing mechanosensory hairs at the tip of the antenna mediate the switch in state by interlocking with asperities in the wall surface. To test this hypothesis, we performed laser ablation of chemo-mechanosensory hairs and added artificial hairs to a robotic antenna. In both the natural and artificial systems, the presence of hairs categorically increased an antenna's probability of switching state. Antennal hairs, once thought to only play a role in sensing, are sufficient for mechanically reconfiguring the state of the entire antenna when coupled with forward motion. We show that the synergy between antennal mechanics, locomotion and the environment simplifies tactile sensing."},{"title":"Complex response in size-related traits of bulb mites (Rhizoglyphus robini) under elevated thermal conditions – an experimental evolution approach","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4542","abstract":"Temperature is a key environmental factor affecting almost all aspects of life history in ectotherms. Theory predicts that they grow faster, reach smaller sizes and produce smaller offspring when temperature increases. In addition, temperature changes, through their effects on metabolism, may also influence the expression of alternative reproductive phenotypes (ARPs) in ectotherms. Although many studies have investigated the phenotypic plasticity of life history traits in relation to temperature change, little is known about how those traits and phenotypic plasticity may evolve together. In our study we subjected bulb mites (non-model, soil organisms that normally experience rather stable thermal conditions) to experimental evolution in two temperature treatments: control (24°C) and elevated (28°C). After 18 generations, we measured adult body size, egg size and development time of both treatments at control as well as at elevated temperatures (test temperatures). Thus, we were able to detect genetic changes (the effects of selection temperature) and environmental effects (the effects of test temperature). We also observed the ARP expression throughout the experimental evolution. Our results revealed quite complex patterns of life history in traits response to temperature. Mites developed faster and reached smaller sizes at increased temperature, but evolutionary responses to increased temperature were not always parallel to the observed phenotypic plasticity. Additionally, despite smaller body sizes, females laid larger eggs at higher temperature. This effect was more pronounced in animals evolving at elevated temperature. Evolution at increased temperature also affected ARP expression, with the proportion of armored fighters decreasing from generation to generation. We propose that this could be the consequence of temperature sensitivity of the cost-to-benefits ratio of expressing ARPs."},{"title":"Lactate kinetics of rainbow trout during graded exercise: do catheters affect the cost of transport?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4549","abstract":"Changes in lactate kinetics as a function of exercise intensity have never been measured in an ectotherm. Continuous infusion of a tracer is necessary to quantify rates of lactate appearance (Ra) and disposal (Rd), but it requires double catheterization, which could interfere with swimming. Using rainbow trout, our goals were to: (1) determine the potential effects of catheters and blood sampling on metabolic rate (ṀO2), total cost of transport (TCOT), net cost of transport (NCOT) and critical swimming speed (Ucrit), and (2) monitor changes in lactate fluxes during prolonged, steady-state swimming or graded swimming from rest to Ucrit. This athletic species maintains high baseline lactate fluxes of 24 μmol kg−1 min−1 that are only increased at intensities >2.4 body lengths (BL) s−1 or 85% Ucrit. As the fish reaches Ucrit, Ra is more strongly stimulated (+67% to 40.4 μmol kg−1 min−1) than Rd (+41% to 34.7 μmol kg−1 min−1), causing a fourfold increase in blood lactate concentration. Without this stimulation of Rd during intense swimming, lactate accumulation would double. By contrast, steady-state exercise at 1.7 BL s−1 increases lactate fluxes to ~30 μmol kg−1 min−1, with a trivial mismatch between Ra and Rd that only affects blood concentration minimally. Results also show that the catheterizations and blood sampling needed to measure metabolite kinetics in exercising fish have no significant impact on ṀO2 or TCOT. However, these experimental procedures affect locomotion energetics by increasing NCOT at high speeds and by decreasing Ucrit."},{"title":"Drastic reorganization of the bioconvection pattern of Chlamydomonas: quantitative analysis of the pattern transition response","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4557","abstract":"Motile aquatic microorganisms are known to self-organize into bioconvection patterns. The swimming activity of a population of microorganisms leads to the emergence of macroscopic patterns of density under the influence of gravity. Although long-term development of the bioconvection pattern is important in order to elucidate the possible integration of physiological functions of individuals through bioconvection pattern formation, little quantitative investigation has been carried out. In the present paper, we present the first quantitative description of long-term behavior of bioconvection of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, particularly focusing on the ‘pattern transition response’. The pattern transition response is a sudden breakdown of the steady bioconvection pattern followed by re-formation of the pattern with a decreased wavelength. We found three phases in the pattern formation of the bioconvection of C. reinhardtii: onset, steady-state 1 (before the transition) and steady-state 2 (after the transition). In onset, the wavelength of the bioconvection pattern increases with increasing depth, but not in steady-states 1 or 2. By means of the newly developed two-axis view method, we revealed that the population of C. reinhardtii moves toward the bottom of the experimental chamber just before the pattern transition. This indicates that the pattern transition response could be caused by enhancement of the gyrotaxis of C. reinhardtii as a result of the changes in the balance between the gravitactic and gyrotactic torques. We also found that the bioconvection pattern changes in response to the intensity of red-light illumination, to which C. reinhardtii is phototactically insensitive. These facts suggest that the bioconvection pattern has a potential to drastically reorganize its convection structure in response to the physiological processes under the influence of environmental cues."},{"title":"Hawkmoth flight stability in turbulent vortex streets","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4567","abstract":"Shedding of vortices is a common phenomenon in the atmosphere over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. However, it is unclear how these vortices of varying scales affect the flight performance of flying animals. In order to examine these interactions, we trained seven hawkmoths (Manduca sexta) (wingspan ~9 cm) to fly and feed in a wind tunnel under steady flow (controls) and in the von Kármán vortex street of vertically oriented cylinders (two different cylinders with diameters of 10 and 5 cm) at speeds of 0.5, 1 and 2 m s−1. Cylinders were placed at distances of 5, 25 and 100 cm upstream of the moths. Moths exhibited large amplitude yaw oscillations coupled with modest oscillations in roll and pitch, and slight increases in wingbeat frequency when flying in both the near (recirculating) and middle (vortex dominated) wake regions. Wingbeat amplitude did not vary among treatments, except at 1 m s−1 for the large cylinder. Yaw and roll oscillations were synchronized with the vortex shedding frequencies in moths flying in the wake of the large cylinder at all speeds. In contrast, yaw and pitch were synchronized with the shedding frequency of small vortices at speeds ≤1 m s−1. Oscillations in body orientation were also substantially smaller in the small cylinder treatment when compared with the large cylinder, regardless of temporal or non-dimensional spatial scale. Moths flying in steady conditions reached a higher air speed than those flying into cylinder wakes. In general, flight effects produced by the cylinder wakes were qualitatively similar among the recirculating and vortex-dominated wake regions; the magnitude of those effects, however, declined gradually with downstream distance."},{"title":"Proteomic response of marine invertebrate larvae to ocean acidification and hypoxia during metamorphosis and calcification","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4580","abstract":"Calcifying marine invertebrates with complex life cycles are particularly at risk to climate changes as they undergo an abrupt ontogenetic shift during larval metamorphosis. Although our understanding of the larval response to climate changes is rapidly advancing, the proteome plasticity involved in a compensatory response to climate change is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the proteomic response of metamorphosing larvae of the tubeworm Hydroides elegans, challenged with two climate change stressors, ocean acidification (OA; pH 7.6) and hypoxia (HYP; 2.8 mg O2 l−1), and with both combined. Using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)-based approach coupled with mass spectrometry, we found that climate change stressors did not affect metamorphosis except under OA, but altered the larval proteome and phosphorylation status. Metabolism and various stress and calcification-related proteins were downregulated in response to OA. In OA and HYP combined, HYP restored the expression of the calcification-related proteins to the control levels. We speculate that mild HYP stress could compensate for the negative effects of OA. This study also discusses the potential functions of selected proteins that might play important roles in larval acclimation and adaption to climate change."},{"title":"Structure, material characteristics and function of the upper respiratory tract of the pygmy sperm whale","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4639","abstract":"Cetaceans are neckless, so the trachea is very short. The upper respiratory tract is separate from the mouth and pharynx, and the dorsal blowhole connects, via the vestibular and nasopalatine cavities, directly to the larynx. Toothed cetaceans (Odontoceti) are capable of producing sounds at depth, either for locating prey or for communication. It has been suggested that during dives, air from the lungs and upper respiratory tract can be moved to the vestibular and nasal cavities to permit sound generation to continue when air volume within these cavities decreases as ambient pressure rises. The pygmy sperm whale, Kogia breviceps, is a deep diver (500–1000 m) that is known to produce hunting clicks. Our study of an immature female shows that the upper respiratory tract is highly asymmetrical: the trachea and bronchi are extremely compressible, whereas the larynx is much more rigid. Laryngeal and tracheal volumes were established. Calculations based on Boyle's Law imply that all air from the lungs and bronchi would be transferred to the larynx and trachea by a depth of 270 m and that the larynx itself could not accommodate all respiratory air mass at a depth of 1000 m. This suggests that no respiratory air would be available for vocalisation. However, the bronchi, trachea and part of the larynx have a thick vascular lining featuring large, thin-walled vessels. We propose that these vessels may become dilated during dives to reduce the volume of the upper respiratory tract, permitting forward transfer of air through the larynx."},{"title":"Interactions between hypoxia tolerance and food deprivation in Amazonian oscars, Astronotus ocellatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4590","abstract":"Oscars are often subjected to a combination of low levels of oxygen and fasting during nest-guarding on Amazonian floodplains. We questioned whether this anorexia would aggravate the osmo-respiratory compromise. We compared fed and fasted oscars (10–14 days) in both normoxia and hypoxia (10–20 Torr, 4 h). Routine oxygen consumption rates (ṀO2) were increased by 75% in fasted fish, reflecting behavioural differences, whereas fasting improved hypoxia resistance and critical oxygen tensions (Pcrit) lowered from 54 Torr in fed fish to 34 Torr when fasting. In fed fish, hypoxia reduced liver lipid stores by approximately 50% and total liver energy content by 30%. Fasted fish had a 50% lower hepatosomatic index, resulting in lower total liver protein, glycogen and lipid energy stores under normoxia. Compared with hypoxic fed fish, hypoxic fasted fish only showed reduced liver protein levels and even gained glycogen (+50%) on a per gram basis. This confirms the hypothesis that hypoxia-tolerant fish protect their glycogen stores as much as possible as a safeguard for more prolonged hypoxic events. In general, fasted fish showed lower hydroxyacylCoA dehydrogenase activities compared with fed fish, although this effect was only significant in hypoxic fasted fish. Energy stores and activities of enzymes related to energy metabolism in muscle or gills were not affected. Branchial Na+ uptake rates were more than two times lower in fed fish, whereas Na+ efflux was similar. Fed and fasted fish quickly reduced Na+ uptake and efflux during hypoxia, with fasting fish responding more rapidly. Ammonia excretion and K+ efflux were reduced under hypoxia, indicating decreased transcellular permeability. Fasted fish had more mitochondria-rich cells (MRC), with larger crypts, indicating the increased importance of the branchial uptake route when feeding is limited. Gill MRC density and surface area were greatly reduced under hypoxia, possibly to reduce ion uptake and efflux rates. Density of mucous cells of normoxic fasted fish was approximately fourfold of that in fed fish. Overall, a 10–14 day fasting period had no negative effects on hypoxia tolerance in oscars, as fasted fish were able to respond more quickly to lower oxygen levels, and reduced branchial permeability effectively."},{"title":"Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) brain cells respond to hyperosmotic challenge by inducing myo-inositol biosynthesis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4615","abstract":"This study aimed to determine the regulation of the de novo myo-inositol biosynthetic (MIB) pathway in Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) brain following acute (25 ppt) and chronic (30, 60 and 90 ppt) salinity acclimations. The MIB pathway plays an important role in accumulating the compatible osmolyte, myo-inositol, in cells in response to hyperosmotic challenge and consists of two enzymes, myo-inositol phosphate synthase and inositol monophosphatase. In tilapia brain, MIB enzyme transcriptional regulation was found to robustly increase in a time (acute acclimation) or dose (chronic acclimation) dependent manner. Blood plasma osmolality and Na+ and Cl− concentrations were also measured and significantly increased in response to both acute and chronic salinity challenges. Interestingly, highly significant positive correlations were found between MIB enzyme mRNA and blood plasma osmolality in both acute and chronic salinity acclimations. Additionally, a mass spectrometry assay was established and used to quantify total myo-inositol concentration in tilapia brain, which closely mirrored the hyperosmotic MIB pathway induction. Thus, myo-inositol is a major compatible osmolyte that is accumulated in brain cells when exposed to acute and chronic hyperosmotic challenge. These data show that the MIB pathway is highly induced in response to environmental salinity challenge in tilapia brain and that this induction is likely prompted by increases in blood plasma osmolality. Because the MIB pathway uses glucose-6-phosphate as a substrate and large amounts of myo-inositol are being synthesized, our data also illustrate that the MIB pathway likely contributes to the high energetic demand posed by salinity challenge."},{"title":"Salinity-induced regulation of the myo-inositol biosynthesis pathway in tilapia gill epithelium","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4626","abstract":"The myo-inositol biosynthesis (MIB) pathway converts glucose-6-phosphate to the compatible osmolyte myo-inositol that protects cells from osmotic stress. Using proteomics, the enzymes that constitute the MIB pathway, myo-inositol phosphate synthase (MIPS) and inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1), are identified in tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) gill epithelium. Targeted, quantitative, label-free proteomics reveals that they are both upregulated during salinity stress. Upregulation is stronger when fish are exposed to severe (34 ppt acute and 90 ppt gradual) relative to moderate (70 ppt gradual) salinity stress. IMPA1 always responds more strongly than MIPS, suggesting that MIPS is more stable during salinity stress. MIPS is N-terminally acetylated and the corresponding peptide increases proportionally to MIPS protein, while non-acetylated N-terminal peptide is not detectable, indicating that MIPS acetylation is constitutive and may serve to stabilize the protein. Hyperosmotic induction of MIPS and IMPA1 is confirmed using western blot and real-time qPCR and is much higher at the mRNA than at the protein level. Two distinct MIPS mRNA variants are expressed in the gill, but one is more strongly regulated by salinity than the other. A single MIPS gene is encoded in the tilapia genome whereas the zebrafish genome lacks MIPS entirely. The genome of euryhaline tilapia contains four IMPA genes, two of which are expressed, but only one is salinity regulated in gill epithelium. The genome of stenohaline zebrafish contains a single IMPA gene. We conclude that the MIB pathway represents a major salinity stress coping mechanism that is regulated at multiple levels in euryhaline fish but absent in stenohaline zebrafish."},{"title":"Prolonged food deprivation increases mRNA expression of deiodinase 1 and 2, and thyroid hormone receptor β-1 in a fasting-adapted mammal","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4647","abstract":"Food deprivation in mammals is typically associated with reduced thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations and deiodinase content and activity to suppress metabolism. However, in prolonged-fasted, metabolically active elephant seal pups, TH levels are maintained, if not elevated. The functional relevance of this apparent paradox is unknown and demonstrates variability in the regulation of TH levels, metabolism and function in food-deprived mammals. To address our hypothesis that cellular TH-mediated activity is upregulated with fasting duration, we quantified the mRNA expression and protein content of adipose and muscle deiodinase type I (DI1) and type II (DI2), and TH receptor beta-1 (THrβ-1) after 1, 3 and 7 weeks of fasting in northern elephant seal pups (N=5–7 per week). Fasting did not decrease the concentrations of plasma thyroid stimulating hormone, total triiodothyronine (tT3), free T3, total thyroxine (tT4) or free T4, suggesting that the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis is not suppressed, but rather maintained during fasting. Mean mRNA expression of adipose DI1 and DI2 increased threefold and fourfold, respectively, and 20- and 30-fold, respectively, in muscle. With the exception of adipose DI1, protein expression of adipose DI2 and muscle DI1 and DI2 increased twofold to fourfold. Fasting also increased adipose (fivefold) and muscle (fourfold) THrβ-1 mRNA expression, suggesting that the mechanisms mediating cellular TH activity are upregulated with prolonged fasting. The data demonstrate a unique, atypical mechanism of TH activity and regulation in mammals adapted to prolonged food deprivation in which the potential responsiveness of peripheral tissues and cellular TH activity are increased, which may contribute to their lipid-based metabolism."},{"title":"Maintaining acoustic communication at a cocktail party: heterospecific masking noise improves signal detection through frequency separation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4655","abstract":"We examined acoustic masking in a chirping katydid species of the Mecopoda elongata complex due to interference with a sympatric Mecopoda species where males produce continuous trills at high amplitudes. Frequency spectra of both calling songs range from 1 to 80 kHz; the chirper species has more energy in a narrow frequency band at 2 kHz and above 40 kHz. Behaviourally, chirper males successfully phase-locked their chirps to playbacks of conspecific chirps under masking conditions at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of −8 dB. After the 2 kHz band in the chirp had been equalised to the level in the masking trill, the breakdown of phase-locked synchrony occurred at a SNR of +7 dB. The remarkable receiver performance is partially mirrored in the selective response of a first-order auditory interneuron (TN1) to conspecific chirps under these masking conditions. However, the selective response is only maintained for a stimulus including the 2 kHz component, although this frequency band has no influence on the unmasked TN1 response. Remarkably, the addition of masking noise at 65 dB sound pressure level (SPL) to threshold response levels of TN1 for pure tones of 2 kHz enhanced the sensitivity of the response by 10 dB. Thus, the spectral dissimilarity between masker and signal at a rather low frequency appears to be of crucial importance for the ability of the chirping species to communicate under strong masking by the trilling species.

Previous kinematic studies of fish Kármán gaiting in a vortex street behind a cylinder only report time-averaged measurements, precluding our ability to formally describe motions on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Here we present the first analytical model that describes the swimming kinematics of Kármán gaiting trout with 70–90% accuracy. We found that body bending kinematics can be modelled with a travelling wave equation, which has also been shown to accurately model free-stream swimming kinematics. However, free-stream swimming and Kármán gaiting are separated in the parameter space; the amplitude, wavelength and frequency values of the traveling wave equation are substantially different for each behavior. During Kármán gaiting, the wave is initiated at the body center, which is 0.2L (where L is total body length) further down the body compared with the initiation point in free-stream swimming. The wave travels with a constant speed, which is higher than the nominal flow speed just as in free-stream swimming. In addition to undulation, we observed that Kármán gaiting fish also exhibit substantial lateral translations and body rotations, which can constitute up to 75% of the behavior. These motions are periodic and their frequencies also match the vortex shedding frequency. There is an inverse correlation between head angle and body angle: when the body rotates in one direction, the head of the fish turns into the opposite direction. Our kinematic model mathematically describes how fish swim in vortical flows in real time and provides a platform to better understand the effects of flow variations as well as the contribution of muscle activity during corrective motions."},{"title":"The behavioural effects of predator-induced stress responses in the cricket (Gryllus texensis): the upside of the stress response","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4608","abstract":"Predator-induced stress responses are thought to reduce an animal's risk of being eaten. Therefore, these stress responses should enhance anti-predator behaviour. We found that individual insects (the cricket Gryllus texensis) show reliable behavioural responses (i.e. behavioural types) in a plus-shaped maze. An individual's behaviour in the plus maze remained consistent for at least 1/2 of its adult life. However, after exposure to a model predator, both male and female crickets showed a reduced period of immobility and an increased amount of time spent under shelter compared with controls. These changes could be mimicked by injections of the insect stress neurohormone octopamine. These behavioural changes probably aid crickets in evading predators. Exposure to a model predator increased the ability of crickets to escape a live predator (a bearded dragon, Pogona vitticeps). An injection of octopamine had the same effect, showing that stress hormones can reduce predation. Using crickets to study the fitness consequences of predator-induced stress responses will help integrate ecological and biomedical concepts of ‘stress’."},{"title":"Stress-induced plastic responses in Drosophila simulans following exposure to combinations of temperature and humidity levels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4601","abstract":"Plastic responses to heat and desiccation stress in insects have been studied in many laboratory experiments on Drosophila. However, in these studies the possible interaction between the corresponding stress factors in natural environments has not been taken into consideration. We investigated changes in heat and desiccation resistance of adult Drosophila simulans after short-term exposures to different temperatures (35, 31 and 18°C) in combination with high and low relative humidity (ca. 90 and 20%, respectively). Hardening under extreme conditions (35 or 31°C and low relative humidity) commonly resulted in higher resistance to heat and desiccation as compared with other less stressful combinations of temperature and humidity levels. The concentration of the heat-shock protein Hsp70 in the experimental flies increased following almost all applied treatments. Life span of the hardened flies under non-stressful conditions was reduced irrespective of the stress dose, indicating a fitness cost for the plastic responses. The results of the study show that hardening using combined heat and desiccation stress can be very efficient with regard to induction of plastic responses improving tolerance to both types of stress. This may favour adaptation to hot and dry climatic conditions, though the negative effects on fitness are likely to constrain evolution of such plastic responses."},{"title":"Increase in cardiac myosin heavy-chain (MyHC) alpha protein isoform in hibernating ground squirrels, with echocardiographic visualization of ventricular wall hypertrophy and prolonged contraction","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4678","abstract":"Deep hibernators such as golden-mantled ground squirrels (Callospermophilus lateralis) have multiple challenges to cardiac function during low temperature torpor and subsequent arousals. As heart rates fall from over 300 beats min−1 to less than 10, chamber dilation and reduced cardiac output could lead to congestive myopathy. We performed echocardiography on a cohort of individuals prior to and after several months of hibernation. The left ventricular chamber exhibited eccentric and concentric hypertrophy during hibernation and thus calculated ventricular mass was ~30% greater. Ventricular ejection fraction was mildly reduced during hibernation but stroke volumes were greater due to the eccentric hypertrophy and dramatically increased diastolic filling volumes. Globally, the systolic phase in hibernation was ~9.5 times longer, and the diastolic phase was 28× longer. Left atrial ejection generally was not observed during hibernation. Atrial ejection returned weakly during early arousal. Strain echocardiography assessed the velocity and total movement distance of contraction and relaxation for regional ventricular segments in active and early arousal states. Myocardial systolic strain during early arousal was significantly greater than the active state, indicating greater total contractile movement. This mirrored the increased ventricular ejection fraction noted with early arousal. However, strain rates were slower during early arousal than during the active period, particularly systolic strain, which was 33% of active, compared with the rate of diastolic strain, which was 67% of active. As heart rate rose during the arousal period, myocardial velocities and strain rates also increased; this was matched closely by cardiac output. Curiously, though heart rates were only 26% of active heart rates during early arousal, the cardiac output was nearly 40% of the active state, suggesting an efficient pumping system. We further analyzed proportions of cardiac myosin heavy-chain (MyHC) isoforms in a separate cohort of squirrels over 5 months, including time points before hibernation, during hibernation and just prior to emergence. Hibernating individuals were maintained in both a 4°C cold room and a 20°C warm room. Measured by SDS-PAGE, relative percentages of cardiac MyHC alpha were increased during hibernation, at both hibernacula temperatures. A potential increase in contractile speed, and power, from more abundant MyHC alpha may aid force generation at low temperature and at low heart rates. Unlike many models of cardiomyopathies where the alpha isoform is replaced by the beta isoform in order to reduce oxygen consumption, ground squirrels demonstrate a potential cardioprotective mechanism to maintain cardiac output during torpor."},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake.

Effect of exposing the mother, but not her pups, to a cold environment during lactation in mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4326","abstract":"The capacity of females to dissipate heat may constrain sustained energy intake during lactation. However, some previous experiments supporting this concept have confounded the impact of temperature on the mothers with the impact on the pups. We aimed to separate these effects in lactating laboratory mice (MF1 strain) by giving the mothers access to cages at two ambient temperatures (10 and 21°C) joined by a tube. Food was available only in the cold cage, but females could also choose go to this cage to cool down while their pups were housed in the warmer cage. Control animals had access to the same configuration of cages but with both maintained at 21°C. We hypothesised that if females were limited by heat dissipation, alleviating the heat load by providing a cool environment would allow them to dissipate more heat, take in more food, generate more milk and hence wean heavier litters. We measured maternal energy budgets and monitored time courses of core body temperature and physical activity. To minimise the variance in energy budgets, all litters were adjusted to 12 (±1) pups. Females in the experimental group had higher energy intake (F1,14=15.8, P=0.0014) and higher assimilated energy (F1,13=10.7, P=0.006), and provided their pups with more milk (F1,13=6.65, P=0.03), consistent with the heat dissipation limit theory. Yet, despite keeping demand constant, mean pup growth rates were similar (F1,13=0.06, P=0.8); thus, our data emphasise the difficulties of inferring milk production indirectly from pup growth."},{"title":"Insights into differential activity patterns of drosophilids under semi-natural conditions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4691","abstract":"We showed recently that Drosophila ananassae, a closely related and sympatric species of the commonly studied fruitfly D. melanogaster, shows distinctly deviant patterns in circadian activity/rest rhythm from the latter under a variety of laboratory conditions. To examine whether such differences extend to more natural conditions where a variety of time cues and similar environmental pressures might force different species to adopt similar temporal patterns, we examined these two species under semi-natural conditions over a span of 1.5 years. Furthermore, we asked to what extent features of activity/rest rhythm of flies are conserved across species under changing environmental conditions encountered across seasons, and to do so, we studied two more drosophilid species. We found that while each species exhibits seasonality in activity patterns, this seasonality is marked by interesting inter-specific differences. Similar to laboratory studies, D. ananassae showed activity mostly during the day, while D. melanogaster and D. malerkotliana exhibited almost similar activity patterns across seasons, with predominantly two peaks of activity, one in the morning and another in the evening. Throughout the year, Zaprionus indianus displayed very low levels of activity compared with D. melanogaster, yet, compared with those seen in standard laboratory assays, this species exhibited more robust rhythms under semi-natural conditions. We hypothesise that different ecological factors may have influenced these species to adopt different temporal niches."},{"title":"Mass and volume growth of an insect tracheal system within a single instar","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/24/4703","abstract":"Organisms must accommodate oxygen delivery to developing tissues as body mass increases during growth. In insects, the growth of the respiratory system has been assumed to occur only during molts, whereas body mass and volume increase during the larval stages between molts. This decouples whole-body growth from the growth of the oxygen supply system. This assumption is derived from the observation that the insect respiratory system is an invagination of the exoskeleton, which must be shed during molts for continued growth to occur. Here, we provide evidence that this assumption is incorrect. We found that the respiratory system increases substantially in both mass and volume within the last larval instar of Manduca sexta larvae, and that the growth of the respiratory system changes with diet quality, potentially as a consequence of shifting metabolic demands."},{"title":"The role of reduced oxygen in the developmental physiology of growth and metamorphosis initiation in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4334","abstract":"Rearing oxygen level is known to affect final body size in a variety of insects, but the physiological mechanisms by which oxygen affects size are incompletely understood. In Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster, the larval size at which metamorphosis is initiated largely determines adult size, and metamorphosis is initiated when larvae attain a critical mass. We hypothesized that oxygen effects on final size might be mediated by oxygen effects on the critical weight and the ecdysone titers, which regulate growth rate and the timing of developmental transitions. Our results showed that oxygen affected critical weight, the basal ecdysone titers and the timing of the ecdysone peak, providing clear evidence that oxygen affected growth rate and developmental rate. Hypoxic third instar larvae (10% oxygen) exhibited a reduced critical weight, slower growth rate, delayed pupariation, elevated baseline ecdysone levels and a delayed ecdysone peak that occurred at a lower larval mass. Hyperoxic larvae exhibited increased basal ecdysone levels, but no change in critical weight compared with normoxic larvae and no significant change in timing of pupariation. Previous studies have shown that nutrition is crucial for regulating growth rate and the timing of developmental transitions. Here we show that oxygen level is one of multiple cues that together regulate adult size and the timing and dynamics of growth, developmental rate and ecdysone signaling."},{"title":"Light from down under","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4341","abstract":"Coral–algae symbiosis is a key feature of tropical corals and is highly dependent on the efficiency with which solar energy is attenuated by the coral. Scleractinian corals are among the most efficient light collectors in nature because of the modulation of the internal light field in the coral skeleton. Interestingly, coral skeleton particles composing the sandy bottoms in reef margins sustain these optical characteristics. In the present study, we examined two free-living coral species – Heterocyathus aequicostatus (Caryophyllidae) and Heteropsammia cochlea (Dendrophylliidae) – common on biogenic coarse carbonate sand of the Great Barrier Reef but absent from fine sand at the same depth. In coarse carbonate sand, light penetrates a few millimeters below the surface and propagates along horizontal distances of a few centimeters. In fine sand, almost all of the light is reflected back to the water column. For photosynthetic sand-dwelling organisms such as the studied species, with over one-third of their surface area facing the substrate, light flux to their underside may be beneficial. A correlation was found between the diameter of these corals and the distance that light may travel in the sand under the coral. Laboratory and field measurements show that the symbiotic algae on the underside of the corallites are photosynthetically active even when the coral is partially buried, implying sufficient light penetration. Other organisms in the study site, such as fungid corals and foraminiferans, with different morphologies, have different light-trapping strategies but are also photosynthesizing on their underside. The importance of the substrate type to the performance of the three main partners of the symbiosis (coral, endosymbiotic algae and a sipunculan worm) is highlighted, and is a striking example of co-evolution."},{"title":"Insulin-like peptides (AmILP1 and AmILP2) differentially affect female caste development in the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4347","abstract":"The food a honey bee female larva receives determines whether she develops into a large long-lived fertile queen or a short-lived sterile worker. Through well-established nutrient-sensing and growth-promoting functions in metazoans, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling (IIS) pathway has become a focal topic in investigations on how differences in food environment can be translated into internal signals responsible for queen–worker determination. However, low expression levels of two insulin receptors (AmInRs) in honey bee larvae and the failure of one AmInR to influence caste differentiation are in potential conflict with such a classical growth-promoting role of IIS in queen–worker development. In view of such an apparent contradiction, and the fact that binding partners and affinities of these two AmInRs have not been worked out, we performed a functional study on insulin-like peptide genes (AmILP1 and AmILP2) in honey bee larvae by using a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated gene knockdown approach. We found that juvenile hormone (JH) levels were diminished by AmILP1 dsRNA treatment, while the AmILP2 knockdown caused a reduction in ovary size. Blood sugar titers were not significantly affected by the treatments. From these results we conclude that AmILP2 transcript levels may influence specific organ development, such as the ovary and body mass, while more general traits of caste differentiation, such as mandibles, may require additional regulators. In addition, JH production may be regulated by AmILP1 expressed locally in the brain, similar to the function of certain ILPs in Drosophila."},{"title":"Spectral tuning of Amazon parrot feather coloration by psittacofulvin pigments and spongy structures","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4358","abstract":"The feathers of Amazon parrots are brightly coloured. They contain a unique class of pigments, the psittacofulvins, deposited in both barbs and barbules, causing yellow or red coloured feathers. In specific feather areas, spongy nanostructured barb cells exist, reflecting either in the blue or blue-green wavelength range. The blue-green spongy structures are partly enveloped by a blue-absorbing, yellow-colouring pigment acting as a spectral filter, thus yielding a green coloured barb. Applying reflection and transmission spectroscopy, we characterized the Amazons' pigments and spongy structures, and investigated how they contribute to the feather coloration. The reflectance spectra of Amazon feathers are presumably tuned to the sensitivity spectra of the visual photoreceptors."},{"title":"Effects of running on human Achilles tendon length–tension properties in the free and gastrocnemius components","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4388","abstract":"The elastic properties of the human Achilles tendon are important for locomotion; however, in vitro tests suggest that repeated cyclic contractions lead to tendon fatigue – an increase in length in response to stress applied. In vivo experiments have not, however, demonstrated mechanical fatigue in the Achilles tendon, possibly due to the limitations of using two-dimensional ultrasound imaging to assess tendon strain. This study used freehand three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) to determine whether the free Achilles tendon (calcaneus to soleus) or the gastrocnemius tendon (calcaneus to gastrocnemius) demonstrated tendon fatigue after running exercise. Participants (N=9) underwent 3DUS scans of the Achilles tendon during isometric contractions at four ankle torque levels (passive, and 14, 42 and 70 N m) before and after a 5 km run at a self-selected pace (10–14 km h−1). Running had a significant main effect on the length of the free Achilles tendon (P<0.01) with a small increase in length across the torque range. However, the mean lengthening effect was small (<1%) and was not accompanied by a change in free tendon stiffness. There was no significant change in the length of the gastrocnemius tendon or the free tendon cross-sectional area. While the free tendon was shown to lengthen, the lack of change in stiffness suggests the tendon exhibited mechanical creep rather than fatigue. These effects were much smaller than those predicted from in vitro experiments, possibly due to the different loading profile encountered and the ability of the tendon to repair in vivo."},{"title":"Autotrophic and heterotrophic responses of the coral Porites lutea to large amplitude internal waves","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4365","abstract":"Large amplitude internal waves (LAIW) cause frequent and severe changes in the physico-chemical environment of Andaman Sea coral reefs and are a potentially important source of disturbance for corals. To explore the coral response to LAIW, prey capture disposition and photosynthesis were investigated in relation to changes in seawater temperature, pH, flow speed and food availability in LAIW simulation studies under controlled laboratory conditions, using Porites lutea as a model organism. Although food presence stimulated polyp expansion, we found an overriding effect of low temperature (19°C) causing retraction of the coral polyps into their calices, particularly when pH was altered concomitantly. Decreases in pH alone, however, caused the expansion of the polyps. The exposure history of the colonies played a crucial role in coral responses: prior field exposure to LAIW yielded lower retraction levels than in LAIW-inexperienced corals, suggesting acclimatization. Low temperature (19°C) exposure did not seem to influence the photosynthetic performance, but LAIW-experienced corals showed higher values of maximum dark-adapted quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of photosystem II than LAIW-inexperienced controls. Collectively, these data suggest that P. lutea, the dominant hermatypic coral in the Andaman Sea, can acclimatize to extreme changes in its abiotic environment by modulating its mixotrophic nutrition, through polyp expansion and potential feeding, as well as its photosynthetic efficiency."},{"title":"Anoxia-mediated calcium release through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore silences NMDA receptor currents in turtle neurons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4375","abstract":"Mammalian neurons are anoxia sensitive and rapidly undergo excitotoxic cell death when deprived of oxygen, mediated largely by Ca2+ entry through over-activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). This does not occur in neurons of the anoxia-tolerant western painted turtle, where a decrease in NMDAR currents is observed with anoxia. This decrease is dependent on a modest rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c) that is mediated by release from the mitochondria. The aim of this study was to determine whether the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is involved in NMDAR silencing through release of mitochondrial Ca2+. Opening the mPTP during normoxia with atractyloside decreased NMDAR currents by releasing mitochondrial Ca2+, indicated by an increase in Oregon Green fluorescence. Conversely, the mPTP blocker cyclosporin A prevented the anoxia-mediated increase in [Ca2+]c and reduction in NMDAR currents. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm) was determined using rhodamine-123 fluorescence and decreased with the onset of anoxia in a time frame that coincided with the increase in [Ca2+]c. Activation of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (mK+ATP) channels also releases mitochondrial Ca2+ and we show that activation of mK+ATP channels during normoxia with diazoxide leads to Ψm depolarization and inhibition with 5-hydroxydecanoic acid blocked anoxia-mediated Ψm depolarization. Ψm does not collapse during anoxia but rather reaches a new steady-state level that is maintained via ATP hydrolysis by the F1-F0 ATPase, as inhibition with oligomycin depolarizes Ψm further than the anoxic level. We conclude that anoxia activates mK+ATP channels, which leads to matrix depolarization, Ca2+ release via the mPTP, and ultimately silencing of NMDARs."},{"title":"Eclosion gates progression of the adult ecdysis sequence of Drosophila","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4395","abstract":"Animal behavior is often organized into stereotyped sequences that promote the goals of reproduction, development and survival. However, for most behaviors, the neural mechanisms that govern the order of execution of the motor programs within a sequence are poorly understood. An important model in understanding the hormonal determinants of behavioral sequencing is the ecdysis sequence, which is performed by insects at each developmental transition, or molt. The adult ecdysis sequence in Drosophila includes the emergence of the insect from the pupal case followed by expansion and hardening of the wings. Wing expansion is governed by the hormone bursicon, and stimulation of the bursicon-expressing neurons in newly eclosed flies induces rapid wing expansion. Here we show that that such stimulation delivered prior to eclosion has no immediate effect, but does cause rapid wing expansion after eclosion if the stimulus is delivered within 40 min of that event. We observe a similar delayed effect upon stimulation of a single pair of bursicon-expressing neurons previously identified as command neurons for wing expansion. We conclude that command neuron stimulation enables the motor output pathway for wing expansion, but that this pathway is blocked prior to eclosion. By manipulating the time of eclosion, we demonstrate that some physiological process tightly coupled to adult ecdysis releases the block on wing expansion. Eclosion thus serves as a behavioral checkpoint and complements hormonal mechanisms to ensure that wing expansion strictly follows eclosion in the ecdysis sequence."},{"title":"Exclusive localization of carbonic anhydrase in bacteriocytes of the deep-sea clam Calyptogena okutanii with thioautotrophic symbiotic bacteria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4403","abstract":"Deep-sea Calyptogena clams harbor thioautotrophic intracellular symbiotic bacteria in their gill epithelial cells. The symbiont fixes CO2 to synthesize organic compounds. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) from the host catalyzes the reaction CO2 + H2O ↔ HCO3− + H+, and is assumed to facilitate inorganic carbon (Ci) uptake and transport to the symbiont. However, the localization of CA in gill tissue remains unknown. We therefore analyzed mRNA sequences, proteins and CA activity in Calyptogena okutanii using expression sequence tag, SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS. We found that acetazolamide-sensitive soluble CA was abundantly expressed in the gill tissue of C. okutanii, and the enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the CA of C. okutanii were used in western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining of the gill tissues of C. okutanii, which showed that CA was exclusively localized in the symbiont-harboring cells (bacteriocytes) in gill epithelial cells. Western blot analysis and measurement of activity showed that CA was abundantly (26–72% of total soluble protein) detected in the gill tissues of not only Calyptogena clams but also deep-sea Bathymodiolus mussels that harbor thioautotrophic or methanotrophic symbiotic bacteria, but was not detected in a non-symbiotic mussel, Mytilus sp. The present study showed that CA is abundant in the gill tissues of deep-sea symbiotic bivalves and specifically localizes in the cytoplasm of bacteriocytes of C. okutanii. This indicates that the Ci supply process to symbionts in the vacuole (symbiosome) in bacteriocytes is essential for symbiosis."},{"title":"Masters of change: seasonal plasticity in the prey-capture behavior of the Alpine newt Ichthyosaura alpestris (Salamandridae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4426","abstract":"Transitions between aquatic and terrestrial environments are significant steps in vertebrate evolution. These transitions require major changes in many biological functions, including food uptake and transport. The Alpine newt, Ichthyosaura alpestris, is known to show a ‘multiphasic lifestyle’ where the adult shifts from a terrestrial to an aquatic lifestyle and then back to a terrestrial lifestyle every year as a result of its breeding activity. These transitions correspond to dramatic changes in morphology, physiology and behavior, resulting in distinct aquatic and terrestrial morphotypes. We hypothesized that these shifts go along with changes in prey-capture mechanics to maintain a sufficiently high performance in both environments. We analyzed the prey-capture kinematics in the four possible modes: aquatic strikes in the aquatic phase, terrestrial strikes in the terrestrial phase, aquatic strikes in the terrestrial phase and terrestrial strikes in the aquatic phase. A multivariate comparison detected significant kinematic differences between the phase-specific feeding modes. In both the aquatic and the terrestrial phase, I. alpestris uses a suction-feeding mechanism for capturing prey in water. By contrast, I. alpestris uses a jaw-based grasping mechanism with a kinematic profile similar to the aquatic modes for terrestrial prey-capture in its aquatic phase but an elaborate lingual-based prehension mechanism to capture terrestrial prey in the terrestrial phase. These results exhibit a so-far unknown amount of behavioral plasticity in prey-capture behavior that is tuned to the seasonal demands of performance, and exemplify functional mechanisms behind aquatic–terrestrial transitions in vertebrates."},{"title":"The response of brain serotonergic and dopaminergic systems to an acute stressor in rainbow trout: a time course study","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4435","abstract":"The brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems are known to be involved in the integrated response to stress in vertebrates. However, present knowledge about the timing of their actions as well as their specific roles in the regulation of the endocrine axes that drive the stress response is incomplete. This is partly because of the complexity of the reciprocal interactions among the monoaminergic systems and other biochemical effectors of the stress response such as corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), arginine vasotocin (AVT), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosteroids. In this study, we show for the first time in teleost fish (rainbow trout) the short- and mid-term time course of the response of the forebrain serotonergic and dopaminergic activities after exposure to an acute stressor. Other stress markers like the plasma levels of cortisol, glucose and lactate were also monitored, providing a context in which to precisely locate the monoaminergic activation within the fish acute stress response. Our results show that acute stress induced a rapid increase in forebrain serotonergic activity, which became elevated after only 15 s of chasing. Several hours after stress, serotonergic activity recovered its basal levels, in parallel with the recovery of other stress markers such as plasma catecholamines and cortisol. Dopaminergic activity was also increased after stress, but only in the telencephalon and only after 20 min. The increase in serotonergic activity happened before the elevation of plasma catecholamines, suggesting that this monoamine system could have a key role in triggering the initial steps of the activation of not only the hypothalamus–pituitary–inter-renal axis but also the brain–sympathetic–chromaffin axis in fish."},{"title":"How parrots see their colours: novelty in the visual pigments of Platycercus elegans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4454","abstract":"Intraspecific differences in retinal physiology have been demonstrated in several vertebrate taxa and are often subject to adaptive evolution. Nonetheless, such differences are currently unknown in birds, despite variations in habitat, behaviour and visual stimuli that might influence spectral sensitivity. The parrot Platycercus elegans is a species complex with extreme plumage colour differences between (and sometimes within) subspecies, making it an ideal candidate for intraspecific differences in spectral sensitivity. Here, the visual pigments of P. elegans were fully characterised through molecular sequencing of five visual opsin genes and measurement of their absorbance spectra using microspectrophotometry. Three of the genes, LWS, SW1 and SWS2, encode for proteins similar to those found in other birds; however, both the RH1 and RH2 pigments had polypeptides with carboxyl termini of different lengths and unusual properties that are unknown previously for any vertebrate visual pigment. Specifically, multiple RH2 transcripts and protein variants (short, medium and long) were identified for the first time that are generated by alternative splicing of downstream coding and non-coding exons. Our work provides the first complete characterisation of the visual pigments of a parrot, perhaps the most colourful order of birds, and moreover suggests more variability in avian eyes than hitherto considered."},{"title":"Visual stimulus characteristics that elicit tracking and striking in the praying mantises Parasphendale affinis, Popa spurca and Sphodromantis lineola","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4443","abstract":"We tested three species of praying mantis, Parasphendale affinis, Popa spurca and Sphodromantis lineola, with computer-generated stimuli that differed in size, contrast, configuration and movement pattern to determine the effects of these parameters on visual tracking and striking behavior. Overall, black disks moving erratically against a white background were strong releasers of both behaviors. When stimulus presentation order was randomized by size, P. affinis and P. spurca struck at progressively higher rates as the stimuli enlarged up to 44 deg; S. lineola struck most at intermediate sized (10–20 deg) disks. When disks were size-ordered from small to large, P. affinis and S. lineola struck at the smaller disks at higher rates; however, when the order was reversed, the early appearance of large disks suppressed subsequent responses to the smaller disks. Stimulus order did not differentially affect the responses of P. spurca. All species responded at higher rates to black disks moving against a white background versus the reverse. However, only P. spurca and S. lineola responded at higher rates to relatively darker grey disks, only P. affinis responded to mottled grey disks moving against an identically patterned background, and only P. spurca struck more frequently in response to rectangular stimuli oriented parallel (versus orthogonal) to their direction of movement. In conjunction with data on other species, these results support the hypothesis that praying mantises recognize prey based on assessment of several category-specific, spatiotemporal features, e.g. size, contrast, speed, movement pattern and leading edge length."},{"title":"Phylogeny and effects of anoxia on hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel gene expression in the heart of a primitive chordate, the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4462","abstract":"The aneural heart of the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, varies heart rate fourfold during recovery from anoxia. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which play an important role in establishing the pacemaker rate of vertebrate hearts, were postulated to be present in this ancestral vertebrate heart, and it was also theorized that changes in hagfish heart rate with oxygen availability involved altered HCN expression. Partial gene cloning revealed six HCN isoforms in the hagfish heart. Hagfish representatives of HCN2, HCN3 and HCN4 were discovered, with HCN2 and HCN3 existing as isoforms designated as HCN2a, HCN2b, HCN3a, two paralogs of HCN3b, and HCN3c. Phylogenetic analysis revealed HCN3b and HCN3c to be ancestral, followed by HCN3a, HCN4 and HCN2. Moreover, HCN3a expression was dominant in both the atrial and ventricular chambers, suggesting that the HCN4 dominance in adult mammalian hearts appeared after hagfish divergence. HCN expression was higher in the atrium than in the ventricle, as might be expected given that atrial beating rate is known to be faster than the ventricular rate. In addition, mRNA expression under normoxic conditions was compared with that following 24 h of anoxia, and either a 2-h or 36-h recovery in normoxic water. In the ventricle, anoxia decreased HCN3a but not HCN4 expression. In contrast, atrial HCN3a expression significantly increased following 2 h of recovery, before returning to control levels following 36 h of recovery, possibly contributing to heart rate changes previously observed under these conditions."},{"title":"Coordinated ventilation and spiracle activity produce unidirectional airflow in the hissing cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4473","abstract":"Insects exchange respiratory gases via an extensive network of tracheal vessels that open to the surface of the body through spiracular valves. Although gas exchange is known to increase with the opening of these spiracles, it is not clear how this event relates to gas flow through the tracheal system. We examined the relationship between respiratory airflow and spiracle activity in a ventilating insect, the hissing cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa, to better understand the complexity of insect respiratory function. Using simultaneous video recordings of multiple spiracular valves, we found that abdominal spiracles open and close in unison during periods of ventilation. Additionally, independent recordings of CO2 release from the abdominal and thoracic regions and observations of hyperoxic tracer gas movement indicate that air is drawn into the thoracic spiracles and expelled from the abdominal spiracles. Our video recordings suggest that this unidirectional flow is driven by abdominal contractions that occur when the abdominal spiracles open. The spiracles then close as the abdomen relaxes and fills with air from the thorax. Therefore, the respiratory system of the hissing cockroach functions as a unidirectional pump through the coordinated action of the spiracles and abdominal musculature. This mechanism may be employed by a broad diversity of large insects that respire by active ventilation."},{"title":"Post-prandial regulation of hepatic glucokinase and lipogenesis requires the activation of TORC1 signalling in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4483","abstract":"To assess the potential involvement of TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex 1) signalling in the regulation of post-prandial hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism-related gene expression in trout, we employed intraperitoneal administration of rapamycin to achieve an acute inhibition of the TOR pathway. Our results reveal that rapamycin inhibits the phosphorylation of TORC1 and its downstream effectors (S6K1, S6 and 4E-BP1), without affecting Akt and the Akt substrates Forkhead-box Class O1 (FoxO1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β (GSK 3α/β). These results indicate that acute administration of rapamycin in trout leads to the inhibition of TORC1 activation. No effect is observed on the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, but hepatic TORC1 inhibition results in decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) gene expression and suppressed fatty acid synthase (FAS) and glucokinase (GK) at gene expression and activity levels, indicating that FAS and GK activity is controlled at a transcriptional level in a TORC1-dependent manner. This study demonstrates for the first time in fish that post-prandial regulation of hepatic lipogenesis and glucokinase in rainbow trout requires the activation of TORC1 signalling."},{"title":"Hypoxia delays hematopoiesis: retention of embryonic hemoglobin and erythrocytes in larval rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, during chronic hypoxia exposure","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/23/4415","abstract":"In rainbow trout development, a switch occurs from high-affinity embryonic hemoglobin (Hb) and round, embryonic erythrocytes to lower-affinity adult Hb and oval, adult erythrocytes. Our study investigated the early ontogeny of rainbow trout blood properties and the hypoxia response. We hypothesized that hypoxia exposure would delay the ontogenetic turnover of Hb and erythrocytes because retention of high-affinity embryonic Hb would facilitate oxygen loading. To test this hypothesis we developed a method of efficiently extracting blood from individual embryos and larvae and optimized several techniques for measuring hematological parameters on microliter (0.5–2.0 μl) blood samples. In chronic hypoxia (30% of oxygen saturation), stage-matched embryos and larvae possessed half the Hb concentration, erythrocyte counts and hematocrit observed in normoxia. Hypoxia-reared larvae also had threefold to sixfold higher mRNA expression of the embryonic Hb α-1, β-1 and β-2 subunits relative to stage-matched normoxia-reared larvae. Furthermore, in hypoxia, the round embryonic erythrocytic shape persisted into later developmental stages. Despite these differences, Hb–oxygen affinity (P50), cooperativity and the Root effect were unaltered in hypoxia-reared O. mykiss. The data support our hypothesis that chronic hypoxia delays the ontogenetic turnover of Hb and erythrocytes, but without the predicted functional consequences (i.e. higher than expected P50). These results also suggest that the Hb–oxygen affinity is protected during development in chronic hypoxia to favor oxygen unloading at the tissues. We conclude that in early trout development, the blood–oxygen transport system responds very differently to chronic hypoxia relative to adults, possibly because respiration depends relatively more on oxygen diffusion than convection."},{"title":"Mechanical properties of sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus) vertebrae in relation to spinal deformity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4256","abstract":"Approximately 35% of sand tiger sharks (Carcharias taurus) in public aquaria exhibit spinal deformities ranging from compressed vertebrae and loss of intervertebral space to dislocated spines with vertebral degeneration and massive spondylosis caused by excessive mineralization both within vertebrae and outside the notochordal sheath. To identify the mechanical basis of these deformities, vertebral centra from affected (N=12) and non-affected (N=9) C. taurus were subjected to axial compression tests on an MTS 858 Bionix material testing system, after which mineral content was determined. Vertebral centra from affected sharks had significantly lower mineral content and material behavior in nearly all variables characterizing elasticity, plasticity and failure. These mechanical deficiencies are correlated with size at capture, capture method, vitamin C and zinc deficiency, aquarium size and swimming behavior in public aquaria. Non-affected C. taurus had greater stiffness and toughness even though these properties are generally incompatible in mineralized structures, suggesting that the biphasic (mineralized, unmineralized phases) nature of chondrichthyan vertebrae yields material behavior not otherwise observed in vertebrate skeletons. However, vertebral centra from non-affected sharks had lower mineral content (33%), stiffness (167 MPa), yield strain (14%) and ultimate strength (16 MPa) than other species of sharks and bony vertebrates, indicating that biomechanical precautions must be taken in the husbandry of this species."},{"title":"Hemoglobin function and allosteric regulation in semi-fossorial rodents (family Sciuridae) with different altitudinal ranges","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4264","abstract":"Semi-fossorial ground squirrels face challenges to respiratory gas transport associated with the chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia of underground burrows, and such challenges are compounded in species that are native to high altitude. During hibernation, such species must also contend with vicissitudes of blood gas concentrations and plasma pH caused by episodic breathing. Here, we report an analysis of hemoglobin (Hb) function in six species of marmotine ground squirrels with different altitudinal distributions. Regardless of their native altitude, all species have high Hb–O2 affinities, mainly due to suppressed sensitivities to allosteric effectors [2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) and chloride ions]. This suppressed anion sensitivity is surprising given that all canonical anion-binding sites are conserved. Two sciurid species, the golden-mantled and thirteen-lined ground squirrel, have Hb–O2 affinities that are characterized by high pH sensitivity and low thermal sensitivity relative to the Hbs of humans and other mammals. The pronounced Bohr effect is surprising in light of highly unusual amino acid substitutions at the C-termini that are known to abolish the Bohr effect in human HbA. Taken together, the high O2 affinity of sciurid Hbs suggests an enhanced capacity for pulmonary O2 loading under hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions, while the large Bohr effect should help to ensure efficient O2 unloading in tissue capillaries. In spite of the relatively low thermal sensitivities of the sciurid Hbs, our results indicate that the effect of hypothermia on Hb oxygenation is the main factor contributing to the increased blood–O2 affinity in hibernating ground squirrels."},{"title":"Closed-loop stabilization of the Jamming Avoidance Response reveals its locally unstable and globally nonlinear dynamics","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4272","abstract":"The Jamming Avoidance Response, or JAR, in the weakly electric fish has been analyzed at all levels of organization, from whole-organism behavior down to specific ion channels.

We overcame the instability of the JAR in Eigenmannia virescens by closing a feedback loop around the behavioral response of the animal. Specifically, the instantaneous frequency of a jamming stimulus was tied to the fish's own electrogenic frequency by a feedback law. Without feedback, the fish's own frequency diverges from the stimulus frequency, but appropriate feedback stabilizes the behavior. After stabilizing the system, we measured the responses in the fish's instantaneous frequency to various stimuli. A delayed first-order linear system model fitted the behavior near the equilibrium. Coherence to white noise stimuli together with quantitative agreement across stimulus types supported this local linear model. Next, we examined the intrinsic nonlinearity of the behavior using clamped frequency difference experiments to extend the model beyond the neighborhood of the equilibrium. The resulting nonlinear model is composed of competing motor return and sensory escape terms. The model reproduces responses to step and ramp changes in the difference frequency (df) and predicts a ‘snap-through’ bifurcation as a function of dF that we confirmed experimentally."},{"title":"Physiological control of bioluminescence in a deep-sea planktonic worm, Tomopteris helgolandica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4285","abstract":"Tomopteris helgolandica Greeff 1879 (Tomopteridae) is a transparent holoplanktonic polychaete that can emit a bright light. In this study, we investigated the emission pattern and control of this deep-sea worm's luminescence. Potassium chloride depolarisation applied on anaesthetised specimens triggered a maximal yellow light emission from specific parapodial sites, suggesting that a nervous control pathway was involved. Pharmacological screening revealed a sensitivity to carbachol, which was confirmed by a dose–light response associated with a change in the light emission pattern, where physiological carbachol concentrations induced flashes and higher concentrations induced glows. The light response induced by its hydrolysable agonist, acetylcholine, was significantly weaker but was facilitated by eserine pretreatment. In addition, a specific inhibitory effect of tubocurarine was observed on carbachol-induced emission. Lastly, KCl- and carbachol-induced light responses were significantly reduced when preparations were pre-incubated in Ca2+-free artificial seawater or in different calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) and calmodulin inhibitor (trifluoperazine) solutions. All of these results strongly suggest that T. helgolandica produces its light flashes via activation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors and a calcium-dependent intracellular mechanism involving L-type calcium channels."},{"title":"Trade-off between camouflage and sexual dimorphism revealed by UV digital imaging: the case of Australian Mallee dragons (Ctenophorus fordi)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4290","abstract":"Colour patterns displayed by animals may result from the balance of the opposing requirements of sexual selection through display and natural selection through camouflage. Currently, little is known about the possibility of the dual purpose of an animal colour pattern in the UV region of the spectrum, which is potentially perceivable by both predators and conspecifics for detection or communication purposes. Here, we implemented linearised digital UV photography to characterise and quantify the colour pattern of an endemic Australian Agamid lizard classically regarded as monomorphic when considering data from the visible region of the spectrum. Our results indicate a widespread presence of UV elements across the entire body of the lizards and these patterns vary significantly in intensity, size and frequency between sexes. These results were modelled considering either lizard or avian visual characteristics, revealing that UV reflectance represents a trade-off between the requirements of sexual displaying to conspecifics and concealment from avian predators."},{"title":"Rolling with the flow: bumblebees flying in unsteady wakes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4299","abstract":"Our understanding of how variable wind in natural environments affects flying insects is limited because most studies of insect flight are conducted in either smooth flow or still air conditions. Here, we investigate the effects of structured, unsteady flow (the von Karman vortex street behind a cylinder) on the flight performance of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens). Bumblebees are ‘all-weather’ foragers and thus frequently experience variable aerial conditions, ranging from fully mixed, turbulent flow to unsteady, structured vortices near objects such as branches and stems. We examined how bumblebee flight performance differs in unsteady versus smooth flow, as well as how the orientation of unsteady flow structures affects their flight performance, by filming bumblebees flying in a wind tunnel under various flow conditions. The three-dimensional flight trajectories and orientations of bumblebees were quantified in each of three flow conditions: (1) smooth flow, (2) the unsteady wake of a vertical cylinder (inducing strong lateral disturbances) and (3) the unsteady wake of a horizontal cylinder (inducing strong vertical disturbances). In both unsteady conditions, bumblebees attenuated the disturbances induced by the wind quite effectively, but still experienced significant translational and rotational fluctuations as compared with flight in smooth flow. Bees appeared to be most sensitive to disturbance along the lateral axis, displaying large lateral accelerations, translations and rolling motions in response to both unsteady flow conditions, regardless of orientation. Bees also displayed the greatest agility around the roll axis, initiating voluntary casting maneuvers and correcting for lateral disturbances mainly through roll in all flow conditions. Both unsteady flow conditions reduced the upstream flight speed of bees, suggesting an increased cost of flight in unsteady flow, with potential implications for foraging patterns and colony energetics in natural, variable wind environments."},{"title":"Thermal dependence of cardiac function in arctic fish: implications of a warming world","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4251","abstract":"With the Arctic experiencing one of the greatest and most rapid increases in sea temperatures in modern time, predicting how Arctic marine organisms will respond to elevated temperatures has become crucial for conservation biology. Here, we examined the thermal sensitivity of cardiorespiratory performance for three closely related species of sculpins that inhabit the Arctic waters, two of which, Gymnocanthus tricuspis and Myoxocephalus scorpioides, have adapted to a restricted range within the Arctic, whereas the third species, Myoxocephalus scorpius, has a wider distribution. We tested the hypothesis that the fish restricted to Arctic cold waters would show reduced cardiorespiratory scope in response to an increase in temperature, as compared with the more eurythermal M. scorpius. As expected from their biogeography, M. scorpioides and G. tricuspis maximised cardiorespiratory performance at temperatures between 1 and 4°C, whereas M. scorpius maximised performance over a wider range of temperatures (1–10°C). Furthermore, factorial scope for cardiac output collapsed at elevated temperature for the two high-latitude species, negatively impacting their ability to support aerobically driven metabolic processes. Consequently, these results concurred with our hypothesis, suggesting that the sculpin species restricted to the Arctic are likely to be negatively impacted by increases in ocean temperatures."},{"title":"Possible age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) and corresponding change in echolocation parameters in a stranded Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4144","abstract":"The hearing and echolocation clicks of a stranded Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) in Zhuhai, China, were studied. This animal had been repeatedly observed in the wild before it was stranded and its age was estimated to be ~40 years. The animal's hearing was measured using a non-invasive auditory evoked potential (AEP) method. Echolocation clicks produced by the dolphin were recorded when the animal was freely swimming in a 7.5 m (width)×22 m (length)×4.8 m (structural depth) pool with a water depth of ~2.5 m. The hearing and echolocation clicks of the studied dolphin were compared with those of a conspecific younger individual, ~13 years of age. The results suggested that the cut-off frequency of the high-frequency hearing of the studied dolphin was ~30–40 kHz lower than that of the younger individual. The peak and centre frequencies of the clicks produced by the older dolphin were ~16 kHz lower than those of the clicks produced by the younger animal. Considering that the older dolphin was ~40 years old, its lower high-frequency hearing range with lower click peak and centre frequencies could probably be explained by age-related hearing loss (presbycusis)."},{"title":"Segment-specific and state-dependent targeting accuracy of the stick insect","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4172","abstract":"In its natural habitat, Carausius morosus climbs on the branches of bushes and trees. Previous work suggested that stick insects perform targeting movements with their hindlegs to find support more easily. It has been assumed that the animals use position information from the anterior legs to control the touchdown position of the ipsilateral posterior legs. Here we addressed the question of whether not only the hindleg but also the middle leg performs targeting, and whether targeting is still present in a walking animal when influences of mechanical coupling through the ground are removed. If this were the case, it would emphasize the role of underlying neuronal mechanisms. We studied whether targeting occurred in both legs, when the rostral neighboring leg, i.e. either the middle or the front leg, was placed at defined positions relative to the body, and analyzed targeting precision for dependency on the targeted position. Under these conditions, the touchdown positions of the hindlegs show correlation to the position of the middle leg parallel and perpendicular to the body axis, while only weak correlation exists between the middle and front legs, and only in parallel to the body axis. In continuously walking tethered animals, targeting accuracy of the hindlegs and middle legs parallel to the body axis barely differed. However, targeting became significantly more accurate perpendicular to the body axis. Our results suggest that a neural mechanism exists for controlling the touchdown position of the posterior leg but that the strength of this mechanism is segment specific and dependent on the behavioral context in which it is used."},{"title":"Bumblebee visual search for multiple learned target types","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4154","abstract":"Visual search is well studied in human psychology, but we know comparatively little about similar capacities in non-human animals. It is sometimes assumed that animal visual search is restricted to a single target at a time. In bees, for example, this limitation has been evoked to explain flower constancy, the tendency of bees to specialise on a single flower type. Few studies, however, have investigated bee visual search for multiple target types after extended learning and controlling for prior visual experience. We trained colour-naive bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) extensively in separate discrimination tasks to recognise two rewarding colours in interspersed block training sessions. We then tested them with the two colours simultaneously in the presence of distracting colours to examine whether and how quickly they were able to switch between the target colours. We found that bees switched between visual targets quickly and often. The median time taken to switch between targets was shorter than known estimates of how long traces last in bees' working memory, suggesting that their capacity to recall more than one learned target was not restricted by working memory limitations. Following our results, we propose a model of memory and learning that integrates our findings with those of previous studies investigating flower constancy."},{"title":"Neuromuscular control of hovering wingbeat kinematics in response to distinct flight challenges in the ruby-throated hummingbird, Archilochus colubris","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4161","abstract":"While producing one of the highest sustained mass-specific power outputs of any vertebrate, hovering hummingbirds must also precisely modulate the activity of their primary flight muscles to vary wingbeat kinematics and modulate lift production. Although recent studies have begun to explore how pectoralis (the primary downstroke muscle) neuromuscular activation and wingbeat kinematics are linked in hummingbirds, it is unclear whether different species modulate these features in similar ways, or consistently in response to distinct flight challenges. In addition, little is known about how the antagonist, the supracoracoideus, is modulated to power the symmetrical hovering upstroke. We obtained simultaneous recordings of wingbeat kinematics and electromyograms from the pectoralis and supracoracoideus in ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) hovering under the following conditions: (1) ambient air, (2) air density reduction trials, (3) submaximal load-lifting trials and (4) maximal load-lifting trials. Increased power output was achieved through increased stroke amplitude during air density reduction and load-lifting trials, but wingbeat frequency only increased at low air densities. Overall, relative electromyographic (EMG) intensity was the best predictor of stroke amplitude and is correlated with angular velocity of the wingtip. The relationship between muscle activation intensity and kinematics was independent of treatment type, indicating that reduced drag on the wings in hypodense air did not lead to high wingtip angular velocities independently of increased muscle work. EMG bursts consistently began and ended before muscle shortening under all conditions. During all sustained hovering, spike number per burst consistently averaged 1.2 in the pectoralis and 2.0 in the supracoracoideus. The number of spikes increased to 2.5–3 in both muscles during maximal load-lifting trials. Despite the relative kinematic symmetry of the hovering downstroke and upstroke, the supracoracoideus was activated ~1 ms earlier, EMG bursts were longer (~0.9 ms) and they exhibited 1.6 times as many spikes per burst. We hypothesize that earlier and more sustained activation of the supracoracoideus fibres is necessary to offset the greater compliance resulting from the presence of the supracoracoid tendon."},{"title":"Visual contrast and color in rapid learning of novel patterns by chicks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4184","abstract":"Biological communication signals often combine bright and dark colors, such as yellow and black, but it is unclear why such patterns are effective. The literature on aposematism suggests that high contrast patterns may be easily learnt or innately avoided, whereas studies of sexual signaling refer to their attractiveness or to their cost. Here, in experiments with poultry chicks trained to find food in patterned containers, we confirm that elevated contrast dramatically increases the rate of initial attack on novel stimuli, but this response is labile. The chicks pecked once at a novel unrewarded stimulus and then ignored it for at least 24 h. Such single trial learning has not previously been reported for birds without a positively aversive unconditioned stimulus such as quinine. We then tested and rejected two hypotheses about the function of high contrast patterns: first that the preferential responses are due to novelty, and second that elevated contrast enhances learning about a novel color. More generally, the observations are consistent with the idea that elevated contrast attracts attention, thereby enhancing both initial responses – whether positive or negative – and the rate of learning."},{"title":"Blood flow dynamics in the snake spectacle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4190","abstract":"The eyes of snakes are shielded beneath a layer of transparent integument referred to as the ‘reptilian spectacle’. Well adapted to vision by virtue of its optical transparency, it nevertheless retains one characteristic of the integument that would otherwise prove detrimental to vision: its vascularity. Given the potential consequence of spectacle blood vessels on visual clarity, one might expect adaptations to have evolved that mitigate their negative impact. Earlier research demonstrated an adaptation to their spatial layout in only one species to reduce the vessels' density in the region serving the foveal and binocular visual fields. Here, we present a study of spectacle blood flow dynamics and provide evidence of a mechanism to mitigate the spectacle blood vessels' deleterious effect on vision by regulation of blood flow through them. It was found that when snakes are at rest and undisturbed, spectacle vessels undergo cycles of dilation and constriction, such that the majority of the time the vessels are fully constricted, effectively removing them from the visual field. When snakes are presented with a visual threat, spectacle vessels constrict and remain constricted for longer periods than occur during the resting cycles, thus guaranteeing the best possible visual capabilities in times of need. Finally, during the snakes' renewal phase when they are generating a new stratum corneum, the resting cycle is abolished, spectacle vessels remain dilated and blood flow remains strong and continuous. The significance of these findings in terms of the visual capabilities and physiology of snakes is discussed."},{"title":"RNA interference of glycerol biosynthesis suppresses rapid cold hardening of the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4196","abstract":"The beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, is a freeze-susceptible species that overwinters in temperate zones without diapause. A rapid cold hardening (RCH) and supercooling capacity usually play crucial roles in survival during the overwintering period. This study identified a cryoprotectant as a RCH factor of S. exigua. Pre-exposure of S. exigua larvae to 4°C significantly increased survival at −10°C in all developmental stages from egg to adult. RCH was dependent on the duration of the pre-exposure period. RCH also significantly enhanced the supercooling capacity. Cryoprotectant analysis using HPLC showed that the pre-exposure treatment allowed the larvae to accumulate glycerol in the hemolymph. Two genes, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) and glycerol kinase (GK), were identified as being associated with glycerol biosynthesis, and were cloned from S. exigua larvae. Both GPDH and GK were expressed in all developmental stages of S. exigua. RNA interference (RNAi) of either GPDH or GK significantly inhibited glycerol accumulation in the hemolymph of S. exigua. Larvae treated with RNAi for GPDH or GK exhibited a significant decrease in RCH capacity. The glycerol accumulation in response to 4°C appeared to be under the control of a humoral signal, because a ligation experiment prevented glycerol accumulation in the other half of the body. This study indicates that glycerol is a RCH factor of S. exigua and its synthesis is in response to low temperature via humoral mediation."},{"title":"Regulatory role of PGC-1α/PPAR signaling in skeletal muscle metabolic recruitment during cold acclimation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4233","abstract":"This study examined the molecular basis of energy-related regulatory mechanisms underlying metabolic recruitment of skeletal muscle during cold acclimation and possible involvement of the l-arginine/nitric oxide-producing pathway. Rats exposed to cold (4±1°C) for periods of 1, 3, 7, 12, 21 and 45 days were divided into three groups: untreated, l-arginine treated and Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) treated. Compared with controls (22±1°C), there was an initial increase in the protein level of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase α (day 1), followed by an increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs): PPARα and PPARγ from day 1 and PPARδ from day 7 of cold acclimation. Activation of the PGC-1α/PPAR transcription program was accompanied by increased protein expression of the key metabolic enzymes in β-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, with the exceptions in complex I (no changes) and ATP synthase (decreased at day 1). Cold did not affect hexokinase and GAPDH protein levels, but increased lactate dehydrogenase activity compared with controls (1–45 days). l-arginine sustained, accelerated and/or intensified cold-induced molecular remodeling throughout cold acclimation. l-NAME exerted phase-dependent effects: similar to l-arginine in early cold acclimation and opposite after prolonged cold exposure (from day 21). It seems that upregulation of the PGC-1α/PPAR transcription program early during cold acclimation triggers the molecular recruitment of skeletal muscle underlying the shift to more oxidative metabolism during prolonged cold acclimation. Our results suggest that nitric oxide has a role in maintaining the skeletal muscle oxidative phenotype in late cold acclimation but question its role early in cold acclimation."},{"title":"Immune response to a Trichinella spiralis infection in house mice from lines selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4212","abstract":"Four lines of mice bred for high voluntary wheel running (HR lines) have high baseline circulating corticosterone levels and increased daily energy expenditure as compared with four non-selected control (C) lines. High corticosterone may suppress immune function and competing energy demands may limit ability to mount an immune response. We hypothesized that HR mice have a reduced immune response and therefore a decreased ability to fight an infection by Trichinella spiralis, an ecologically relevant nematode common in mammals. Infections have an acute, intestinal phase while the nematode is migrating, reproducing and traveling throughout the bloodstream, followed by a chronic phase with larvae encysted in muscles. Adult males (generation 55 of the selection experiment) were sham-infected or infected by oral gavage with ~300 J1 T. spiralis larvae. During the chronic phase of infection, mice were given wheel access for 6 days, followed by 2 days of maximum aerobic performance trials. Two weeks post-infection, infected HR had significantly lower circulating immunoglobulin E levels compared with infected C mice. However, we found no statistical difference between infected HR and C mice in numbers of encysted larvae within the diaphragm. As expected, both voluntary running and maximum aerobic performance were significantly higher in HR mice and lower in infected mice, with no line type-by-infection interactions. Results complement those of previous studies suggesting decreased locomotor abilities during the chronic phase of T. spiralis infection. However, despite reduced antibody production, breeding for high voluntary wheel exercise does not appear to have a substantial negative impact on general humoral function."},{"title":"Experimental verification of dynamic soaring in albatrosses","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4222","abstract":"Dynamic soaring is a small-scale flight manoeuvre which is the basis for the extreme flight performance of albatrosses and other large seabirds to travel huge distances in sustained non-flapping flight. As experimental data with sufficient resolution of th ese small-scale movements are not available, knowledge is lacking about dynamic soaring and the physical mechanism of the energy gain of the bird from the wind. With new in-house developments of GPS logging units for recording raw phase observations and of a dedicated mathematical method for postprocessing these measurements, it was possible to determine the small-scale flight manoeuvre with the required high precision. Experimental results from tracking 16 wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans) in the southern Indian Ocean show the characteristic pattern of dynamic soaring. This pattern consists of four flight phases comprising a windward climb, an upper curve, a leeward descent and a lower curve, which are continually repeated. It is shown that the primary energy gain from the shear wind is attained in the upper curve where the bird changes the flight direction from windward to leeward. As a result, the upper curve is the characteristic flight phase of dynamic soaring for achieving the energy gain necessary for sustained non-flapping flight."},{"title":"Cryptic impacts of temperature variability on amphibian immune function","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4204","abstract":"Ectothermic species living in temperate regions can experience rapid and potentially stressful changes in body temperature driven by abrupt weather changes. Yet, among amphibians, the physiological impacts of short-term temperature variation are largely unknown. Using an ex situ population of Cryptobranchus alleganiensis, an aquatic North American salamander, we tested the hypothesis that naturally occurring periods of temperature variation negatively impact amphibian health, either through direct effects on immune function or by increasing physiological stress. We exposed captive salamanders to repeated cycles of temperature fluctuations recorded in the population's natal stream and evaluated behavioral and physiological responses, including plasma complement activity (i.e. bacteria killing) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophila. The best-fit model (ΔAICc=0, wi=0.9992) revealed 70% greater P. aeruginosa killing after exposure to variable temperatures and no evidence of thermal acclimation. The same model predicted 50% increased E. coli killing, but had weaker support (ΔAICc=1.8, wi=0.2882). In contrast, plasma defenses were ineffective against A. hydrophila, and other health indicators (leukocyte ratios, growth rates and behavioral patterns) were maintained at baseline values. Our data suggest that amphibians can tolerate, and even benefit from, natural patterns of rapid warming/cooling. Specifically, temperature variation can elicit increased activity of the innate immune system. This immune response may be adaptive in an unpredictable environment, and is undetectable by conventional health indicators (and hence considered cryptic). Our findings highlight the need to consider naturalistic patterns of temperature variation when predicting species' susceptibility to climate change."},{"title":"Effects of reproduction on immuno-suppression and oxidative damage, and hence support or otherwise for their roles as mechanisms underpinning life history trade-offs, are tissue and assay dependent","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/22/4242","abstract":"Life history parameters appear to be traded off against each other, but the physiological mechanisms involved remain unclear. One hypothesis is that potentially energetically costly processes such as immune function and protection from oxidative stress may be compromised during reproductive attempts because of selective resource allocation. Lower temperatures also impose energy costs, and hence allocation decisions might be more pronounced when animals are forced to reproduce in the cold. Here, we experimentally tested whether reproduction at different ambient temperatures was associated with elevated oxidative stress and suppressed immune function in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). Using a variety of different markers for both immune function and oxidative stress, we found that some measures of immune function (serum bactericidal capacity and size of the thymus) were significantly suppressed, while some measures of oxidative protection [serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity] were also reduced, and a marker of oxidative damage (protein carbonyls in serum) was increased in lactating compared with non-reproductive gerbils. These changes were in line with the selective resource allocation predictions. However, the phytohaemagglutinin response and serum total immunoglobulin (IgG) were not suppressed, and other markers of oxidative damage [malondialdehyde (MDA) (TBARS) and protein carbonyls in the liver] were actually lower in lactating compared with non-reproductive gerbils, consistent with increased levels of SOD activity and total antioxidant capacity in the liver. These latter changes were opposite of the expectations based on resource allocation. Furthermore, other measures of protection (GPx levels in the liver and protein thiols in both serum and liver) and damage [MDA (TBARS) in serum] were unrelated to reproductive status. Ambient temperature differences did not impact on these patterns. Collectively, our results indicated that the inferred effects of reproduction on immunosuppression and oxidative damage, and hence support or otherwise for particular physiological mechanisms that underpin life history trade-offs, are critically dependent on the exact markers and tissues used. This may be because during reproduction individuals selectively allocate protection to some key tissues, but sacrifice protection of others."},{"title":"Chasing maximal performance: a cautionary tale from the celebrated jumping frogs of Calaveras County","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/3947","abstract":"Maximal performance is an essential metric for understanding many aspects of an organism's biology, but it can be difficult to determine because a measured maximum may reflect only a peak level of effort, not a physiological limit. We used a unique opportunity provided by a frog jumping contest to evaluate the validity of existing laboratory estimates of maximum jumping performance in bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana). We recorded video of 3124 bullfrog jumps over the course of the 4-day contest at the Calaveras County Jumping Frog Jubilee, and determined jump distance from these images and a calibration of the jump arena. Frogs were divided into two groups: ‘rental’ frogs collected by fair organizers and jumped by the general public, and frogs collected and jumped by experienced, ‘professional’ teams. A total of 58% of recorded jumps surpassed the maximum jump distance in the literature (1.295 m), and the longest jump was 2.2 m. Compared with rental frogs, professionally jumped frogs jumped farther, and the distribution of jump distances for this group was skewed towards long jumps. Calculated muscular work, historical records and the skewed distribution of jump distances all suggest that the longest jumps represent the true performance limit for this species. Using resampling, we estimated the probability of observing a given jump distance for various sample sizes, showing that large sample sizes are required to detect rare maximal jumps. These results show the importance of sample size, animal motivation and physiological conditions for accurate maximal performance estimates."},{"title":"The simple ears of noctuoid moths are tuned to the calls of their sympatric bat community","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/3954","abstract":"Insects with bat-detecting ears are ideal animals for investigating sensory system adaptations to predator cues. Noctuid moths have two auditory receptors (A1 and A2) sensitive to the ultrasonic echolocation calls of insectivorous bats. Larger moths are detected at greater distances by bats than smaller moths. Larger moths also have lower A1 best thresholds, allowing them to detect bats at greater distances and possibly compensating for their increased conspicuousness. Interestingly, the sound frequency at the lowest threshold is lower in larger than in smaller moths, suggesting that the relationship between threshold and size might vary across frequencies used by different bat species. Here, we demonstrate that the relationships between threshold and size in moths were only significant at some frequencies, and these frequencies differed between three locations (UK, Canada and Denmark). The relationships were more likely to be significant at call frequencies used by proportionately more bat species in the moths' specific bat community, suggesting an association between the tuning of moth ears and the cues provided by sympatric predators. Additionally, we found that the best threshold and best frequency of the less sensitive A2 receptor are also related to size, and that these relationships hold when controlling for evolutionary relationships. The slopes of best threshold versus size differ, however, such that the difference in threshold between A1 and A2 is greater for larger than for smaller moths. The shorter time from A1 to A2 excitation in smaller than in larger moths could potentially compensate for shorter absolute detection distances in smaller moths."},{"title":"Biomechanics and energetics of walking on uneven terrain","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/3963","abstract":"Walking on uneven terrain is more energetically costly than walking on smooth ground, but the biomechanical factors that contribute to this increase are unknown. To identify possible factors, we constructed an uneven terrain treadmill that allowed us to record biomechanical, electromyographic and metabolic energetics data from human subjects. We hypothesized that walking on uneven terrain would increase step width and length variability, joint mechanical work and muscle co-activation compared with walking on smooth terrain. We tested healthy subjects (N=11) walking at 1.0 m s−1, and found that, when walking on uneven terrain with up to 2.5 cm variation, subjects decreased their step length by 4% and did not significantly change their step width, while both step length and width variability increased significantly (22 and 36%, respectively; P<0.05). Uneven terrain walking caused a 28 and 62% increase in positive knee and hip work, respectively, and a 26% greater magnitude of negative knee work (0.0106, 0.1078 and 0.0425 J kg−1, respectively; P<0.05). Mean muscle activity increased in seven muscles in the lower leg and thigh (P<0.05). These changes caused overall net metabolic energy expenditure to increase by 0.73 W kg−1 (28%; P<0.0001). Much of that increase could be explained by the increased mechanical work observed at the knee and hip. Greater muscle co-activation could also contribute to increased energetic cost but to unknown degree. The findings provide insight into how lower limb muscles are used differently for natural terrain compared with laboratory conditions."},{"title":"Activity of intestinal carbohydrases responds to multiple dietary signals in nestling house sparrows","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/3981","abstract":"The ‘adaptive modulation hypothesis’ predicts that activity of digestive enzymes should match the amount of their substrates in diet. Interestingly, many passerine birds do not adjust the activity of intestinal carbohydrases to dietary carbohydrate content. It is difficult to assess the generality of this rule, because in some studies passerines fed on low-carbohydrate and high-lipid diet showed reduced activity of intestinal carbohydrases. However, as carbohydrase activity may be inhibited by high dietary lipid content, it is unclear whether observed effects reflected lack of induction by the low carbohydrate levels or suppression by the high lipid levels. Here, we isolated the specific effects of dietary carbohydrate and lipid on carbohydrases. We hand-fed house sparrow nestlings on diets with 25% starch and 8% lipid (diet HS), no starch and 20% lipid (HL), or 25% starch and 20% lipid (HSL). Our results show that activity of intestinal carbohydrases is simultaneously induced by dietary carbohydrates and decreased by dietary lipid, although the latter effect seems stronger. Activities of maltase and sucrase summed over the total intestine decreased in the order HS>HSL>HL. We observed a complex interaction between diet composition and intestinal position for mass-specific activity of these enzymes, suggesting site-specific responses to changes in digesta composition along the intestines caused by digestion and absorption. We re-interpret results of earlier studies and conclude that there is no unequivocal example of adaptive modulation of intestinal carbohydrases by dietary carbohydrate in adult passerine birds, whereas the present experiment confirms that nestlings of at least some species possess such capacity."},{"title":"The role of hind limb tendons in gibbon locomotion: springs or strings?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/3971","abstract":"Tendon properties have an important effect on the mechanical behaviour of muscles, with compliant tendons allowing near-isometric muscle contraction and facilitating elastic energy storage and recoil. Stiff tendons, in contrast, facilitate rapid force transfer and precise positional control. In humans, the long Achilles tendon contributes to the mechanical efficiency of running via elastic energy storage and recovery, and its presence has been linked to the evolution of habitual bipedalism. Gibbons also possess relatively long hind limb tendons; however, their role is as yet unknown. Based on their large dimensions, and inferring from the situation in humans, we hypothesize that the tendons in the gibbon hind limb will facilitate elastic energy storage and recoil during hind-limb-powered locomotion. To investigate this, we determined the material properties of the gibbon Achilles and patellar tendon in vitro and linked this with available kinematic and kinetic data to evaluate their role in leaping and bipedalism. Tensile tests were conducted on tendon samples using a material testing machine and the load–displacement data were used to calculate stiffness, Young's modulus and hysteresis. In addition, the average stress-in-life and energy absorption capacity of both tendons were estimated. We found a functional difference between the gibbon Achilles and patellar tendon, with the Achilles tendon being more suitable for elastic energy storage and release. The patellar tendon, in contrast, has a relatively high hysteresis, making it less suitable to act as elastic spring. This suggests that the gibbon Achilles tendon might fulfil a similar function as in humans, contributing to reducing the locomotor cost of bipedalism by acting as elastic spring, while the high stiffness of the patellar tendon might favour fast force transfer upon recoil and, possibly, enhance leaping performance."},{"title":"Launches, squiggles and pounces, oh my! The water–land transition in mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/3988","abstract":"Mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) are small fusiform teleosts (Cyprinodontiformes) with the ability to locomote on land, despite lacking apparent morphological adaptations for terrestrial movement. Rivulus will leave their aquatic habitat for moist, terrestrial environments when water conditions are poor, or, as we show here, to capture terrestrial insects. Specimens were conditioned to eat pinhead crickets on one side of their aquaria. After 2 weeks of conditioning, a barrier with a slope of 15 deg was partially submerged in the middle of the tank, forcing the fish to transition from water to land and back into water in order to feed. Kinematics during the transition were recorded using Fastec high-speed video cameras (125–250 frames s−1). Videos were analyzed using Didge and ImageJ software programs. Transition behaviors were characterized and analyzed according to their specific type. Body oscillation amplitude and wave duration were quantified for movements along the substrate, along with initial velocity for launching behaviors. Kryptolebias marmoratus used a diverse suite of behaviors to transition from water to land. These behaviors can be categorized as launches, squiggles and pounces. Prey were captured terrestrially and brought underwater for consumption. Kryptolebias marmoratus's suite of behaviors represents a novel solution to non-tetrapodal terrestrial transition, which suggests that fishes may have been able to exploit land habitats transiently, without leaving any apparent evidence in the fossil record."},{"title":"Mate preference in the painted goby: the influence of visual and acoustic courtship signals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/3996","abstract":"We tested the hypothesis that females of a small vocal marine fish with exclusive paternal care, the painted goby, prefer high parental-quality mates such as large or high-condition males. We tested the effect of male body size and male visual and acoustic courtship behaviour (playback experiments) on female mating preferences by measuring time spent near one of a two-choice stimuli. Females did not show preference for male size but preferred males that showed higher levels of courtship, a trait known to advertise condition (fat reserves). Also, time spent near the preferred male depended on male courtship effort. Playback experiments showed that when sound was combined with visual stimuli (a male confined in a small aquarium placed near each speaker), females spent more time near the male associated with courtship sound than with the control male (associated with white noise or silence). Although male visual courtship effort also affected female preference in the pre-playback period, this effect decreased during playback and disappeared in the post-playback period. Courtship sound stimuli alone did not elicit female preference in relation to a control. Taken together, the results suggest that visual and mainly acoustic courtship displays are subject to mate preference and may advertise parental quality in this species. Our results indicate that visual and acoustic signals interplay in a complex fashion and highlight the need to examine how different sensory modalities affect mating preferences in fish and other vertebrates."},{"title":"Seasonality influences cuticle melanization and immune defense in a cricket: support for a temperature-dependent immune investment hypothesis in insects","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4005","abstract":"To improve thermoregulation in colder environments, insects are expected to darken their cuticles with melanin via the phenoloxidase cascade, a phenomenon predicted by the thermal melanin hypothesis. However, the phenoloxidase cascade also plays a significant role in insect immunity, leading to the additional hypothesis that the thermal environment indirectly shapes immune function via direct selection on cuticle color. Support for the latter hypothesis comes from the cricket Allonemobius socius, where cuticle darkness and immune-related phenoloxidase activity increase with latitude. However, thermal environments vary seasonally as well as geographically, suggesting that seasonal plasticity in immunity may also exist. Although seasonal fluctuations in vertebrate immune function are common (because of flux in breeding or resource abundance), seasonality in invertebrate immunity has not been widely explored. We addressed this possibility by rearing crickets in simulated summer and fall environments and assayed their cuticle color and immune function. Prior to estimating immunity, crickets were placed in a common environment to minimize metabolic rate differences. Individuals reared under fall-like conditions exhibited darker cuticles, greater phenoloxidase activity and greater resistance to the bacteria Serratia marcescens. These data support the hypothesis that changes in the thermal environment modify cuticle color, which indirectly shapes immune investment through pleiotropy. This hypothesis may represent a widespread mechanism governing immunity in numerous systems, considering that most insects operate in seasonally and geographically variable thermal environments."},{"title":"The spatiotemporal dynamics of rheotactic behavior depends on flow speed and available sensory information","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4011","abstract":"Rheotaxis is a robust, multisensory behavior with many potential benefits for fish and other aquatic organisms. Visual (optic flow) cues appear to be sufficient for rheotaxis, but other sensory cues can clearly compensate for the loss of vision. Nevertheless, the nature of multisensory interactions and the relative contributions of different senses under varying conditions are poorly understood – largely because there is so little description of the actual behavior. Here, we examined the effects of different flow speeds and different sensory conditions on the spatiotemporal dynamics of rheotaxis. Although the overall ability of giant danio (Devario aequipinnatus) to head upstream is largely unaffected by either unimodal or bimodal deprivation of visual and/or lateral line senses, the spatiotemporal form of the behavior is altered in subtle ways. When deprived of vision, fish move further upstream, but the angular accuracy of the upstream heading is reduced. In addition, visually deprived fish exhibit left/right sweeping movements near the upstream barrier at low flow speeds. Sweeping movements are abolished when these fish are additionally deprived of lateral line information. These results indicate that fish adopt different sensorimotor strategies to compensate for the loss of one or more senses and that the nature of multisensory interactions is a complex function of flow speed."},{"title":"A new approach to evaluate multimodal orientation behaviour of migratory passerine birds recorded in circular orientation cages","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4038","abstract":"Circular orientation cages have been used for several decades to record the migratory orientation of passerine migrants, and have been central to the investigation of the functional characteristics of the biological compasses used for orientation. The use of these cages offers unique possibilities to study the migratory behaviour of songbirds, but suffers from statistical limitations in evaluating the directions of the activity recorded in the cages. The migratory activity has been reported to vary, including complex multimodal orientation of migratory passerines tested in orientation cages irrespective of species studied. The currently applied circular statistical methods fail to describe orientation responses differing from unimodal and axial distributions. We propose for the first time a modelling procedure enabling the analysis of multimodal distributions at either an individual or a group level. In this paper we compare the results of conventional methods and the recommended modelling approach. Migratory routes may be more complex than a simple migratory direction, and multimodal behaviour in migratory species at the individual and population levels can be advantageous. Individuals may select the expected migratory direction, but may also return to safer sites en route, i.e. sites already known, which provide food and/or shelter in reverse directions. In individual birds, several directions may be expressed in the same test hour. At the species level, multimodal orientation may give an opportunity to expand the range or may refer to differential migration route preferences in different populations of birds. A conflicting experimental situation may also result in a different preferential orientation. In this paper we suggest a statistical solution to deal with these types of variations in orientation preference."},{"title":"Sensitivity of ventilation and brain metabolism to ammonia exposure in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4025","abstract":"Ammonia has been documented as a respiratory gas that stimulates ventilation, and is sensed by peripheral neuroepithelial cells (NECs) in the gills in ammoniotelic rainbow trout. However, the hyperventilatory response is abolished in trout chronically exposed (1+ months) to high environmental ammonia [HEA; 250 μmol l−1 (NH4)2SO4]. This study investigates whether the brain is involved in the acute sensitivity of ventilation to ammonia, and whether changes in brain metabolism are related to the loss of hyperventilatory responses in trout chronically exposed to HEA (‘HEA trout’). Hyperventilation (via increased ventilatory amplitude rather than rate) and increased total ammonia concentration ([TAmm]) in brain tissue were induced in parallel by acute HEA exposure in control trout in a concentration-series experiment [500, 750 and 1000 μmol l−1 (NH4)2SO4], but these inductions were abolished in HEA trout. Ventilation was correlated more closely to [TAmm] in brain rather than to [TAmm] in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid. The close correlation of hyperventilation and increased brain [TAmm] also occurred in control trout acutely exposed to HEA in a time-series analysis [500 μmol l−1 (NH4)2SO4; 15, 30, 45 and 60 min], as well as in a methionine sulfoxamine (MSOX) pre-injection experiment [to inhibit glutamine synthetase (GSase)]. These correlations consistently suggest that brain [TAmm] is involved in the hyperventilatory responses to ammonia in trout. The MSOX treatments, together with measurements of GSase activity, TAmm, glutamine and glutamate concentrations in brain tissue, were conducted in both the control and HEA trout. These experiments revealed that GSase plays an important role in transferring ammonia to glutamate to make glutamine in trout brain, thereby attenuating the elevation of brain [TAmm] following HEA exposure, and that glutamate concentration is reduced in HEA trout. The mRNAs for the ammonia channel proteins Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2 were expressed in trout brain, and the expression of Rhbg and Rhcg2 increased in HEA trout, potentially as a mechanism to facilitate the efflux of ammonia. In summary, the brain appears to be involved in the sensitivity of ventilation to ammonia, and brain ammonia levels are regulated metabolically in trout."},{"title":"Discovery of a novel neurophysin-associated neuropeptide that triggers cardiac stomach contraction and retraction in starfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4047","abstract":"Feeding in starfish is a remarkable process in which the cardiac stomach is everted over prey and then retracted when prey tissue has been resorbed. Previous studies have revealed that SALMFamide-type neuropeptides trigger cardiac stomach relaxation and eversion in the starfish Asterias rubens. We hypothesized, therefore, that a counteracting neuropeptide system controls cardiac stomach contraction and retraction. Members of the NG peptide family cause muscle contraction in other echinoderms (e.g. NGFFFamide in sea urchins and NGIWYamide in sea cucumbers), so we investigated NG peptides as candidate regulators of cardiac stomach retraction in starfish. Generation and analysis of neural transcriptome sequence data from A. rubens revealed a precursor protein comprising two copies of a novel NG peptide, NGFFYamide, which was confirmed by mass spectrometry. A noteworthy feature of the NGFFYamide precursor is a C-terminal neurophysin domain, indicative of a common ancestry with vasopressin/oxytocin-type neuropeptide precursors. Interestingly, in precursors of other NG peptides the neurophysin domain has been retained (e.g. NGFFFamide) or lost (e.g. NGIWYamide and human neuropeptide S) and its functional significance remains to be determined. Investigation of the pharmacological actions of NGFFYamide in starfish revealed that it is a potent stimulator of cardiac stomach contraction in vitro and that it triggers cardiac stomach retraction in vivo. Thus, discovery of NGFFYamide provides a novel insight into neural regulation of cardiac stomach retraction as well as a rationale for chemically based strategies to control starfish that feed on economically important shellfish (e.g. mussels) or protected marine fauna (e.g. coral)."},{"title":"Cold exposure increases intestinal paracellular permeability to nutrients in the mouse","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4065","abstract":"In situations of increased energy demand and food intake, animals can often acclimate within several days. The intestine generally responds to elevated digestive demand by increasing in size. However, there is likely a limit to how quickly the intestine can grow to meet the new demand. We investigated the immediate and longer-term changes to intestinal properties of the mouse when suddenly exposed to 4°C. We hypothesized that paracellular permeability to nutrients would increase as part of an immediate response to elevated absorptive demand. We measured absorption of l-arabinose, intestinal size and gene expression of several tight junction proteins (claudin-2, claudin-4, claudin-15 and ZO-1) at three time points: pre-exposure, and after 1 day and 2 weeks of cold exposure. Cold exposure increased food intake by 62% after 2 weeks but intake was not significantly increased after 1 day. Intestinal wet mass was elevated after 1 day and throughout the experiment. Absorption of arabinose rose by 20% after 1 day in the cold and was 33% higher after 2 weeks. Expression of claudin-2 increased after 1 day of cold exposure, but there were no changes in expression of any claudin genes when normalized to ZO-1 expression. Our results indicate that intestinal mass can respond rapidly to increased energy demand and that increased paracellular permeability is also part of that response. Increased paracellular permeability may be a consequence of enterocyte hyperplasia, resulting in more tight junctions across which molecules can absorb."},{"title":"Experimental relationships between levels of corticosterone in plasma and feathers in a free-living bird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4071","abstract":"Integrated measures of corticosterone (CORT), such as from feathers (CORTf), have intuitive appeal because they incorporate both the duration and amplitude of glucocorticoid secretion. An association between CORTf and plasma CORT has never been shown in wild birds, and it is unclear as to when and whether these measures should be correlated, given that they are fundamentally different yet related measures of physiology. We hypothesized that CORTf should correlate with instantaneous measurements of plasma CORT when the latter reflect sustained changes in the activity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. To test this, we experimentally manipulated levels of plasma CORT in wild nestling tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) using 5 day time-release CORT pellets, and measured plasma CORT and growth parameters before, during and at the end of hormone manipulation (days 7, 9 and 11 post-hatch, respectively). CORTf and plasma CORT were significantly positively related only when the latter was at its highest and most variable among individuals (day 9). A similar relationship was expected at day 11, but plasma CORT had returned to near-original levels. Nestlings with higher CORTf were smaller, lighter and less likely to fledge, but we did not detect seasonal effects on CORTf. Our results clearly demonstrate that CORTf from free-living birds can reflect plasma CORT, but correlations may not always be expected, especially if elevations in plasma CORT are relatively modest and of short duration. Our work suggests that CORTf is best used to study the activity of the HPA axis over relatively long time frames and can be used effectively to advance avian ecology."},{"title":"Spectral sensitivity of the ctenid spider Cupiennius salei","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4103","abstract":"The spectral sensitivity of adult male Cupiennius salei Keys, a nocturnal hunting spider, was studied in a behavioural test. As known from earlier behavioural tests, C. salei will walk towards a black target presented in front of a white background. In this study, a black target (size 42×70 cm) was presented in a white arena illuminated by monochromatic light in the range 365–695 nm using 19 monochromatic filters (half-width in the range 6–10 nm). In the first trial, the transmission of the optical filters was between 40% and 80%. In the second trial, the transmission was reduced to 5% using a neutral density filter. At the high intensity, the spiders showed a spectral sensitivity in the range 380–670 nm. In the second trial, the animals only showed directed walks if the illumination was in the range 449–599 nm, indicating a lower sensitivity at the margins of the spectral sensitivity. In previous intracellular recordings, the measured spectral sensitivity was between 320 and 620 nm. Interestingly, these results do not completely match the behaviourally tested spectral sensitivity of the photoreceptors, where the sensitivity range is shifted to longer wavelengths. In order to investigate the molecular background of spectral sensitivity, we searched for opsin genes in C. salei. We found three visual opsins that correspond to UV and middle to long wavelength sensitive opsins as described for jumping spiders."},{"title":"Quantifying energy intake in Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) using the heat increment of feeding","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4109","abstract":"Using implanted archival tags, we examined the effects of meal caloric value, food type (sardine or squid) and ambient temperature on the magnitude and duration of the heat increment of feeding in three captive juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna. The objective of our study was to develop a model that can be used to estimate energy intake in wild fish of similar body mass. Both the magnitude and duration of the heat increment of feeding (measured by visceral warming) showed a strong positive correlation with the caloric value of the ingested meal. Controlling for meal caloric value, the extent of visceral warming was significantly greater at lower ambient temperature. The extent of visceral warming was also significantly higher for squid meals compared with sardine meals. By using a hierarchical Bayesian model to analyze our data and treating individuals as random effects, we demonstrate how increases in visceral temperature can be used to estimate the energy intake of wild Pacific bluefin tuna of similar body mass to the individuals used in our study."},{"title":"RNA-Seq reveals early distinctions and late convergence of gene expression between diapause and quiescence in the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4082","abstract":"Dormancy is a crucial adaptation allowing insects to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The pre-programmed developmental arrest of diapause is a form of dormancy that is distinct from quiescence, in which development arrests in immediate response to hardship. Much progress has been made in understanding the environmental and hormonal controls of diapause. However, studies identifying transcriptional changes unique to diapause, rather than quiescence, are lacking, making it difficult to disentangle the transcriptional profiles of diapause from dormancy in general. The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, presents an ideal model for such a study, as diapausing and quiescent eggs can be staged and collected for global gene expression profiling using a newly developed transcriptome. Here, we use RNA-Seq to contrast gene expression during diapause with quiescence to identify transcriptional changes specific to the diapause response. We identify global trends in gene expression that show gradual convergence of diapause gene expression upon gene expression during quiescence. Functionally, early diapause A. albopictus show strong expression differences of genes involved in metabolism, which diminish over time. Of these, only expression of lipid metabolism genes remained distinct in late diapause. We identify several genes putatively related to hormonal control of development that are persistently differentially expressed throughout diapause, suggesting these might be involved in the maintenance of diapause. Our results identify key biological differences between diapausing and quiescent pharate larvae, and suggest candidate pathways for studying metabolism and the hormonal control of development during diapause in other species."},{"title":"Aversive conditioning in honey bees (Apis mellifera anatolica): a comparison of drones and workers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4124","abstract":"Honey bees provide a model system to elucidate the relationship between sociality and complex behaviors within the same species, as females (workers) are highly social and males (drones) are more solitary. We report on aversive learning studies in drone and worker honey bees (Apis mellifera anatolica) in escape, punishment and discriminative punishment situations. In all three experiments, a newly developed electric shock avoidance assay was used. The comparisons of expected and observed responses were performed with conventional statistical methods and a systematic randomization modeling approach called object oriented modeling. The escape experiment consisted of two measurements recorded in a master–yoked paradigm: frequency of response and latency to respond following administration of shock. Master individuals could terminate an unavoidable shock triggered by a decrementing 30 s timer by crossing the shuttlebox centerline following shock activation. Across all groups, there was large individual response variation. When assessing group response frequency and latency, master subjects performed better than yoked subjects for both workers and drones. In the punishment experiment, individuals were shocked upon entering the shock portion of a bilaterally wired shuttlebox. The shock portion was spatially static and unsignalled. Only workers effectively avoided the shock. The discriminative punishment experiment repeated the punishment experiment but included a counterbalanced blue and yellow background signal and the side of shock was manipulated. Drones correctly responded less than workers when shock was paired with blue. However, when shock was paired with yellow there was no observable difference between drones and workers."},{"title":"Nasal sound production in echolocating delphinids (Tursiops truncatus and Pseudorca crassidens) is dynamic, but unilateral: clicking on the right side and whistling on the left side","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4091","abstract":"Toothed whales produce sound in their nasal complex by pneumatic actuation of phonic lip pairs within the blowhole. It has been hypothesized that dual actuation of the phonic lip pairs can generate two pulses that merge to form a single echolocation click with a higher source level, broader bandwidth and larger potential for beam steering than if produced by a single pair of phonic lips. Here, we test that hypothesis by measuring the sound production of five echolocating delphinids using hydrophones around the animals and imbedded in on-animal suction cups. We show that the studied animals click with their right pair of phonic lips and whistle with their left pair. We demonstrate that, with just a single pair of phonic lips, they can change the click energy levels over five orders of magnitude, change the click centroid frequencies over more than two octaves, and modulate the sound radiation from the melon for beam steering. We conclude that all of the click dynamics ascribed to dual actuation of two phonic lip pairs can be achieved with actuation of just the right pair of phonic lips, and we propose that the large dynamic range of source outputs is achieved by highly controlled modulation of the pneumatic driving pressure, the tension of the phonic lip labia and the conformation of the fatty melon and associated air sacs."},{"title":"Assessing the relative importance of environmental effects, carry-over effects and species differences in thermal stress resistance: a comparison of Drosophilids across field and laboratory generations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3790","abstract":"There is increasing interest in comparing species of related organisms for their susceptibility to thermal extremes in order to evaluate potential vulnerability to climate change. Comparisons are typically undertaken on individuals collected from the field with or without a period of acclimation. However, this approach does not allow the potential contributions of environmental and carry-over effects across generations to be separated from inherent species differences in susceptibility. To assess the importance of these different sources of variation, we here considered heat and cold resistance in Drosophilid species from tropical and temperate sites in the field and across two laboratory generations. Resistance in field-collected individuals tended to be lower when compared with F1 and F2 laboratory generations, and species differences in field flies were only weakly correlated to differences established under controlled rearing conditions, unlike in F1–F2 comparisons. This reflected large environmental effects on resistance associated with different sites and conditions experienced within sites. For the 8 h cold recovery assay there was no strong evidence of carry-over effects, whereas for the heat knockdown and 2 h cold recovery assays there was some evidence for such effects. However, for heat these were species specific in direction. Variance components for inherent species differences were substantial for resistance to heat and 8 h cold stress, but small for 2 h cold stress, though this may be a reflection of the species being considered in the comparisons. These findings highlight that inherent differences among species are difficult to characterise accurately without controlling for environmental sources of variation and carry-over effects. Moreover, they also emphasise the complex nature of carry-over effects that vary depending on the nature of stress traits and the species being evaluated."},{"title":"Nonshivering thermogenesis in the African lesser bushbaby, Galago moholi","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3811","abstract":"The capacity for nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) plays an important role during arousal from torpid states. Recent data on heterotherms inhabiting warmer regions, however, suggest that passive rewarming reduces the need of metabolic heat production during arousal significantly, leading to the question: to what extent do subtropical or tropical heterotherms depend on NST? The African lesser bushbaby, Galago moholi, enters torpid states as an emergency response only, but otherwise stays normothermic throughout the cold and dry winter season. In addition, this species shows unusual rewarming difficulties during arousal from torpor on cold days. We therefore examined the seasonal adjustments of the capacity for NST of naturally acclimatized G. moholi by stimulation with noradrenaline (NA) injection. Dissection of two adult female bushbabies revealed that G. moholi possesses brown adipose tissue, and NA treatment (0.5 mg kg−1, s.c.) induced a significant elevation in oxygen consumption compared with control (saline) injection. However, the increase in oxygen consumption following injection of NA was not significantly different between winter and summer. Our results show that the ability to produce heat via NST seems to be available throughout the year and that G. moholi is able to change NST capacity within a very short time frame in response to cold spells. Together with results from studies on other (Afro-)tropical heterotherms, which also indicate low or even absent seasonal difference in NST capacity, this raises the question of whether the definition of NST needs to be refined for (Afro-)tropical mammals."},{"title":"Complex vibratory patterns in an elephant larynx","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/21/4054","abstract":"Elephants' low-frequency vocalizations are produced by flow-induced self-sustaining oscillations of laryngeal tissue. To date, little is known in detail about the vibratory phenomena in the elephant larynx. Here, we provide a first descriptive report of the complex oscillatory features found in the excised larynx of a 25 year old female African elephant (Loxodonta africana), the largest animal sound generator ever studied experimentally. Sound production was documented with high-speed video, acoustic measurements, air flow and sound pressure level recordings. The anatomy of the larynx was studied with computed tomography (CT) and dissections. Elephant CT vocal anatomy data were further compared with the anatomy of an adult human male. We observed numerous unusual phenomena, not typically reported in human vocal fold vibrations. Phase delays along both the inferior–superior and anterior–posterior (A–P) dimension were commonly observed, as well as transverse travelling wave patterns along the A–P dimension, previously not documented in the literature. Acoustic energy was mainly created during the instant of glottal opening. The vestibular folds, when adducted, participated in tissue vibration, effectively increasing the generated sound pressure level by 12 dB. The complexity of the observed phenomena is partly attributed to the distinct laryngeal anatomy of the elephant larynx, which is not simply a large-scale version of its human counterpart. Travelling waves may be facilitated by low fundamental frequencies and increased vocal fold tension. A travelling wave model is proposed, to account for three types of phenomena: A–P travelling waves, ‘conventional’ standing wave patterns, and irregular vocal fold vibration."},{"title":"Indefatigable: an erect coralline alga is highly resistant to fatigue","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3772","abstract":"Intertidal organisms are subjected to intense hydrodynamic forces as waves break on the shore. These repeated insults can cause a plant or animal's structural materials to fatigue and fail, even though no single force would be sufficient to break the organism. Indeed, the survivorship and maximum size of at least one species of seaweed is set by the accumulated effects of small forces rather than the catastrophic imposition of a single lethal force. One might suppose that fatigue would be especially potent in articulated coralline algae, in which the strain of the entire structure is concentrated in localized joints, the genicula. However, previous studies of joint morphology suggest an alternative hypothesis. Each geniculum is composed of a single tier of cells, which are attached at their ends to the calcified segments of the plant (the intergenicula) but have minimal connection to each other along their lengths. This lack of neighborly attachment potentially allows the weak interfaces between cells to act as ‘crack stoppers’, inhibiting the growth of fatigue cracks. We tested this possibility by repeatedly loading fronds of Calliarthron cheilosporioides, a coralline alga common on wave-washed shores in California. When repeatedly loaded to 50–80% of its breaking strength, C. cheilosporioides commonly survives more than a million stress cycles, with a record of 51 million. We show how this extraordinary fatigue resistance interacts with the distribution of wave-induced water velocities to set the limits to size in this species."},{"title":"Sex-specific trade-offs and compensatory mechanisms: bite force and sprint speed pose conflicting demands on the design of geckos (Hemidactylus frenatus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3781","abstract":"One of the more intuitive viability costs that can result from the possession of exaggerated sexually selected traits is increased predation pressure as a result of reduced locomotor capacity. Despite mixed empirical support for such locomotor costs, recent studies suggest that such costs may be masked by compensatory traits that effectively offset any detrimental effects. In this study, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the locomotor costs associated with improved male–male competitive ability by simultaneously testing for locomotor trade-offs and potential compensatory mechanisms in territorial male and non-territorial female geckos. Fighting capacity and escape performance of male Asian house geckos (Hemidactylus frenatus) are likely to pose conflicting demands on the optimum phenotype for each task. Highly territorial and aggressive males may require greater investment in head size/strength but such an enhancement may affect overall escape performance. Among male geckos, we found that greater biting capacity because of larger head size was associated with reduced sprint performance; this trade-off was further exacerbated when sprinting on an incline. Females, however, showed no evidence of this trade-off on either flat or inclined surfaces. The sex specificity of this trade-off suggests that the sexes differ in their optimal strategies for dealing with the conflicting requirements of bite force and sprint speed. Unlike males, female H. frenatus had a positive association between hind-limb length and head size, suggesting that they have utilised a compensatory mechanism to alleviate the possible locomotor costs of larger head sizes. It appears that there is greater selection on traits that improve fighting ability (bite force) for males, but it is viability traits (sprint speed) that appear to be of greater importance for females. Our results emphasise that only by examining both functional trade-offs and potential compensatory mechanisms is it possible to discover the varied mechanisms affecting the morphological design of a species."},{"title":"An automated training paradigm reveals long-term memory in planarians and its persistence through head regeneration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3799","abstract":"Planarian flatworms are a popular system for research into the molecular mechanisms that enable these complex organisms to regenerate their entire body, including the brain. Classical data suggest that they may also be capable of long-term memory. Thus, the planarian system may offer the unique opportunity to study brain regeneration and memory in the same animal. To establish a system for the investigation of the dynamics of memory in a regenerating brain, we developed a computerized training and testing paradigm that avoided the many issues that confounded previous, manual attempts to train planarians. We then used this new system to train flatworms in an environmental familiarization protocol. We show that worms exhibit environmental familiarization, and that this memory persists for at least 14 days – long enough for the brain to regenerate. We further show that trained, decapitated planarians exhibit evidence of memory retrieval in a savings paradigm after regenerating a new head. Our work establishes a foundation for objective, high-throughput assays in this molecularly tractable model system that will shed light on the fundamental interface between body patterning and stored memories. We propose planarians as key emerging model species for mechanistic investigations of the encoding of specific memories in biological tissues. Moreover, this system is lik ely to have important implications for the biomedicine of stem-cell-derived treatments of degenerative brain disorders in human adults."},{"title":"Ammonium secretion by Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster: application of a novel ammonium-selective microelectrode","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3818","abstract":"Ammonia is a toxic nitrogenous waste product of amino acid metabolism that may accumulate to high levels in the medium ingested by larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.

Measurement of NH4+ concentrations in secreted droplets is complicated either by the requirement for large sample volumes for enzymatic assays or by the inadequate selectivity of NH4+-selective microelectrodes based on nonactin. We have developed a novel liquid membrane NH4+-selective microelectrode based on a 19-membered crown compound (TD19C6), which has been used previously in ammonium-selective macroelectrodes. In conjunction with an improved technique for correcting for interference of potassium, NH4+-selective microelectrodes based on TD19C6 permit accurate measurement of ammonium concentration in haemolymph samples and nanolitre droplets of fluid secreted by the Malpighian tubules of D. melanogaster. The results indicate that active secretion of ammonium into the Malpighian tubule lumen is sufficient to maintain concentrations of ~1 mmol l−1 ammonium in the haemolymph of larvae reared on diets containing 100 mmol l−1 ammonium chloride."},{"title":"Impact of temperature on performance in two species of South African dwarf chameleon, Bradypodion pumilum and B. occidentale","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3828","abstract":"Temperature is an extrinsic factor that influences reptile behavior because of its impact on reptile physiology.

Here, we examined the temperature dependence of performance in two species of South African dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion): one adapted to a semi-arid environment and one to a mesic environment. Ecologically relevant performance traits were tested at different temperatures to evaluate their thermal dependence, and temperature–performance breadths for 80% and 90% of each performance trait were calculated. Our results show distinct differences in the thermal dependence of speed- versus force-related performance traits. Moreover, our results show that the semi-arid species is better adapted to higher temperatures and as such has a better chance of coping with the predicted increases in environmental temperature. The mesic area-adapted species seems to be more sensitive to an increase in temperature and could therefore potentially be threatened by the predicted future climate change. However, further studies investigating the potential for acclimation in chameleons are needed to better understand how animals may respond to future climate change."},{"title":"GABAB receptors play an essential role in maintaining sleep during the second half of the night in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3837","abstract":"GABAergic signalling is important for normal sleep in humans and flies. Here we advance the current understanding of GABAergic modulation of daily sleep patterns by focusing on the role of slow metabotropic GABAB receptors in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We asked whether GABAB-R2 receptors are regulatory elements in sleep regulation in addition to the already identified fast ionotropic Rdl GABAA receptors. By immunocytochemical and reporter-based techniques we show that the pigment dispersing factor (PDF)-positive ventrolateral clock neurons (LNv) express GABAB-R2 receptors. Downregulation of GABAB-R2 receptors in the large PDF neurons (l-LNv) by RNAi reduced sleep maintenance in the second half of the night, whereas sleep latency at the beginning of the night that was previously shown to depend on ionotropic Rdl GABAA receptors remained unaltered. Our results confirm the role of the l-LNv neurons as an important part of the sleep circuit in D. melanogaster and also identify the GABAB-R2 receptors as the thus far missing component in GABA-signalling that is essential for sleep maintenance. Despite the significant effects on sleep, we did not observe any changes in circadian behaviour in flies with downregulated GABAB-R2 receptors, indicating that the regulation of sleep maintenance via l-LNv neurons is independent of their function in the circadian clock circuit."},{"title":"Lizard tricks: overcoming conflicting requirements of speed versus climbing ability by altering biomechanics of the lizard stride","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3854","abstract":"Adaptations promoting greater performance in one habitat are thought to reduce performance in others. However, there are many examples of animals in which, despite habitat differences, such predicted differences in performance do not occur. One such example is the relationship between locomotory performance to habitat for varanid lizards. To explain the lack of difference in locomotor performance we examined detailed observations of the kinematics of each lizard's stride. Differences in kinematics were greatest between climbing and non-climbing species. For terrestrial lizards, the kinematics indicated that increased femur adduction, femur rotation and ankle angle all contributed positively to changes in stride length, but they were constrained for climbing species, probably because of biomechanical restrictions on the centre of mass height (to increase stability on vertical surfaces). Despite climbing species having restricted stride length, no differences have been previously reported in sprint speed between climbing and non-climbing varanids. This is best explained by climbing varanids using an alternative speed modulation strategy of varying stride frequency to avoid the potential trade-off of speed versus stability on vertical surfaces. Thus, by measuring the relevant biomechanics for lizard strides, we have shown how kinematic differences among species can mask performance differences typically associated with habitat variation."},{"title":"Gas exchange patterns and water loss rates in the Table Mountain cockroach, Aptera fusca (Blattodea: Blaberidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3844","abstract":"The importance of metabolic rate and/or spiracle modulation for saving respiratory water is contentious.

Percentage of RWL (relative to total water loss) was typically low (9.79±1.84%) and did not differ significantly among gas exchange patterns at 15°C (P=0.26). The method of estimation had a large impact on the percentage of RWL, and of the three techniques investigated (traditional, regression and hyperoxic switch), the traditional method generally performed best.

Colour reversibility has many different functions in animals, such as thermoregulation, crypsis through background matching and social interactions. However, the mechanisms underlying reversible colour changes are yet to be thoroughly investigated. This study aims to determine the environmental and hormonal factors underlying morphological colour changes in Thomisus onustus crab spiders and the biochemical metabolites produced during these changes. We quantified the dynamics of colour changes over time: spiders were kept in yellow and white containers under natural light conditions and their colour was measured over 15 days using a spectrophotometer. We also characterised the chemical metabolites of spiders changing to a yellow colour using HPLC. Hormonal control of colour change was investigated by injecting 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) into spiders. We found that background colouration was a major environmental factor responsible for colour change in crab spiders: individuals presented with white and yellow backgrounds changed to white and yellow colours, respectively. An ommochrome precursor, 3-OH-kynurenine, was the main pigment responsible for yellow colour. Spiders injected with 20E displayed a similar rate of change towards yellow colouration as spiders kept in yellow containers and exposed to natural sunlight. This study demonstrates novel hormonal manipulations that are capable of inducing reversible colour change."},{"title":"Adjustments of global and local hindlimb properties during terrestrial locomotion of the common quail (Coturnix coturnix)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3906","abstract":"Previous research has resulted in increasing insight into neuro-mechanical control strategies during perturbed locomotion. In contrast, more general analyses on simple model (template)-related parameters during avian terrestrial locomotion are still rare. Quail kinematic data obtained using X-ray videography combined with ground reaction force measurements were used as a basis to investigate how ‘global’ template and ‘local’ leg joint parameters in this small, predominantly terrestrial bird change with speed and gait. Globally, quail locomotion approximates a spring-like behavior in all investigated gaits. However, ground reaction forces are more vertically oriented, which may help to balance the trunk. At the joint level, practically all the spring-like work was found to occur in the intertarsal joint (ITJ). From walking to grounded running, the local stiffness of the ITJ decreases similarly to the reduction observed in global leg stiffness. Thus, in gaits without aerial phases the quails may modulate ITJ stiffness to regulate global leg stiffness, and therefore gait changes, to a significant degree. At higher speeds both global leg compression and stiffness are increased (the latter to values not significantly different to those obtained during walking). This enables the animals to shorten contact time and to generate aerial phases (running). However, we did not observe a change in the stiffness in the ITJ with a change of gait from grounded running to running. We hypothesize that a more extended leg at touch-down, controlled by the joint angles in the knee and ITJ, has an important influence in the leg stiffness adjustment process during running."},{"title":"A conserved fertility signal despite population variation in the cuticular chemical profile of the trap-jaw ant Odontomachus brunneus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3917","abstract":"Contact pheromones in the form of cuticular hydrocarbons are widespread among insects. Eusocial insects present a special challenge for understanding the evolution of the cuticular hydrocarbon profile because this blend is responsible for multiple distinct roles such as nestmate recognition and signalling fertility status. This study investigates these two signalling roles of the hydrocarbon profile in the trap-jaw ant Odontomachus brunneus. We demonstrate that the cuticular hydrocarbon profile is highly variable across populations and provide evidence that these differences are used for nestmate discrimination. Through manipulative experiments we also show that (Z)-9-nonacosene (Z9:C29) is used as a fertility signal and its role is conserved across populations. Our data demonstrate that both fertility and nestmate signalling influence the cuticular hydrocarbon profile and specifically the relative abundance of Z9:C29 on the cuticle of O. brunneus. Our study suggests that natural selection works on the cuticular chemical profile through multiple regulatory pathways, diversifying nestmate signals while conserving fertility signals."},{"title":"Uptake, handling and excretion of Na+ and Cl− from the diet in vivo in freshwater- and seawater-acclimated killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, an agastric teleost","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3925","abstract":"A radiotracer approach using diets labelled with 22Na+, 36Cl− and [14C]polyethylene-4000 (PEG-4000) was employed to investigate the role of intestinal uptake from the food in ion homeostasis in the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus. This euryhaline teleost lacks both a stomach and the capacity for Cl− uptake at the gills in freshwater. PEG-4000 appearance in the water was minimal up to 10–11 h post-feeding, indicating the virtual absence of Na+ and Cl− loss in the faeces up until this time. Rapid uptake of dietary Na+ and Cl− occurred and more than 88% of 22Na+ and 36Cl− were absorbed in the intestine by 3 h post-feeding; excretion rates of Na+ and Cl− originating from the food were greatest during this period. Uptake and excretion of Cl− from the diet was fivefold to sixfold greater than that of Na+ in freshwater, and approximately threefold greater in seawater. Excretions of dietary Na+ and Cl− by seawater-acclimated killifish were far greater than by freshwater-acclimated killifish in this time frame, reflecting the much greater branchial efflux rates and turnover rates of the internal exchangeable pools. At both 3 and 9 h post-feeding, the largest fraction of dietary Na+ was found in the carcass of freshwater-acclimated fish, followed by the external water, and finally the digestive tract. However, in seawater-acclimated fish, more was excreted to the water, and less was retained in the carcass. For Cl−, which was taken up and excreted more rapidly than Na+, the majority of the dietary load had moved to the external water by 9 h in both freshwater and seawater animals. After 7 days training on a low-salt natural diet (live Lumbriculus variegatus worms; 31.5 μmol Na+ g−1 wet mass) versus a high-salt synthetic pellet diet (911 μmol Na+ g−1 dry food mass), freshwater killifish exhibited a lower absolute excretion rate of Na+ from the low-salt diet, but relative uptake from the intestine and retention in the carcass were virtually identical from the two diets. Seawater killifish excreted relatively more Na+ from the low-salt diet. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of dietary Na+ and Cl− in the electrolyte economy of the killifish, particularly in freshwater, and especially for Cl−."},{"title":"Cost, effectiveness and environmental relevance of multidrug transporters in sea urchin embryos","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3896","abstract":"ATP-binding cassette transporters protect cells via efflux of xenobiotics and endogenous byproducts of detoxification. While the cost of this ATP-dependent extrusion is known at the molecular level, i.e. the ATP used for each efflux event, the overall cost to a cell or organism of operating this defense is unclear, especially as the cost of efflux changes depending on environmental conditions. During prolonged exposure to xenobiotics, multidrug transporter activity could be costly and ineffective because effluxed substrate molecules are not modified in the process and could thus undergo repeated cycles of efflux and re-entry. Here we use embryos of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, as a model to determine transport costs and benefits under environmentally relevant xenobiotic concentrations. Strikingly, our results show that efflux transporter activity costs less than 0.2% of total ATP usage, as a proportion of oxygen consumption. The benefits of transport, defined as the reduction in substrate accumulation due to transporter activity, depended largely, but not entirely, on the rate of passive flux of each substrate across the plasma membrane. One of the substrates tested exhibited rapid membrane permeation coupled with high rates of efflux, thus inducing rapid and futile cycles of efflux followed by re-entry of the substrate. This combination significantly reduced transporter effectiveness as a defense and increased costs even at relatively low substrate concentrations. Despite these effects with certain substrates, our results show that efflux transporters are a remarkably effective and low-cost first line of defense against exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of xenobiotics."},{"title":"The effect of substrate diameter and incline on locomotion in an arboreal frog","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3599","abstract":"Frogs are characterized by a unique morphology associated with their saltatory lifestyle. Yet, arboreal species show morphological specializations relative to other ecological specialists allowing them to hold on to narrow substrates. However, almost nothing is known about the effects of substrate characteristics on locomotion in frogs. Here, we quantified the 3D kinematics of forelimb movement for frogs moving across branches of different diameters (1 and 40 mm) and two different inclines (horizontal and 45 deg uphill). Our results show that grip types differ while moving across substrates of different diameters and inclines. The kinematics of the wrist, elbow and shoulder as well as the body position relative to the substrate also showed significant effects of individual, diameter and incline. Kinematic differences involved duration, velocity of movement and angular excursions. Differences were most pronounced for the proximal joints of the forelimb and effects for substrate diameter were greater than for incline. Interestingly, the effects of diameter and incline on both grip type and kinematics are similar to what has been observed for lizards and primates, suggesting that the mechanics of narrow substrate locomotion drive the kinematics of movement independent of morphology and phylogeny."},{"title":"Wet webs work better: humidity, supercontraction and the performance of spider orb webs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3606","abstract":"Like many biomaterials, spider silk responds to water through softening and swelling. Major ampullate silk, the main structural element of most prey capture webs, also shrinks dramatically if unrestrained or develops high tension if restrained, a phenomenon called ‘supercontraction’. While supercontraction has been investigated for over 30 years, its consequences for web performance remain controversial. Here, we measured prey capture performance of dry and wet (supercontracted) orb webs of Argiope and Nephila using small wood blocks as prey. Prey capture performance significantly increased at high humidity for Argiope while the improvement was less dramatic for Nephila. This difference is likely due to Argiope silk supercontracting more than Nephila silk. Web deflection, measured as the extension of the web upon prey impact, also increased at high humidity in Argiope, suggesting that silk softening upon supercontraction explains the improved performance of wet webs. These results strongly argue that supercontraction is not detrimental to web performance."},{"title":"Ventilation patterns of the songbird lung/air sac system during different behaviors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3611","abstract":"Unidirectional, continuous airflow through the avian lung is achieved through an elaborate air sac system with a sequential, posterior to anterior ventilation pattern. This classical model was established through various approaches spanning passively ventilated systems to mass spectrometry analysis of tracer gas flow into various air sacs during spontaneous breathing in restrained ducks. Information on flow patterns in other bird taxa is missing, and these techniques do not permit direct tests of whether the basic flow pattern can change during different behaviors. Here we use thermistors implanted into various locations of the respiratory system to detect small pulses of tracer gas (helium) to reconstruct airflow patterns in quietly breathing and behaving (calling, wing flapping) songbirds (zebra finch and yellow-headed blackbird). The results illustrate that the basic pattern of airflow in these two species is largely consistent with the model. However, two notable differences emerged. First, some tracer gas arrived in the anterior set of air sacs during the inspiration during which it was inhaled, suggesting a more rapid throughput through the lung than previously assumed. Second, differences in ventilation between the two anterior air sacs emerged during calling and wing flapping, indicating that adjustments in the flow pattern occur during dynamic behaviors. It is unclear whether this modulation in ventilation pattern is passive or active. This technique for studying ventilation patterns during dynamic behaviors proves useful for establishing detailed timing of airflow and modulation of ventilation in the avian respiratory system."},{"title":"Mechanical tuning of the moth ear: distortion-product otoacoustic emissions and tympanal vibrations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3863","abstract":"The mechanical tuning of the ear in the moth Empyreuma pugione was investigated by distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) and laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV). DPOAE audiograms were assessed using a novel protocol that may be advantageous for non-invasive auditory studies in insects. To evoke DPOAE, two-tone stimuli within frequency and level ranges that generated a large matrix of values (960 frequency–level combinations) were used to examine the acoustic space in which the moth tympanum shows its best mechanical and acoustical responses. The DPOAE tuning curve derived from the response matrix resembles that obtained previously by electrophysiology, and is V-shaped and tuned to frequencies between 25 and 45 kHz with low Q10dB values of 1.21±0.26. In addition, while using a comparable stimulation regime, mechanical distortion in the displacement of the moth's tympanal membrane at the stigma was recorded with a laser Doppler vibrometer. The corresponding mechanical vibration audiograms were compared with DPOAE audiograms. Both types of audiograms have comparable shape, but most of the mechanical response fields are shifted towards lower frequencies. We showed for the first time in moths that DPOAE have a pronounced analogy in the vibration of the tympanic membrane where they may originate. Our work supports previous studies that point to the stigma (and the internally associated transduction machinery) as an important place of sound amplification in the moth ear, but also suggests a complex mechanical role for the rest of the transparent zone."},{"title":"The mechanisms of the widespread production of phosphorylated HSP25 after fatiguing muscle stimulation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3620","abstract":"We previously showed that a widespread heat shock protein (HSP) response to fatigue of a single hindlimb muscle was responsible for a global adaptive response to an acute localized stress. We also demonstrated that the HSP response resulted from the activation of nerve afferents from the stimulated muscle. However, we did not examine the role played by the different muscle afferents or the efferent arm of HSP response. In the present study we measured the changes in phosphorylated HSP25 (pHSP25) levels in resting hindlimb muscles and the diaphragm, kidney and brain in response to a fatiguing stimulation of one tibialis anterior muscle that was repeated in five series of experiments: (1) intact muscle innervation, (2) during the selective procaine block of conduction in group IV muscle afferents, (3) after muscle nerve transection to suppress all the sensory messages, and under pharmacological blockade of the (4) alpha-adrenergic or (5) glutamatergic neurotransmission. The data showed that: (1) the pHSP25 response in hindlimb muscles resulted from the stimulation of both group III and IV muscle afferents while the pHSP25 response in the diaphragm, kidney and brain resulted from the sole activation of the group IV fibres, and (2) the blockade of alpha-adrenergic, but not glutamatergic, neurotransmission suppressed the pHSP25 response in all explored tissues except the brain. The present study highlights the role played by the group III and IV muscle afferents in the fatigue-induced pHSP25 response and shows that the sympathetic nerve supply to the muscles and kidney represents the efferent arm of the pHSP25 activation. However, the pHSP25 changes in the brain cannot be explained by the pathways investigated here."},{"title":"The protective effect of rapid cold-hardening develops more quickly in frozen versus supercooled larvae of the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3937","abstract":"During the austral summer, larvae of the terrestrial midge Belgica antarctica (Diptera: Chironomidae) experience highly variable and often unpredictable thermal conditions. In addition to remaining freeze tolerant year-round, larvae are capable of swiftly increasing their cold tolerance through the rapid cold-hardening (RCH) response. The present study compared the induction of RCH in frozen versus supercooled larvae. At the same induction temperature, RCH occurred more rapidly and conferred a greater level of cryoprotection in frozen versus supercooled larvae. Furthermore, RCH in frozen larvae could be induced at temperatures as low as −12°C, which is the lowest temperature reported to induce RCH. Remarkably, as little as 15 min at −5°C significantly enhanced larval cold tolerance. Not only is protection from RCH acquired swiftly, but it is also quickly lost after thawing for 2 h at 2°C. Because the primary difference between frozen and supercooled larvae is cellular dehydration caused by freeze concentration of body fluids, we also compared the effects of acclimation in dehydrated versus frozen larvae. Because slow dehydration without chilling significantly increased larval survival to a subsequent cold exposure, we hypothesize that cellular dehydration caused by freeze concentration promotes the rapid acquisition of cold tolerance in frozen larvae."},{"title":"Differential expression and novel permeability properties of three aquaporin 8 paralogs from seawater-challenged Atlantic salmon smolts","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/20/3873","abstract":"Aquaporins may facilitate transepithelial water absorption in the intestine of seawater (SW)-acclimated fish. Here we have characterized three full-length aqp8 paralogs from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Bayesian inference revealed that each paralog is a representative of the three major classes of aqp8aa, aqp8ab and aqp8b genes found in other teleosts. The permeability properties were studied by heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the expression levels examined by qPCR, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, and immunoblotting of membrane fractions from intestines of SW-challenged smolts. All three Aqp8 paralogs were permeable to water and urea, whereas Aqp8ab and -8b were, surprisingly, also permeable to glycerol. The mRNA tissue distribution of each paralog was distinct, although some tissues such as the intestine showed redundant expression of more than one paralog. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized Aqp8aa(1+2) to intracellular compartments of the liver and intestine, and Aqp8ab and Aqp8b to apical plasma membrane domains of the intestinal epithelium, with Aqp8b also in goblet cells. In a control experiment with rainbow trout, immunoelectron microscopy confirmed abundant labeling of Aqp8ab and -8b at apical plasma membranes of enterocytes in the middle intestine and also in subapical vesicular structures. During SW challenge, Aqp8ab showed significantly increased levels of protein expression in plasma-membrane-enriched fractions of the intestine. These data indicate that the Atlantic salmon Aqp8 paralogs have neofunctionalized on a transcriptional as well as a functional level, and that Aqp8ab may play a central role in the intestinal transcellular uptake of water during SW acclimation."},{"title":"Economic design in a long-distance migrating molluscivore: how fast-fuelling red knots in Bohai Bay, China, get away with small gizzards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3627","abstract":"We carried out an observational and experimental study to decipher how resource characteristics, in interaction with the predator's phenotype, constrain a fitness-determining performance measure, i.e. refuelling in a migrant bird. Two subspecies of red knot (Calidris canutus rogersi and C. c. piersmai) use northern Bohai Bay, Yellow Sea, China, for the final prebreeding stopover, during their 10,000–15,000 km long migrations between wintering and breeding areas. Here, they feed on small bivalves, especially 2–7 mm long Potamocorbula laevis. With an average stay of 29 days, and the need to store 80 g of fat for the onward flights to high-Arctic breeding grounds, red knots need to refuel fast. Using existing knowledge, we expected them to achieve this on the basis of (1) prey with high flesh to shell mass ratios, (2) large gizzards to crush the ingested molluscs, or (3) a combination of the two. Rejecting all three predictions, we found that red knots staging in Bohai Bay had the smallest gizzards on record (4.9±0.8 g, mean ± s.e.m., N=27), and also found that prey quality of P. laevis is much lower than predicted for the measured gizzard size (i.e. 1.3 rather than the predicted 4.5 kJ g−1 dry shell mass, DMshell). The estimated handling time of P. laevis (0.2 s) is much shorter than the observed time between two prey ingestions (0.7 s), indicating that prey handling time is no constraint. Based on field observations of dropping rates and on indoor digestion trails, the shell processing rate was estimated at 3.9 mg DMshell s−1, i.e. three times higher the rate previously predicted for red knots eating as fast as they can with the measured gizzard size. This is explained by the small and easily crushed P. laevis enabling high processing rates. As P. laevis also occurred in high densities, the metabolizable energy intake rate of red knots with small gizzards at 5 J s−1 was as high as at northward staging sites elsewhere in the world. Currently, therefore, food characteristics in Bohai Bay are such that red knots can refuel fast whilst economizing on the size of their gizzard. These time-stressed migrants thus provide an elegant example of symmorphosis."},{"title":"Expression analysis of the speech-related genes FoxP1 and FoxP2 and their relation to singing behavior in two songbird species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3682","abstract":"Humans and songbirds are among the rare animal groups that exhibit socially learned vocalizations: speech and song, respectively. These vocal-learning capacities share a reliance on audition and cortico-basal ganglia circuitry, as well as neurogenetic mechanisms. Notably, the transcription factors Forkhead box proteins 1 and 2 (FoxP1, FoxP2) exhibit similar expression patterns in the cortex and basal ganglia of humans and the zebra finch species of songbird, among other brain regions. Mutations in either gene are associated with language disorders in humans. Experimental knock-down of FoxP2 in the basal ganglia song control region Area X during song development leads to imprecise copying of tutor songs. Moreover, FoxP2 levels decrease naturally within Area X when zebra finches sing. Here, we examined neural expression patterns of FoxP1 and FoxP2 mRNA in adult Bengalese finches, a songbird species whose songs exhibit greater sequence complexity and increased reliance on audition for maintaining their quality. We found that FoxP1 and FoxP2 expression in Bengalese finches is similar to that in zebra finches, including strong mRNA signals for both factors in multiple song control nuclei and enhancement of FoxP1 in these regions relative to surrounding brain tissue. As with zebra finches, when Bengalese finches sing, FoxP2 is behaviorally downregulated within basal ganglia Area X over a similar time course, and expression negatively correlates with the amount of singing. This study confirms that in multiple songbird species, FoxP1 expression highlights song control regions, and regulation of FoxP2 is associated with motor control of song."},{"title":"Tissue-specific ionomotive enzyme activity and K+ reabsorption reveal the rectum as an important ionoregulatory organ in larval Chironomus riparius exposed to varying salinity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3637","abstract":"A role for the rectum in the ionoregulatory homeostasis of larval Chironomus riparius was revealed by rearing animals in different saline environments and examining: (1) the spatial distribution and activity of keystone ionomotive enzymes Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA) and V-type H+-ATPase (VA) in the alimentary canal, and (2) rectal K+ transport with the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET). NKA and VA activity were measured in four distinct regions of the alimentary canal as follows: the combined foregut and anterior midgut, the posterior midgut, the Malpighian tubules and the hindgut. Both enzymes exhibited 10–20 times greater activity in the hindgut relative to all other areas. When larvae were reared in either ion-poor water (IPW) or freshwater (FW), no significant difference in hindgut enzyme activity was observed. However, in larvae reared in brackish water (BW), NKA and VA activity in the hindgut significantly decreased. Immunolocalization of NKA and VA in the hindgut revealed that the bulk of protein was located in the rectum. Therefore, K+ transport across the rectum was examined using SIET. Measurement of K+ flux along the rectum revealed a net K+ reabsorption that was reduced fourfold in BW-reared larvae versus larvae reared in FW or IPW. Inhibition of NKA with ouabain, VA with bafilomycin and K+ channels with charybdotoxin diminished rectal K+ reabsorption in FW- and IPW-reared larvae, but not BW-reared larvae.

The present study teases apart the geometric components within the traditionally used rectangular enclosure and finds that zebrafish selectively represent distance and directional relationships between extended boundary surfaces. Similar behavioural results in geometric navigation tasks with human children provide prima facie evidence for similar underlying cognitive computations and open new doors for probing the genetic foundations that give rise to these computations."},{"title":"The gene vitellogenin affects microRNA regulation in honey bee (Apis mellifera) fat body and brain","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3724","abstract":"In honey bees, vitellogenin (Vg) is hypothesized to be a major factor affecting hormone signaling, food-related behavior, immunity, stress resistance and lifespan.

The actions of microRNAs and Vg are known to intersect in the context of reproduction; however, the role of these associations on social behavior is unknown. The phenotypic effects of Vg knockdown are best established and studied in the forager stage of workers. Thus, we exploited the well-established RNA interference (RNAi) protocol for Vg knockdown to investigate its downstream effects on microRNA population in honey bee foragers' brain and fat body tissue. To identify microRNAs that are differentially expressed between tissues in control and knockdown foragers, we used μParaflo microfluidic oligonucleotide microRNA microarrays. Our results showed that 76 and 74 microRNAs were expressed in the brain of control and knockdown foragers whereas 66 and 69 microRNAs were expressed in the fat body of control and knockdown foragers, respectively. Target prediction identified potential seed matches for a differentially expressed subset of microRNAs affected by Vg knockdown. These candidate genes are involved in a broad range of biological processes including insulin signaling, juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroid signaling previously shown to affect foraging behavior. Thus, here we demonstrate a causal link between the Vg knockdown forager phenotype and variation in the abundance of microRNAs in different tissues, with possible consequences for the regulation of foraging behavior."},{"title":"Dynamic biophotonics: female squid exhibit sexually dimorphic tunable leucophores and iridocytes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3733","abstract":"Loliginid squid use tunable multilayer reflectors to modulate the optical properties of their skin for camouflage and communication. Contained inside specialized cells called iridocytes, these photonic structures have been a model for investigations into bio-inspired adaptive optics. Here, we describe two distinct sexually dimorphic tunable biophotonic features in the commercially important species Doryteuthis opalescens: bright stripes of rainbow iridescence on the mantle just beneath each fin attachment and a bright white stripe centered on the dorsal surface of the mantle between the fins. Both of these cellular features are unique to the female; positioned in the same location as the conspicuously bright white testis in the male, they are completely switchable, transitioning between transparency and high reflectivity. The sexual dimorphism, location and tunability of these features suggest that they may function in mating or reproduction. These features provide advantageous new models for investigation of adaptive biophotonics. The intensely reflective cells of the iridescent stripes provide a greater signal-to-noise ratio than the adaptive iridocytes studied thus far, while the cells constituting the white stripe are adaptive leucophores – unique biological tunable broadband scatterers containing Mie-scattering organelles activated by acetylcholine, and a unique complement of reflectin proteins."},{"title":"A three-dimensional musculoskeletal model of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) pelvis and hind limb","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3709","abstract":"Musculoskeletal models have become important tools for studying a range of muscle-driven movements. However, most work has been in modern humans, with few applications in other species. Chimpanzees are facultative bipeds and our closest living relatives, and have provided numerous important insights into our own evolution. A chimpanzee musculoskeletal model would allow integration across a wide range of laboratory-based experimental data, providing new insights into the determinants of their locomotor performance capabilities, as well as the origins and evolution of human bipedalism. Here, we described a detailed three-dimensional (3D) musculoskeletal model of the chimpanzee pelvis and hind limb. The model includes geometric representations of bones and joints, as well as 35 muscle–tendon units that were represented using 44 Hill-type muscle models. Muscle architecture data, such as muscle masses, fascicle lengths and pennation angles, were drawn from literature sources. The model permits calculation of 3D muscle moment arms, muscle–tendon lengths and isometric muscle forces over a wide range of joint positions. Muscle–tendon moment arms predicted by the model were generally in good agreement with tendon-excursion estimates from cadaveric specimens. Sensitivity analyses provided information on the parameters that model predictions are most and least sensitive to, which offers important context for interpreting future results obtained with the model. Comparisons with a similar human musculoskeletal model indicate that chimpanzees are better suited for force production over a larger range of joint positions than humans. This study represents an important step in understanding the integrated function of the neuromusculoskeletal systems in chimpanzee locomotion."},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake. XX. Body temperatures and physical activity of female mice during lactation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3751","abstract":"Lactating animals consume greater amounts of food than non-reproductive animals, but energy intake appears to be limited in late lactation. The heat dissipation limit theory suggests that the food intake of lactating mice is limited by the capacity of the mother to dissipate heat. Lactating mice should therefore have high body temperatures (Tb), and changes in energy intake during lactation should be reflected by variation in Tb. To investigate these predictions, 26 mice (Mus musculus) were monitored daily throughout lactation for food intake, body mass, litter size and litter mass. After weaning, 21 days postpartum, maternal food intake and body mass were monitored for another 10 days. Maternal activity and Tb were recorded every minute for 23 h a day using implanted transmitters (vital view). Energy intake increased to a plateau in late lactation (days 13–17). Daily gain in pup mass declined during this same period, suggesting a limit on maternal energy intake. Litter size and litter mass were positively related to maternal energy intake and body mass. Activity levels were constantly low, and mice with the largest increase in energy intake at peak lactation had the lowest activity. Tb rose sharply after parturition and the circadian rhythm became compressed within a small range. Tb during the light period increased considerably (1.1°C higher than in baseline), and lactating mice faced chronic hyperthermia, despite their activity levels in lactation being approximately halved. Average Tb increased in relation to energy intake as lactation progressed, but there was no relationship between litter size or litter mass and the mean Tb at peak lactation. These data are consistent with the heat dissipation limit theory, which suggests performance in late lactation is constrained by the ability to dissipate body heat."},{"title":"Muscle growth in teleost fish is regulated by factors utilizing the activin II B receptor","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3742","abstract":"The activin type IIB receptor (Acvr2b) is the cell surface receptor for multiple transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily ligands, several of which regulate muscle growth in mammals. To investigate the role of the Acvr2b signaling pathway in the growth and development of skeletal muscle in teleost fish, transgenic rainbow trout (RBT; Oncorhynchus mykiss) expressing a truncated form of the acvr2b-2a (acvr2b▵) in muscle tissue were produced. High levels of acvr2b▵ expression were detected in the majority of P1 transgenic fish. Transgenic P1 trout developed enhanced, localized musculature in both the epaxial and hypaxial regions (dubbed ‘six pack’). The F1 transgenic offspring did not exhibit localized muscle growth, but rather developed a uniform body morphology with greater girth, condition factor and increased muscle fiber hypertrophy. There was a high degree of variation in the mass of both P1 and F1 transgenic fish, with several fish of each generation exhibiting enhanced growth compared with other transgenic and control siblings. The ‘six pack’ phenotype observed in P1 transgenic RBT overexpressing acvr2b▵ and the presence of F1 individuals with altered muscle morphology provides compelling evidence for the importance of TGF-β signaling molecules in regulating muscle growth in teleost fish."},{"title":"Experimental infection dynamics: using immunosuppression and in vivo parasite tracking to understand host resistance in an amphibian–trematode system","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3700","abstract":"Although naturally occurring hosts often exhibit pronounced differences in infection and pathology, the relative importance of factors associated with host life history and immunity in explaining such patterns often remains speculative. Research in eco-immunology highlights the trade-offs between host physiology and immunity, for which natural variations in disease susceptibility offer a valuable platform to test predictions within this framework. Here, we combined use of a novel, in vivo assay for tracking parasite fate and an experimental manipulation of host immune function (via chronic corticosterone exposure) to assess the role of host immunity in regulating susceptibility of amphibian hosts to three larval trematodes: Ribeiroia ondatrae, Echinostoma trivolvis and Alaria sp. 2. Results from the in vivo parasite-tracking assay revealed marked differences in initial parasite penetration and subsequent host clearance. Relative to infections in a highly susceptible species (Pseudacris regilla), the virulent trematode R. ondatrae was ~25% less successful at penetrating larvae of three hylid frog species and was cleared >45× faster, such that all parasites were rapidly cleared from hylid hosts over 72 h following a Weibull distribution. Immune suppression of Hyla versicolor sharply reduced this resistance and increased infection of all three trematodes by 67 to 190%, with particularly strong increases for R. ondatrae. Diminished resistance correlated with a 62% decrease in circulating eosinophils. Correspondingly, 10 days after corticosterone exposures ended, infections declined dramatically while eosinophil levels returned to normal. In light of ongoing declines and deformities in amphibian populations, these findings have application potential for mitigating disease-driven effects."},{"title":"Effect of nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria on protease inhibitor production and fitness of Daphnia magna","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3649","abstract":"Herbivore–plant interactions have been well studied in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as they are crucial for the trophic transfer of energy and matter. In nutrient-rich freshwater ecosystems, the interaction between primary producers and herbivores is to a large extent represented by Daphnia and cyanobacteria. The occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes and ponds has, at least partly, been attributed to cyanotoxins, which negatively affect the major grazer of planktonic cyanobacteria, i.e. Daphnia. Among these cyanotoxins are the widespread protease inhibitors. These inhibitors have been shown (both in vitro and in situ) to inhibit the most important group of digestive proteases in the gut of Daphnia, i.e. trypsins and chymotrypsins, and to reduce Daphnia growth. In this study we grew cultures of the cyanobacterium Microcystis sp. strain BM25 on nutrient-replete, N-depleted or P-depleted medium. We identified three different micropeptins to be the cause for the inhibitory activity of BM25 against chymotrypsins. The micropeptin content depended on nutrient availability: whereas N limitation led to a lower concentration of micropeptins per biomass, P limitation resulted in a higher production of these chymotrypsin inhibitors. The altered micropeptin content of BM25 was accompanied by changed effects on the fitness of Daphnia magna: a higher content of micropeptins led to lower IC50 values for D. magna gut proteases and vice versa. Following expectations, the lower micropeptin content in the N-depleted BM25 caused higher somatic growth of D. magna. Therefore, protease inhibitors can be regarded as a nutrient-dependent defence against grazers. Interestingly, although the P limitation of the cyanobacterium led to a higher micropeptin content, high growth of D. magna was observed when they were fed with P-depleted BM25. This might be due to reduced digestibility of P-depleted cells with putatively thick mucilaginous sheaths. These findings indicate that both the grazer and the cyanobacterium benefit from P reduction in terms of digestibility and growth inhibition, which is an interesting starting point for further studies."},{"title":"Social descent with territory loss causes rapid behavioral, endocrine and transcriptional changes in the brain","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3656","abstract":"In social species that form hierarchies where only dominant males reproduce, lower-ranking individuals may challenge higher-ranking ones, often resulting in changes in relative social status. How does a losing animal respond to loss of status? Here, using the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, we manipulated the social environment, causing males to descend in rank, and then examined changes in behavior, circulating steroids and immediate early gene (IEG) expression (cfos, egr-1) in micro-dissected brain regions as a proxy for neuronal activation. In particular, we examined changes in the conserved ‘social behavior network’ (SBN), a collection of brain nuclei known to regulate social behaviors across vertebrates. Astatotilapia burtoni has rapidly reversible dominant–subordinate male phenotypes, so that within minutes, descending males lost their bright body coloration, switched to submissive behaviors and expressed higher plasma cortisol levels compared with non-descending and control males. Descending males had higher IEG expression throughout the SBN, but each brain region showed a distinct IEG-specific response in either cfos or egr-1 levels, but not both. Overall, SBN IEG patterns in descending males were distinctly different from the pattern observed in males ascending (subordinate to dominant) in social status. These results reveal that the SBN rapidly coordinates the perception of social cues about status that are of opposite valence, and translates them into appropriate phenotypic changes. This shows for the first time in a non-mammalian vertebrate that dropping in social rank rapidly activates specific socially relevant brain nuclei in a pattern that differs from when males rise to a higher status position."},{"title":"Physiological and behavioural effects of fruit toxins on seed-predating versus seed-dispersing congeneric rodents","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3667","abstract":"Fleshy, ripe fruits attract seed dispersers but also seed predators. Although many fruit consumers (legitimate seed dispersers as well as seed predators) are clearly exposed to plant secondary compounds (PSCs), their impact on the consumers' physiology and foraging behaviour has been largely overlooked. Here, we document the divergent behavioural and physiological responses to fruit consumption of three congeneric rodent species in the Middle East, representing both seed dispersers and seed predators. The fruit pulp of the desert plant Ochradenus baccatus contains high concentrations of glucosinolates (GLSs). These GLSs are hydrolyzed into active toxic compounds upon contact with the myrosinase enzyme released from seeds crushed during fruit consumption. Acomys russatus and A. cahirinus share a desert habitat. Acomys russatus acts as an O. baccatus seed predator, and A. cahirinus circumvents the activation of the GLSs by orally expelling vital seeds. We found that between the three species examined, A. russatus was physiologically most tolerant to whole fruit consumption and even A. minous, which is evolutionarily naïve to O. baccatus, exhibits greater tolerance to whole fruit consumption than A. cahirinus. However, like A. cahirinus, A. minous may also behaviourally avoid the activation of the GLSs by making a hole in the pulp and consuming only the seeds. Our findings demonstrate that seed predators have a higher physiological tolerance than seed dispersers when consuming fruits containing toxic PSCs. The findings also demonstrate the extreme ecological/evolutionary lability of this plant–animal symbiosis to shift from predation to mutualism and vice versa."},{"title":"Homing abilities of the Australian intertidal ant Polyrhachis sokolova","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/19/3674","abstract":"The pressure of returning to and locating the nest after a successful foraging trip is immense in ants. To find their way back home, ants use a number of different strategies (e.g. path integration, trail following) and rely on a range of cues (e.g. pattern of polarised skylight, landmark panorama) available in their environment. How ants weigh different cues has been a question of great interest and has primarily been addressed in the desert ants from Africa and Australia. We here identify the navigational abilities of an intertidal ant, Polyrhachis sokolova, that lives on mudflats where nests and foraging areas are frequently inundated with tidal water. We find that these solitary foraging ants rely heavily on visual landmark information for navigation, but they are also capable of path integration. By displacing ants with and without vector information at different locations within the local familiar territory, we created conflicts between information from the landmarks and information from the path integrator. The homing success of full-vector ants, compared with the zero-vector ants, when displaced 5 m behind the feeder, indicate that vector information had to be coupled with landmark information for successful homing. To explain the differences in the homing abilities of ants from different locations we determined the navigational information content at each release station and compared it with that available at the feeder location. We report here the interaction of multiple navigation strategies in the context of the information content in the environment."},{"title":"The evolution of active vibrissal sensing in mammals: evidence from vibrissal musculature and function in the marsupial opossum Monodelphis domestica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3483","abstract":"Facial vibrissae, or whiskers, are found in nearly all extant mammal species and are likely to have been present in early mammalian ancestors. A sub-set of modern mammals, including many rodents, move their long mystacial whiskers back and forth at high speed whilst exploring in a behaviour known as ‘whisking’. It is not known whether the vibrissae of early mammals moved in this way. The grey short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica, is considered a useful species from the perspective of tracing the evolution of modern mammals. Interestingly, these marsupials engage in whisking bouts similar to those seen in rodents. To better assess the likelihood that active vibrissal sensing was present in ancestral mammals, we examined the vibrissal musculature of the opossum using digital miscroscopy to see whether this resembles that of rodents. Although opossums have fewer whiskers than rats, our investigation found that they have a similar vibrissal musculature. In particular, in both rats and opossums, the musculature includes both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles with the intrinsic muscles positioned as slings linking pairs of large vibrissae within rows. We identified some differences in the extrinsic musculature which, interestingly, matched with behavioural data obtained through high-speed video recording, and indicated additional degrees of freedom for positioning the vibrissae in rats. These data show that the whisker movements of opossum and rat exploit similar underlying mechanisms. Paired with earlier results suggesting similar patterns of vibrissal movement, this strongly implies that early therian (marsupial and placental) mammals were whisking animals that actively controlled their vibrissae."},{"title":"Auditory sensitivity of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) measured using a behavioral prepulse inhibition assay","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3504","abstract":"Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have become a valuable model for investigating the molecular genetics and development of the inner ear in vertebrates. In this study, we employed a prepulse inhibition (PPI) paradigm to assess hearing in larval wild-type (AB) zebrafish during early development at 5–6 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.). We measured the PPI of the acoustic startle response in zebrafish using a 1-dimensional shaker that simulated the particle motion component of sound along the fish's dorsoventral axis. The thresholds to startle-inducing stimuli were determined in 5–6 d.p.f. zebrafish, and their hearing sensitivity was then characterized using the thresholds of prepulse tone stimuli (90–1200 Hz) that inhibited the acoustic startle response to a reliable startle stimulus (820 Hz at 20 dB re. 1 m s−2). Hearing thresholds were defined as the minimum prepulse tone level required to significantly reduce the startle response probability compared with the baseline (no-prepulse) condition. Larval zebrafish showed greatest auditory sensitivity from 90 to 310 Hz with corresponding mean thresholds of −19 to −10 dB re. 1 m s−2, respectively. Hearing thresholds of prepulse tones were considerably lower than previously predicted by startle response assays. The PPI assay was also used to investigate the relative contribution of the lateral line to the detection of acoustic stimuli. After aminoglycoside-induced neuromast hair-cell ablation, we found no difference in PPI thresholds between treated and control fish. We propose that this PPI assay can be used to screen for novel zebrafish hearing mutants and to investigate the ontogeny of hearing in zebrafish and other fishes."},{"title":"Thyroid hormone regulates muscle function during cold acclimation in zebrafish (Danio rerio)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3514","abstract":"Thyroid hormone (TH) is a universal regulator of growth, development and metabolism during cold exposure in mammals. In zebrafish (Danio rerio), TH regulates locomotor performance and metabolism during cold acclimation. The influence of TH on locomotor performance may be via its effect on metabolism or, as has been shown in mammals, by modulating muscle phenotypes. Our aim was to determine whether TH influences muscle phenotypes in zebrafish, and whether this could explain changes in swimming capacity in response to thermal acclimation. We used propylthiouracil and iopanoic acid to induce hypothyroidism in zebrafish over a 3-week acclimation period to either 18 or 28°C. To verify that physiological changes following hypothyroid treatment were in fact due to the action of TH, we supplemented hypothyroid fish with 3,5-diiodothryronine (T2) or 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3). Cold-acclimated fish had significantly greater sustained swimming performance (Ucrit) but not burst speed. Greater Ucrit was accompanied by increased tail beat frequency, but there was no change in tail beat amplitude. Hypothyroidism significantly decreased Ucrit and burst performance, as well as tail beat frequency and SERCA activity in cold-acclimated fish. However, myofibrillar ATPase activity increased in cold-acclimated hypothyroid fish. Hypothyroid treatment also decreased mRNA concentrations of myosin heavy chain fast isoforms and SERCA 1 isoform in cold-acclimated fish. SERCA 1 mRNA increased in warm-acclimated hypothyroid fish, and SERCA 3 mRNA decreased in both cold- and warm-acclimated hypothyroid fish. Supplementation with either T2 or T3 restored Ucrit, burst speed, tail beat frequency, SERCA activity and myosin heavy chain and SERCA 1 and 3 mRNA levels of hypothyroid fish back to control levels. We show that in addition to regulating development and metabolism in vertebrates, TH also regulates muscle physiology in ways that affect locomotor performance in fish. We suggest that the role of TH in modulating SERCA1 expression during cold exposure may have predisposed it to regulate endothermic thermogenesis."},{"title":"Superficial neuromasts facilitate non-visual feeding by larval striped bass (Morone saxatilis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3522","abstract":"To investigate whether mechanoreception is used in non-visual feeding in larval striped bass (Morone saxatilis), the ontogeny of superficial neuromasts along the lateral line was described using the vital stain FM1-43FX and fluorescent microscopy. The number of neuromasts visible along one flank increased from 11 at first feeding [5 to 7 days post-hatch (dph)] to >150 by the juvenile stage (27 dph). A neomycin dose response (0, 1, 2 and 5 mmol l−1) was evaluated for neuromast ablation of bass aged 10, 13, 17 and 20 dph. Using these same age groups, the ability of bass to catch Artemia salina prey in both dark and light tank-based feeding trials was compared between larvae with neuromasts ablated using neomycin (5 mmol l−1) and controls. Neomycin significantly reduced the incidence of feeding in the light and dark. Among larvae that fed, those in the dark treated with neomycin caught fewer Artemia (~5 prey h−1; P<0.05) than controls (16 prey h−1 at 10 dph; 72 prey h−1 at 20 dph). In the light, by contrast, neomycin treatment had no significant effect on prey capture by larvae age 13 to 20 dph, but did inhibit feeding of 10 dph larvae. Verification that neomycin was specifically ablating the hair cells of superficial neuromasts and not affecting either neuromast innervation, olfactory pits, or taste cells was achieved by a combination of staining with FM1-43FX and immunocytochemistry for tubulin and the calcium binding proteins, S100 and calretinin."},{"title":"Changes in the expression and current of the Na+/K+ pump in the snail nervous system after exposure to a static magnetic field","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3531","abstract":"Compelling evidence supports the use of a moderate static magnetic field (SMF) for therapeutic purposes. In order to provide insight into the mechanisms underlying SMF treatment, it is essential to examine the cellular responses elicited by therapeutically applied SMF, especially in the nervous system. The Na+/K+ pump, by creating and maintaining the gradient of Na+ and K+ ions across the plasma membrane, regulates the physiological properties of neurons. In this study, we examined the expression of the Na+/K+ pump in the isolated brain–subesophageal ganglion complex of the garden snail Helix pomatia, along with the immunoreactivity and current of the Na+/K+ pump in isolated snail neurons after 15 min exposure to a moderate (10 mT) SMF. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that 10 mT SMF did not significantly change the expression of the Na+/K+ pump α-subunit in the snail brain and the neuronal cell body. However, our immunofluorescence data showed that SMF treatment induced a significant increase in the Na+/K+ pump α-subunit expression in the neuronal plasma membrane area. This change in Na+/K+ pump expression was reflected in pump activity as demonstrated by the pump current measurements. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from isolated snail neurons revealed that Na+/K+ pump current density was significantly increased after the 10 mT SMF treatment. The SMF-induced increase was different in the two groups of control snail neurons, as defined by the pump current level. The results obtained could represent a physiologically important response of neurons to 10 mT SMF comparable in strength to therapeutic applications."},{"title":"Development of vocalization and hearing in American mink (Neovison vison)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3542","abstract":"American mink (Neovison vison) kits are born altricial and fully dependent on maternal care, for which the kits' vocalizations appear essential. We used auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to determine: (1) hearing sensitivity of adult females from two breeding lines known to differ in maternal behaviour and (2) development of hearing in kits 8–52 days of age. We also studied sound production in 20 kits throughout postnatal days 1 to 44. Adult female mink had a broad hearing range from 1 kHz to above 70 kHz, with peak sensitivity (threshold of 20 dB SPL) at 8–10 kHz, and no difference in sensitivity between the two breeding lines (P>0.22) to explain the difference in maternal care. Mink kits showed no signs of hearing up to postnatal day 24. From day 30, all kits had ABRs indicative of hearing. Hearing sensitivity increased with age, but was still below the adult level at postnatal day 52. When separated from their mothers, kits vocalized loudly. Until the age of 22 days, 90% of all kits vocalized with no significant decline with age (P=0.27). From day 25, concurrent with the start of hearing, the number of vocalizing kits decreased with age (P<0.001), in particular in kits that were re-tested (P=0.004). Large numbers of mink are kept in fur industry farms, and our results are important to the understanding of sound communication, which is part of their natural behaviour. Our results also suggest mink as an interesting model for studying the development of mammalian hearing and its correlation to sound production."},{"title":"Mechanical performance of spider orb webs is tuned for high-speed prey","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3388","abstract":"Spiders in the Orbiculariae spin orb webs that dissipate the mechanical energy of their flying prey, bringing the insects to rest and retaining them long enough for the spider to attack and subdue their meals. Small prey are easily stopped by webs but provide little energetic gain. While larger prey offer substantial nourishment, they are also challenging to capture and can damage the web if they escape. We therefore hypothesized that spider orb webs exhibit properties that improve their probability of stopping larger insects while minimizing damage when the mechanical energy of those prey exceeds the web's capacity. Large insects are typically both heavier and faster flying than smaller prey, but speed plays a disproportionate role in determining total kinetic energy, so we predicted that orb webs may dissipate energy more effectively under faster impacts, independent of kinetic energy per se. We used high-speed video to visualize the impact of wooden pellets fired into orb webs to simulate prey strikes and tested how capture probability varied as a function of pellet size and speed. Capture probability was virtually nil above speeds of ~3 m s−1. However, successful captures do not directly measure the maximum possible energy dissipation by orb webs because these events include lower-energy impacts that may not significantly challenge orb web performance. Therefore, we also compared the total kinetic energy removed from projectiles that escaped orb webs by breaking through the silk, asking whether more energy was removed at faster speeds. Over a range of speeds relevant to insect flight, the amount of energy absorbed by orb webs increases with the speed of prey (i.e. the rates at which webs are stretched). Orb webs therefore respond to faster – and hence higher kinetic energy – prey with better performance, suggesting adaptation to capture larger and faster flying insect prey. This speed-dependent toughness of a complex structure suggests the utility of the intrinsic toughness of spider silk and/or features of the macro-design of webs for high-velocity industrial or military applications, such as ballistic energy absorption."},{"title":"Force balance in the take-off of a pierid butterfly: relative importance and timing of leg impulsion and aerodynamic forces","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3551","abstract":"Up to now, the take-off stage has remained an elusive phase of insect flight that was relatively poorly explored compared with other maneuvers. An overall assessment of the different mechanisms involved in force production during take-off has never been explored. Focusing on the first downstroke, we have addressed this problem from a force balance perspective in butterflies taking off from the ground. In order to determine whether the sole aerodynamic wing force could explain the observed motion of the insect, we have firstly compared a simple analytical model of the wing force with the acceleration of the insect's center of mass estimated from video tracking of the wing and body motions. Secondly, wing kinematics were also used for numerical simulations of the aerodynamic flow field. Similar wing aerodynamic forces were obtained by the two methods. However, neither are sufficient, nor is the inclusion of the ground effect, to predict faithfully the body acceleration. We have to resort to the leg forces to obtain a model that best fits the data. We show that the median and hind legs display an active extension responsible for the initiation of the upward motion of the insect's body, occurring before the onset of the wing downstroke. We estimate that legs generate, at various times, an upward force that can be much larger than all other forces applied to the insect's body. The relative timing of leg and wing forces explains the large variability of trajectories observed during the maneuvers."},{"title":"Hummingbird feather sounds are produced by aeroelastic flutter, not vortex-induced vibration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3395","abstract":"Males in the ‘bee’ hummingbird clade produce distinctive, species-specific sounds with fluttering tail feathers during courtship displays. Flutter may be the result of vortex shedding or aeroelastic interactions. We investigated the underlying mechanics of flutter and sound production of a series of different feathers in a wind tunnel. All feathers tested were capable of fluttering at frequencies varying from 0.3 to 10 kHz. At low airspeeds (Uair) feather flutter was highly damped, but at a threshold airspeed (U*) the feathers abruptly entered a limit-cycle vibration and produced sound. Loudness increased with airspeed in most but not all feathers. Reduced frequency of flutter varied by an order of magnitude, and declined with increasing Uair in all feathers. This, along with the presence of strong harmonics, multiple modes of flutter and several other non-linear effects indicates that flutter is not simply a vortex-induced vibration, and that the accompanying sounds are not vortex whistles. Flutter is instead aeroelastic, in which structural (inertial/elastic) properties of the feather interact variably with aerodynamic forces, producing diverse acoustic results."},{"title":"Effects of intraspecific variation in reproductive traits, pectoral fin use and burst swimming on metabolic rates and swimming performance in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3564","abstract":"There is considerable intraspecific variation in metabolic rates and locomotor performance in aquatic ectothermic vertebrates; however, the mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Using pregnant Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), a live-bearing teleost, we examined the effects of reproductive traits, pectoral fin use and burst-assisted swimming on swimming metabolic rate, standard metabolic rate (ṀO2std) and prolonged swimming performance (Ucrit). Reproductive traits included reproductive allocation and pregnancy stage, the former defined as the mass of the reproductive tissues divided by the total body mass. Results showed that the metabolic rate increased curvilinearly with swimming speed. The slope of the relationship was used as an index of swimming cost. There was no evidence that reproductive traits correlated with swimming cost, ṀO2std or Ucrit. In contrast, data revealed strong effects of pectoral fin use on swimming cost and Ucrit. Poecilia reticulata employed body-caudal fin (BCF) swimming at all tested swimming speeds; however, fish with a high simultaneous use of the pectoral fins exhibited increased swimming cost and decreased Ucrit. These data indicated that combining BCF swimming and pectoral fin movement over a wide speed range, presumably to support swimming stability and control, is an inefficient swimming behaviour. Finally, transition to burst-assisted swimming was associated with an increase in aerobic metabolic rate. Our study highlights factors other than swimming speed that affect swimming cost and suggests that intraspecific diversity in biomechanical performance, such as pectoral fin use, is an important source of variation in both locomotor cost and maximal performance."},{"title":"Structural resonance and mode of flutter of hummingbird tail feathers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3404","abstract":"Feathers can produce sound by fluttering in airflow. This flutter is hypothesized to be aeroelastic, arising from the coupling of aerodynamic forces to one or more of the feather's intrinsic structural resonance frequencies. We investigated how mode of flutter varied among a sample of hummingbird tail feathers tested in a wind tunnel. Feather vibration was measured directly at ~100 points across the surface of the feather with a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (SLDV), as a function of airspeed, Uair. Most feathers exhibited multiple discrete modes of flutter, which we classified into types including tip, trailing vane and torsional modes. Vibratory behavior within a given mode was usually stable, but changes in independent variables such as airspeed or orientation sometimes caused feathers to abruptly ‘jump’ from one mode to another. We measured structural resonance frequencies and mode shapes directly by measuring the free response of 64 feathers stimulated with a shaker and recorded with the SLDV. As predicted by the aeroelastic flutter hypothesis, the mode shape (spatial distribution) of flutter corresponded to a bending or torsional structural resonance frequency of the feather. However, the match between structural resonance mode and flutter mode was better for tip or torsional mode shapes, and poorer for trailing vane modes. Often, the 3rd bending structural harmonic matched the expressed mode of flutter, rather than the fundamental. We conclude that flutter occurs when airflow excites one or more structural resonance frequencies of a feather, most akin to a vibrating violin string."},{"title":"Rough eyes of the northeast-Asian wood white, Leptidea amurensis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3414","abstract":"The northeast-Asian wood white, Leptidea amurensis (Lepidoptera, Pieridae), belongs to the Dismorphiinae, a subfamily of the family Pieridae. We studied the structure of the compound eye in this species through a combination of anatomy, molecular biology and intracellular electrophysiology, with a particular focus on the evolution of butterfly eyes. We found that their eyes consist of three types of ommatidia, with a basic set of one short-, one middle- and one long-wavelength-absorbing visual pigment. The spectral sensitivities of the photoreceptors are rather simple, and peak in the ultraviolet, blue and green wavelength regions. The ommatidia have neither perirhabdomal nor fluorescent pigments, which modulate photoreceptor spectral sensitivities in a number of other butterfly species. These features are primitive, but the eyes of Leptidea exhibit another unique feature: the rough appearance of the ventral two-thirds of the eye. The roughness is due to the irregular distribution of facets of two distinct sizes. As this phenomenon exists only in males, it may represent a newly evolved sex-related feature."},{"title":"Dose and developmental responses of Anopheles merus larvae to salinity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3433","abstract":"Saltwater tolerance is a trait that carries both ecological and epidemiological significance for Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit human malaria, as it plays a key role in determining their habitat use and ecological distribution, and thus their local contribution to malaria transmission. Here, we lay the groundwork for genetic dissection of this trait by quantifying saltwater tolerance in three closely related cryptic species and malaria vectors from the Afrotropical Anopheles gambiae complex that are known to differ starkly in their tolerance to salinity: the obligate freshwater species A. gambiae and A. coluzzii, and the saltwater-tolerant species A. merus. We performed detailed comparisons of survivorship under varying salinities, using multiple strains of A. gambiae, A. coluzzii and A. merus, as well as F1 progeny from reciprocal crosses of A. merus and A. coluzzii. Additionally, using immunohistochemistry, we compared the location of three ion regulatory proteins (Na+/K+-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase and Na+/H+-antiporter) in the recta of A. coluzzii and A. merus reared in freshwater or saline water. As expected, we found that A. merus survives exposure to high salinities better than A. gambiae and A. coluzzii. Further, we found that exposure to a salinity level of 15.85 g NaCl l−1 is a discriminating dose that kills all A. gambiae, A. coluzzii and A. coluzzii–A. merus F1 larvae, but does not negatively impact the survival of A. merus. Importantly, phenotypic expression of saltwater tolerance by A. merus is highly dependent upon the developmental time of exposure, and based on immunohistochemistry, salt tolerance appears to involve a major shift in Na+/K+-ATPase localization in the rectum, as observed previously for the distantly related saline-tolerant species A. albimanus."},{"title":"Limited effects of exogenous glucose during severe hypoxia and a lack of hypoxia-stimulated glucose uptake in isolated rainbow trout cardiac muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3422","abstract":"We examined whether exogenous glucose affects contractile performance of electrically paced ventricle strips from rainbow trout under conditions known to alter cardiomyocyte performance, ion regulation and energy demands. Physiological levels of d-glucose did not influence twitch force development for aerobic preparations (1) paced at 0.5 or 1.1 Hz, (2) at 15 or 23°C, (3) receiving adrenergic stimulation or (4) during reoxygenation with or without adrenaline after severe hypoxia. Contractile responses to ryanodine, an inhibitor of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, were also not affected by exogenous glucose. However, glucose did attenuate the fall in twitch force during severe hypoxia. Glucose uptake was assayed in non-contracting ventricle strips using 2-[3H] deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) under aerobic and hypoxic conditions, at different incubation temperatures and with different inhibitors. Based upon a lack of saturation of 2-DG uptake and incomplete inhibition of uptake by cytochalasin B and d-glucose, 2-DG uptake was mediated by a combination of facilitated transport and simple diffusion. Hypoxia stimulated lactate efflux sixfold to sevenfold with glucose present, but did not increase 2-DG uptake or reduce lactate efflux in the presence of cytochalasin B. Increasing temperature (14 to 24°C) also did not increase 2-DG uptake, but decreasing temperature (14 to 4°C) reduced 2-DG uptake by 45%. In conclusion, exogenous glucose improves mechanical performance under hypoxia but not under any of the aerobic conditions applied. The extracellular concentration of glucose and cold temperature appear to determine and limit cardiomyocyte glucose uptake, respectively, and together may help define a metabolic strategy that relies predominantly on intracellular energy stores."},{"title":"Precision of archerfish C-starts is fully temperature compensated","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3450","abstract":"Hunting archerfish precisely adapt their predictive C-starts to the initial movement of dislodged prey so that turn angle and initial speed are matched to the place and time of the later point of catch. The high accuracy and the known target point of the starts allow a sensitive straightforward assay of how temperature affects the underlying circuits. Furthermore, archerfish face rapid temperature fluctuations in their mangrove biotopes that could compromise performance. Here, we show that after a brief acclimation period the function of the C-starts was fully maintained over a range of operating temperatures: (i) full responsiveness was maintained at all temperatures, (ii) at all temperatures the fish selected accurate turns and were able to do so over the full angular range, (iii) at all temperatures speed attained immediately after the end of the C-start was matched – with equal accuracy – to ‘virtual speed’, i.e. the ratio of remaining distance to the future landing point and remaining time. While precision was fully temperature compensated, C-start latency was not and increased by about 4 ms per 1°C cooling. Also, kinematic aspects of the C-start were only partly temperature compensated. Above 26°C, the duration of the two major phases of the C-start were temperature compensated. At lower temperatures, however, durations increased similar to latency. Given the accessibility of the underlying networks, the archerfish predictive start should be an excellent model to assay the degree of plasticity and functional stability of C-start motor patterns."},{"title":"The effect of flow speed and body size on Kármán gait kinematics in rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3442","abstract":"We have little understanding of how fish hold station in unsteady flows. Here, we investigated the effect of flow speed and body size on the kinematics of rainbow trout Kármán gaiting behind a 5 cm diameter cylinder. We established a set of criteria revealing that not all fish positioned in a vortex street are Kármán gaiting. By far the highest probability of Kármán gaiting occurred at intermediate flow speeds between 30 and 70 cm s−1. We show that trout Kármán gait in a region of the cylinder wake where the velocity deficit is about 40% of the nominal flow. We observed that the relationships between certain kinematic and flow variables are largely preserved across flow speeds. Tail-beat frequency matched the measured vortex shedding frequency, which increased linearly with flow speed. Body wave speed was about 25% faster than the nominal flow velocity. At speeds where fish have a high probability of Kármán gaiting, body wavelength was about 25% longer than the cylinder wake wavelength. Likewise, the lateral (i.e. cross-stream) amplitude of the tail tip was about 50% greater than the expected lateral spacing of the cylinder vortices, while the body center amplitude was about 70% less. Lateral body center acceleration increased quadratically with speed. Head angle decreased with flow speed. While these values are different from those found in fish swimming in uniform flow, the strategy for locomotion is the same; fish adjust to increasing flow by increasing their tail-beat frequency. Body size also played a role in Kármán gaiting kinematics. Tail-beat amplitudes of Kármán gaiting increased with body size, as in freestream swimming, but were almost three times larger in magnitude. Larger fish had a shorter body wavelength and slower body wave speed than smaller fish, which is a surprising result compared with freestream swimming, where body wavelength and wave speed increased with size. In contrast to freestream swimming, tail-beat frequency for Kármán gaiting fish did not depend on body size and was a function of the vortex shedding frequency."},{"title":"Social regulation of maternal traits in nest-founding bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) queens","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3474","abstract":"During the nest-founding phase of the bumble bee colony cycle, queens undergo striking changes in maternal care behavior. Early in the founding phase, prior to the emergence of workers in the nest, queens are reproductive and also provision and feed their offspring. However, later in the founding phase, queens reduce their feeding of larvae and become specialized on reproduction. This transition is synchronized with the emergence of workers in the colony, who assume the task of feeding their siblings. Using a social manipulation experiment with the bumble bee Bombus terrestris, we tested the hypothesis that workers regulate the transition from feeding brood to specialization on reproduction in nest-founding bumble bee queens. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that early-stage nest-founding queens with workers prematurely added to their nests reduce their brood-feeding behavior and increase egg laying, and likewise, late-stage nest-founding queens increase their brood-feeding behavior and decrease egg-laying when workers are removed from their nests. Further, brood-feeding and egg-laying behaviors were negatively correlated. We used Agilent microarrays designed from B. terrestris brain expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) to explore a second hypothesis, that workers alter brain gene expression in nest-founding queens. We found evidence that brain gene expression in nest-founding queens is altered by the presence of workers, with the effect being much stronger in late-stage founding queens. This study provides new insights into how the transition from feeding brood to specialization on reproduction in queen bumble bees is regulated during the nest initiation phase of the colony cycle."},{"title":"Metabolic energy sensors (AMPK and SIRT1), protein carbonylation and cardiac failure as biomarkers of thermal stress in an intertidal limpet: linking energetic allocation with environmental temperature during aerial emersion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3273","abstract":"The effects of heat stress on organisms are manifested at the levels of organ function, metabolic activity, protein stability and gene expression.

Heart failure, indexed by the Arrhenius break temperature, occurred at 34.3°C. Protein carbonylation rose significantly at 38°C. Genes for heat shock proteins HSP70 (hsp70) and HSP90 (hsp90), for two subunits of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (ampkα and ampkβ) and for histone/protein deacetylase SIRT1 (sirt1) all showed increased expression at 30°C. Temperatures of maximal expression differed among genes, as did temperatures at which upregulation ceased. Expression patterns for ampk and sirt1 indicate that heat stress influenced cellular energy homeostasis; above ~30°C, upregulation of ATP-generating pathways is suggested by elevated expression of genes for ampk; an altered balance between reliance on carbohydrate and lipid fuels is indicated by changes in expression of sirt1. These results show that C. toreuma commonly experiences temperatures that induce expression of genes associated with the stress response (hsp70 and hsp90) and regulation of energy metabolism (ampk and sirt1). At high temperatures, there is likely to be a shift away from anabolic processes such as growth to catabolic processes, to provide energy for coping with stress-induced damage, notably to proteins."},{"title":"Nitric oxide affects short-term olfactory memory in the antennal lobe of Manduca sexta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3294","abstract":"Nitric oxide (NO) is thought to play an important neuromodulatory role in olfaction. We are using the hawkmoth Manduca sexta to investigate the function of NO signaling in the antennal lobe (AL; the primary olfactory network in invertebrates). We have found previously that NO is present at baseline levels, dramatically increases in response to odor stimulation, and alters the electrophysiology of AL neurons. It is unclear, however, how these effects contribute to common features of olfactory systems such as olfactory learning and memory, odor detection and odor discrimination. In this study, we used chemical detection and a behavioral approach to further examine the function of NO in the AL. We found that basal levels of NO fluctuate with the daily light cycle, being higher during the nocturnal active period. NO also appears to be necessary for short-term olfactory memory. NO does not appear to affect odor detection, odor discrimination between dissimilar odorants, or learning acquisition. These findings suggest a modulatory role for NO in the timing of olfactory-guided behaviors."},{"title":"Chemical structure of odorants and perceptual similarity in ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3314","abstract":"Animals are often immersed in a chemical world consisting of mixtures of many compounds rather than of single substances, and they constantly face the challenge of extracting relevant information out of the chemical landscape. To this purpose, the ability to discriminate among different stimuli with different valence is essential, but it is also important to be able to generalise, i.e. to treat different but similar stimuli as equivalent, as natural variation does not necessarily affect stimulus valence. Animals can thus extract regularities in their environment and make predictions, for instance about distribution of food resources. We studied perceptual similarity of different plant odours by conditioning individual carpenter ants to one odour, and subsequently testing their response to another, structurally different odour. We found that asymmetry in generalisation, where ants generalise from odour A to B, but not from B to A, is dependent on both chain length and functional group. By conditioning ants to a binary mixture, and testing their reaction to the individual components of the mixture, we show that overshadowing, where parts of a mixture are learned better than others, is rare. Additionally, generalisation is dependent not only on the structural similarity of odorants, but also on their functional value, which might play a crucial role. Our results provide insight into how ants make sense of the complex chemical world around them, for example in a foraging context, and provide a basis with which to investigate the neural mechanisms behind perceptual similarity."},{"title":"Beating oxygen: chronic anoxia exposure reduces mitochondrial F1FO-ATPase activity in turtle (Trachemys scripta) heart","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3283","abstract":"The freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta can survive in the complete absence of O2 (anoxia) for periods lasting several months. In mammals, anoxia leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, which culminates in cellular necrosis and apoptosis. Despite the obvious clinical benefits of understanding anoxia tolerance, little is known about the effects of chronic oxygen deprivation on the function of turtle mitochondria. In this study, we compared mitochondrial function in hearts of T. scripta exposed to either normoxia or 2 weeks of complete anoxia at 5°C and during simulated acute anoxia/reoxygenation. Mitochondrial respiration, electron transport chain activities, enzyme activities, proton conductance and membrane potential were measured in permeabilised cardiac fibres and isolated mitochondria. Two weeks of anoxia exposure at 5°C resulted in an increase in lactate, and decreases in ATP, glycogen, pH and phosphocreatine in the heart. Mitochondrial proton conductance and membrane potential were similar between experimental groups, while aerobic capacity was dramatically reduced. The reduced aerobic capacity was the result of a severe downregulation of the F1FO-ATPase (Complex V), which we assessed as a decrease in enzyme activity. Furthermore, in stark contrast to mammalian paradigms, isolated turtle heart mitochondria endured 20 min of anoxia followed by reoxygenation without any impact on subsequent ADP-stimulated O2 consumption (State III respiration) or State IV respiration. Results from this study demonstrate that turtle mitochondria remodel in response to chronic anoxia exposure and a reduction in Complex V activity is a fundamental component of mitochondrial and cellular anoxia survival."},{"title":"Sex-specific divergence for adaptations to dehydration stress in Drosophila kikkawai","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3301","abstract":"Several studies on diverse Drosophila species have reported higher desiccation resistance of females, but the physiological basis of such sex-specific differences has received less attention. We tested whether sex-specific differences in cuticular traits (melanic females and non-melanic males) of Drosophila kikkawai correspond with divergence in their water balance mechanisms. Our results are interesting in several respects. First, positive clinal variation in desiccation resistance was correlated with cuticular melanisation in females but with changes in cuticular lipid mass in males, despite a lack of differences between the sexes for the rate of water loss. Second, a comparative analysis of water budget showed that females of the northern population stored more body water as well as hemolymph content and exhibited greater dehydration tolerance than flies from the southern tropics. In contrast, we found no geographical variation in the males for water content and dehydration tolerance. Third, an ~10-fold increase in the rate of water loss after organic solvent treatment of male D. kikkawai suggested a role of cuticular lipids in cuticular transpiration, but had no effect in the females. Fourth, geographical differences in the storage of carbohydrate content (metabolic fuel) were observed in females but not in males. Interestingly, in females, the rate of utilization of carbohydrates did not vary geographically, but males from drier localities showed a 50% reduction compared with wetter localities. Thus, body melanisation, increased body water, hemolymph, carbohydrate content and greater dehydration tolerance confer greater desiccation resistance in females, but a reduced rate of water loss is the only possible mechanism to cope with drought stress in males. Finally, acclimated females showed a significant increase in drought resistance associated with higher trehalose content as well as dehydration tolerance, while males showed no acclimation response. Thus, sex-specific differences in desiccation resistance of D. kikkawai are associated with divergence in some water balance strategies, despite a lack of differences in the rate of water loss between the two sexes."},{"title":"Incline and peg spacing have interactive effects on the arboreal locomotor performance and kinematics of brown tree snakes, Boiga irregularis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3321","abstract":"Many animals move using lateral undulations, but snakes are noteworthy for using this type of locomotion in an unusual diversity of environments, including trees in which both the spacing and orientation of branches vary considerably. Despite branches providing discrete locations for snakes to generate propulsive forces during lateral undulation, the consequences of branch spacing for the locomotion of snakes are poorly understood. Hence, we determined maximal speeds and kinematics of an arboreal snake (Boiga irregularis) crawling on horizontal and vertical cylinders with pegs that simulated different spacing between secondary branches. Peg spacing, perch orientation and their two-way interaction term had widespread, significant effects on both performance and kinematics. For the horizontal surfaces, maximal locomotor speed occurred with intermediate peg spacing, and it was nearly twice as fast as for both the smallest and largest peg spacings. By contrast, the locomotor speed of snakes on the vertical surfaces was unaffected by peg spacing, and was uniformly slower than that for the horizontal surfaces. For both perch orientations, the number of pegs touched by the snake decreased as peg spacing increased, and while touching only one peg the snakes crawled with apparent ease and steady speed. The snakes crawled vertically with only one peg as quickly as they did using 2–10 pegs. Pegs on a horizontal cylinder are probably important both for propulsion of snakes and prevention of long-axis rolling, whereas pegs protruding from vertical cylinders and those protruding from horizontal planar surfaces are probably used almost exclusively for propulsion."},{"title":"Insights from venous oxygen profiles: oxygen utilization and management in diving California sea lions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3332","abstract":"The management and depletion of O2 stores underlie the aerobic dive capacities of marine mammals. The California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) presumably optimizes O2 store management during all dives, but approaches its physiological limits during deep dives to greater than 300 m depth. Blood O2 comprises the largest component of total body O2 stores in adult sea lions. Therefore, we investigated venous blood O2 depletion during dives of California sea lions during maternal foraging trips to sea by: (1) recording venous partial pressure of O2 (PO2) profiles during dives, (2) characterizing the O2–hemoglobin (Hb) dissociation curve of sea lion Hb and (3) converting the PO2 profiles into percent Hb saturation (SO2) profiles using the dissociation curve. The O2–Hb dissociation curve was typical of other pinnipeds (P50=28±2 mmHg at pH 7.4). In 43% of dives, initial venous SO2 values were greater than 78% (estimated resting venous SO2), indicative of arterialization of venous blood. Blood O2 was far from depleted during routine shallow dives, with minimum venous SO2 values routinely greater than 50%. However, in deep dives greater than 4 min in duration, venous SO2 reached minimum values below 5% prior to the end of the dive, but then increased during the last 30–60 s of ascent. These deep dive profiles were consistent with transient venous blood O2 depletion followed by partial restoration of venous O2 through pulmonary gas exchange and peripheral blood flow during ascent. These differences in venous O2 profiles between shallow and deep dives of sea lions reflect distinct strategies of O2 store management and suggest that underlying cardiovascular responses will also differ."},{"title":"Wind induces variations in spider web geometry and sticky spiral droplet volume","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3342","abstract":"Trap building by animals is rare because it comes at a substantial cost. Using materials with properties that vary across environments maintains trap functionality. The sticky spiral silks of spider orb webs are used to catch flying prey. Web geometry, accompanied by compensatory changes in silk properties, may change across environments to sustain web functionality. We exposed the spider Cyclosa mulmeinensis to wind to test whether wind-induced changes in web geometry are accompanied by changes in aggregate silk droplet morphology, axial thread width or spiral stickiness. We compared: (i) web catching area, (ii) length of total silks, (iii) mesh height, (iv) number of radii, (v) aggregate droplet morphology and (vi) spiral thread stickiness, between webs made by spiders exposed to wind and those made by spiders not exposed to wind. We interpreted co-variation in droplet morphology or spiral stickiness with web capture area, mesh height or spiral length as the silk properties functionally compensating for changes in web geometry to reduce wind drag. Wind-exposed C. mulmeinensis built webs with smaller capture areas, shorter capture spiral lengths and more widely spaced capture spirals, resulting in the expenditure of less silk. Individuals that were exposed to wind also deposited larger droplets of sticky silk but the stickiness of the spiral threads remained unchanged. The larger droplets may be a product of a greater investment in water, or low molecular weight compounds facilitating atmospheric water uptake. Either way, droplet dehydration in wind is likely to be minimized."},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake. XIX.

DEE increased from 105.1±4.0 kJ day−1 at 30°C to 134.7±5.6 kJ day−1 at 21°C and 179.5±8.4 kJ day−1 at 10°C on days 14–16 of lactation. With nearly identical mean litter sizes, lactating gerbils at 30°C exported 32.0 kJ day−1 less energy as milk at peak lactation than those allocated to 10 or 21°C, with no difference between the latter groups. On day 14 of lactation, the litter masses at 10 and 30°C were 12.2 and 9.3 g lower than those at 21°C, respectively. Lactating gerbils had higher thermal conductance of the fur and lower UCP-1 levels in brown adipose tissue than non-reproductive gerbils, independent of ambient temperature, suggesting that they were attempting to avoid heat stress. Thermal conductance of the fur was positively related to circulating prolactin levels. We implanted non-reproductive gerbils with mini-osmotic pumps that delivered either prolactin or saline. Prolactin did not influence thermal conductance of the fur, but did reduce physical activity and UCP-1 levels in brown adipose tissue. Transferring lactating gerbils from warm to hot conditions resulted in reduced milk production, consistent with the heat dissipation limit theory, but transferring them from warm to cold conditions did not elevate milk production, consistent with the peripheral limitation hypothesis, and placed constraints on pup growth."},{"title":"Physiological and metabolic consequences of viral infection in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3350","abstract":"An extensively used model system for investigating anti-pathogen defence and innate immunity involves Drosophila C virus (DCV) and Drosophila melanogaster. While there has been a significant effort to understand infection consequences at molecular and genetic levels, an understanding of fundamental higher-level physiology of this system is lacking. Here, we investigate the metabolic rate, locomotory activity, dry mass and water content of adult male flies injected with DCV, measured over the 4 days prior to virus-induced mortality. DCV infection resulted in multiple pathologies, notably the depression of metabolic rate beginning 2 days post-infection as a response to physiological stress. Even in this depressed metabolic state, infected flies did not decrease their activity until 1 day prior to mortality, which further suggests that cellular processes and synthesis are disrupted because of viral infection. Growth rate was also reduced, indicating that energy partitioning is altered as infection progresses. Microbial infection in insects typically results in an increase in excretion; however, water appeared to be retained in DCV-infected flies. We hypothesise that this is due to a fluid intake–output imbalance due to disrupted transport signalling and a reduced rate of metabolic processing. Furthermore, infected flies had a reduced rate of respiration as a consequence of metabolic depression, which minimised water loss, and the excess mass as a result of water retention is concurrent with impaired locomotory ability. These findings contribute to developing a mechanistic understanding of how pathologies accumulate and lead to mortality in infected flies."},{"title":"Sound production mechanism in Gobius paganellus (Gobiidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3189","abstract":"Gobiidae, the largest fish family (>1500 species), has species from at least 10 genera that produce sounds for communication. Studies focused on goby sound production mechanisms have suggested that sounds are produced by the forcible ejection of water through small apertures in the opercles (hydrodynamic mechanism). The present study was a multidisciplinary investigation (morphology, muscle histology, high-speed video, sound analysis and electromyography) of the sound emission mechanism in Gobius paganellus, which produces both pulsed and tonal calls. Two populations were used, from Brittany and Venice. In the French population, sounds were accompanied by a suite of coordinated movements of the buccal, branchial and opercular regions. This was not the case in the Venetian population, and thus the direct role of head movements in sound production was rejected. The hydrodynamic mechanism hypothesis was also rejected in G. paganellus on the basis of sound oscillogram shape and because sounds are still produced after the opercles and hyohyoid muscles are cut. The use of both electromyography and electron microscopy showed that the levator pectoralis muscle, which originates on the skull and inserts on the dorsal tip of the cleithrum, is involved in sound production. We propose that the contraction of this muscle and associated vibration of the large radials is used to make sounds. In addition, we propose that different sound types (pulsed sounds and tonal calls) could occur because of differences in fish size."},{"title":"Bilateral flight muscle activity predicts wing kinematics and 3-dimensional body orientation of locusts responding to looming objects","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3369","abstract":"We placed locusts in a wind tunnel using a loose tether design that allowed for motion in all three rotational degrees of freedom during presentation of a computer-generated looming disc. High-speed video allowed us to extract wing kinematics, abdomen position and 3-dimensional body orientation. Concurrent electromyographic (EMG) recordings monitored bilateral activity from the first basalar depressor muscles (m97) of the forewings, which are implicated in flight steering. Behavioural responses to a looming disc included cessation of flight (wings folded over the body), glides and active steering during sustained flight in addition to a decrease and increase in wingbeat frequency prior to and during, respectively, an evasive turn. Active steering involved shifts in bilateral m97 timing, wing asymmetries and whole-body rotations in the yaw (ψ), pitch (χ) and roll (η) planes. Changes in abdomen position and hindwing asymmetries occurred after turns were initiated. Forewing asymmetry and changes in η were most highly correlated with m97 spike latency. Correlations also increased as the disc approached, peaking prior to collision. On the inside of a turn, m97 spikes occurred earlier relative to forewing stroke reversal and bilateral timing corresponded to forewing asymmetry as well as changes in whole-body rotation. Double spikes in each m97 occurred most frequently at or immediately prior to the time the locusts turned, suggesting a behavioural significance. These data provide information on mechanisms underlying 3-dimensional flight manoeuvres and will be used to drive a closed loop flight simulator to study responses of motion-sensitive visual neurons during production of realistic behaviours."},{"title":"Heart rate responses to temperature in free-swimming Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3208","abstract":"The bluefin tuna heart remains at ambient water temperature (Ta) but must supply blood to warm regions of the body served by countercurrent vascular heat exchangers.

We then compared the visual sensitivity of red-eyed mutants and wild types by measuring the photonegative responses of insects reared in light:dark cycles [12 h:12 h light:dark (LD)] or constant darkness (DD). Finally, we analyzed both the impact of oxidative stress associated with blood ingestion and photodamage of UV light on the eye retina. We found that red-eyed mutants reared in DD conditions were the most sensitive to the light intensities tested. Retinae of LD-reared mutants were gradually damaged over the life cycle, while for DD-reared insects retinae were conserved intact. No retinal damage was observed in non-fed mutants exposed to UV light for 2 weeks, whereas insects fed on blood prior to UV exposure showed clear signs of retinal damage. Wild-type insects exposed to UV light showed a marked increase in the amount and density of screening pigments."},{"title":"Activation of systemic, but not local, renin–angiotensin system is associated with upregulation of TNF-α during prolonged fasting in northern elephant seal pups","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3215","abstract":"Northern elephant seal pups naturally endure a 2–3 month post-weaning fast that is associated with activation of systemic renin–angiotensin system (RAS), a decrease in plasma adiponectin (Acrp30), and insulin resistance (IR)-like conditions. Angiotensin II (Ang II) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are potential causal factors of IR, while Acrp30 may improve insulin signaling. However, the effects of fasting-induced activation of RAS on IR-like conditions in seals are not well described. To assess the effects of prolonged food deprivation on systemic and local RAS, and their potential contribution to TNF-α as they relate to an IR condition, the mRNA expressions of adipose and muscle RAS components and immuno-relevant molecules were measured along with plasma RAS components. Mean plasma renin activity and Ang II concentrations increased by 89 and 1658%, respectively, while plasma angiotensinogen (AGT) decreased by 49% over the fast, indicative of systemic RAS activation. Prolonged fasting was associated with decreases in adipose and muscle AGT mRNA expressions of 69 and 68%, respectively, corresponding with decreases in tissue protein content, suggesting suppression of local AGT production. Muscle TNF-α mRNA and protein increased by 239 and 314%, whereas those of adipose Acrp30 decreased by 32 and 98%, respectively. Collectively, this study suggests that prolonged fasting activates a systemic RAS, which contributes to an increase in muscle TNF-α and suppression of adipose Acrp30. This targeted and tissue-specific regulation of TNF-α and Acrp30 is likely coordinated to synergistically contribute to the development of an IR-like condition, independent of local RAS activity. These data enhance our understanding of the adaptive mechanisms evolved by elephant seals to tolerate potentially detrimental conditions."},{"title":"Long-term fasting in the anadromous Arctic charr is associated with downregulation of metabolic enzyme activity and upregulation of leptin A1 and SOCS expression in the liver","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3222","abstract":"The life strategy of the anadromous Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) includes several months of voluntary fasting during overwintering in freshwater, leading to emaciation prior to seawater migration in spring. In this study we compared changes in condition, substrate utilization and liver metabolism between captive anadromous charr subjected to food deprivation during late winter and spring, and conspecifics fed in excess. In March, nine out of the 10 sampled fed fish had not eaten, indicating that they were in a voluntary anorexic state. In June, the fed fish were eating and all had higher body mass, condition factor and adiposity than in March. In fasted fish there were only small decreases in body mass, condition factor and adiposity between March and May, but all these parameters decreased markedly from May to June. The fasted fish were depleted in fat and glycogen in June, had suppressed activity of hepatic enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (G6PDH and HOAD) and seemed to rely on protein-derived glucose as a major energy source. This was associated with upregulated liver gene expression of leptin A1, leptin A2, SOCS1, SOCS2 and SOCS3, and reduced IGF-I expression. In an in vitro study with liver slices it was shown that recombinant rainbow trout leptin stimulated SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression, but not SOCS2, IGF-I or genes of enzymes involved in lipid (G6PDH) and amino acid (AspAT) metabolism. It is concluded that liver leptin interacts with SOCS in a paracrine fashion to suppress lipolytic pathways and depress metabolism when fat stores are depleted."},{"title":"Selective prey avoidance learning in the predatory sea slug Pleurobranchaea californica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3231","abstract":"Predator–prey interactions involving aposematic signaling, where predators learn the warning cues of well-defended prey, are clear examples of cost–benefit decisions in foraging animals. However, knowledge of the selectivity of predator learning and the natural conditions where it occurs is lacking for those foragers simpler in brain and body plan. We pursued the question in the sea slug Pleurobranchaea californica, a generalist forager of marked simplicity of body form, nervous system and behavior. This predator exploits many different types of prey, some of which are costly to attack. When offered Flabellina iodinea, an aeolid nudibranch with a stinging defense, biting attack was followed by rapid rejection and aversive turns. The predatory sea slug rapidly learned avoidance. Notable exceptions were animals with extremely high or low feeding thresholds that either ignored F. iodinea or completely consumed it, respectively. Experienced slugs showed strong avoidance of F. iodinea for days after exposure. Aposematic odor learning was selective: avoidance was not linked to change in feeding thresholds, and trained animals readily attacked and consumed a related aeolid, Hermissenda crassicornis. For P. californica, aposematic learning is a cognitive adaptation in which sensation, motivation and memory are integrated to direct cost–benefit choice, and thereby lend flexibility to the generalist's foraging strategy."},{"title":"The gait dynamics of the modern broiler chicken: a cautionary tale of selective breeding","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3237","abstract":"One of the most extraordinary results of selective breeding is the modern broiler chicken, whose phenotypic attributes reflect its genetic success. Unfortunately, leg health issues and poor walking ability are prevalent in the broiler population, with the exact aetiopathogenesis unknown. Here we present a biomechanical analysis of the gait dynamics of the modern broiler and its two pureline commercial broiler breeder lines (A and B) in order to clarify how changes in basic morphology are associated with the way these chickens walk. We collected force plate and kinematic data from 25 chickens (market age), over a range of walking speeds, to quantify the three-dimensional dynamics of the centre of mass (CoM) and determine how these birds modulate the force and mechanical work of locomotion. Common features of their gait include extremely slow walking speeds, a wide base of support and large lateral motions of the CoM, which primarily reflect changes to cope with their apparent instability and large body mass. These features allowed the chickens to keep their peak vertical forces low, but resulted in high mediolateral forces, which exceeded fore–aft forces. Gait differences directly related to morphological characteristics also exist. This was particularly evident in Pureline B birds, which have a more crouched limb posture. Mechanical costs of transport were still similar across all lines and were not exceptional when compared with more wild-type ground-running birds. Broiler chickens seem to have an awkward gait, but some aspects of their dynamics show rather surprising similarities to other avian bipeds."},{"title":"Specific response to herbivore-induced de novo synthesized plant volatiles provides reliable information for host plant selection in a moth","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3257","abstract":"Animals depend on reliable sensory information for accurate behavioural decisions. For herbivorous insects it is crucial to find host plants for feeding and reproduction, and these insects must be able to differentiate suitable from unsuitable plants. Volatiles are important cues for insect herbivores to assess host plant quality. It has previously been shown that female moths of the Egyptian cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), avoid oviposition on damaged cotton Gossypium hirsutum, which may mediated by herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Among the HIPVs, some volatiles are released following any type of damage while others are synthesized de novo and released by the plants only in response to herbivore damage. In behavioural experiments we here show that oviposition by S. littoralis on undamaged cotton plants was reduced by adding volatiles collected from plants with ongoing herbivory. Gas chromatography–electroantennographic detection (GC–EAD) recordings revealed that antennae of mated S. littoralis females responded to 18 compounds from a collection of headspace volatiles of damaged cotton plants. Among these compounds, a blend of the seven de novo synthesized volatile compounds was found to reduce oviposition in S. littoralis on undamaged plants under both laboratory and ambient (field) conditions in Egypt. Volatile compounds that are not produced de novo by the plants did not affect oviposition. Our results show that ovipositing females respond specifically to the de novo synthesized volatiles released from plants under herbivore attack. We suggest that these volatiles provide reliable cues for ovipositing females to detect plants that could provide reduced quality food for their offspring and an increased risk of competition and predation."},{"title":"Repeatability of escape response performance in the queen scallop, Aequipecten opercularis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3264","abstract":"In order for natural selection to operate, physiological and behavioural traits must exhibit both inter-individual variability and intra-individual consistency (i.e. repeatability) in performance. In this study, we describe individual variation and temporal repeatability in the escape responses of the queen scallop, Aequipecten opercularis, and determine whether individuals exhibited consistently high or low rankings in different aspects of the escape response. Five measures of individual performance were recorded on four occasions (days 0, 2, 7 and 28), providing proxies for sensory acuity (response latency), immediate and sustained swimming performance (burst and average clap rates), and swimming endurance (total number of claps and total time spent clapping). All components of the escape response exhibited significant inter-individual variability (all P<0.0001). Escape response latency, burst clap rate, total number of claps and total duration spent clapping maintained significant repeatability over 28 days (all P<0.016). Average clap rate was repeatable in the short term (2 days, P<0.0001) but repeatability declined by 28 days (P=0.097). Concordance analysis indicated that individuals maintained the same performance rankings over time for each component of the escape response (all P<0.001). In addition, some individuals ranked as consistently high or low performers across response latency, burst and average clap rate, and total number of claps. An individual's ability to evade predators through the provision of an escape response of an appropriate magnitude, subject to physiological, behavioural and organismal constraints, will have clear fitness-related consequences."},{"title":"Hibernation physiology, freezing adaptation and extreme freeze tolerance in a northern population of the wood frog","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3461","abstract":"We investigated hibernation physiology and freeze tolerance in a population of the wood frog, Rana sylvatica, indigenous to Interior Alaska, USA, near the northernmost limit of the species' range. Winter acclimatization responses included a 233% increase in the hepatic glycogen depot that was subsidized by fat body and skeletal muscle catabolism, and a rise in plasma osmolality that reflected accrual of urea (to 106±10 μmol ml−1) and an unidentified solute (to ~73 μmol ml−1). In contrast, frogs from a cool-temperate population (southern Ohio, USA) amassed much less glycogen, had a lower uremia (28±5 μmol ml−1) and apparently lacked the unidentified solute. Alaskan frogs survived freezing at temperatures as low as −16°C, some 10–13°C below those tolerated by southern conspecifics, and endured a 2-month bout of freezing at −4°C. The profound freeze tolerance is presumably due to their high levels of organic osmolytes and bound water, which limits ice formation. Adaptive responses to freezing (−2.5°C for 48 h) and subsequent thawing (4°C) included synthesis of the cryoprotectants urea and glucose, and dehydration of certain tissues. Alaskan frogs differed from Ohioan frogs in retaining a substantial reserve capacity for glucose synthesis, accumulating high levels of cryoprotectants in brain tissue, and remaining hyperglycemic long after thawing. The northern phenotype also incurred less stress during freezing/thawing, as indicated by limited cryohemolysis and lactate accumulation. Post-glacial colonization of high latitudes by R. sylvatica required a substantial increase in freeze tolerance that was at least partly achieved by enhancing their cryoprotectant system."},{"title":"Long-day photoperiod interacts with vasopressin and food restriction to modulate reproductive status and vasopressin receptor expression of male golden spiny mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/18/3495","abstract":"We tested the effects of photoperiod, water and food availability on body mass, reproductive status and arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (Avpr1a) mRNA expression in males of desert-adapted golden spiny mice, Acomys russatus. In Experiment 1, males were acclimated to short-day (SD; 8 h:16 h light:dark) or long-day (LD; 16 h:8 h light:dark) photoperiods with either saline (control) or vasopressin treatment for 3 weeks. The results of this experiment revealed that under control conditions, SD mice increased body mass by ~5% while LD mice decreased it by ~4%. SD photoperiod had no effect on reproductive status and leptin levels, whereas LD males increased testes mass and serum testosterone, but the photoperiod had no effect on leptin levels. Vasopressin administration decreased LD-induced reproductive enhancement. Because no consistent effect of SD treatment was found on reproductive status, Experiment 2 was carried out only on LD-acclimated males kept under 75% food restriction (decrease from ad libitum) with saline or leptin treatment. Body mass, testes mass, serum testosterone, leptin concentrations and Avpr1a mRNA expression were measured. Food restriction remarkably decreased body mass, with a more potent effect in leptin-treated males, showing enhanced reproductive status and a significant increase in serum leptin compared with controls. Avpr1a expression was significantly upregulated in LD, vasopressin-treated and food-restricted males, with higher levels in the hypothalamus compared with the testes. We conclude that in A. russatus, LD photoperiod interacts with water and food availability to advance reproductive responses. Avpr1a is suggested to integrate nutritional and osmotic signals to optimize reproduction by modulating reproductive and energetic neuroendocrine axes at the central level. The interaction between photoperiod and other environmental cues is of an adaptive value to desert-adapted small rodents for timing reproduction in unpredictable ecosystems such as extreme deserts."},{"title":"Attachment ability of a clamp-bearing fish parasite, Diplozoon paradoxum (Monogenea), on gills of the common bream, Abramis brama","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3008","abstract":"Monogeneans, which are mainly fish ectoparasites, use various types of haptoral (posterior) attachment apparatus to secure their attachment onto their hosts. However, it remains unclear how strongly a monogenean can attach onto its host. In the present study, we aimed for the first time to (1) measure pull-off forces required to detach a pair of clamp-bearing monogeneans, Diplozoon paradoxum, from gills of Abramis brama and (2) determine the contribution of muscles to the clamp movements. A mean force of 6.1±2.7 mN (~246 times the animals' weight) was required to dislodge a paired D. paradoxum vertically from the gills. There were significant differences (P<0.05, Tukey test) between the widths of clamp openings in D. paradoxum treated in three different solutions: the widest clamp openings were observed in the monogeneans treated in 100 mmol l−1 potassium chloride solution (58.26±13.44 μm), followed by those treated in 20 mmol l−1 magnesium chloride solution (37.91±7.58 μm), and finally those treated in filtered lake water (20.16±8.63 μm). This suggests that the closing of the clamps is probably not due to the continuous contraction of extrinsic muscles but is caused by the elasticity of the clamp material and that muscle activity is required for clamp opening."},{"title":"Rh proteins and NH4+-activated Na+-ATPase in the Magadi tilapia (Alcolapia grahami), a 100% ureotelic teleost fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/2998","abstract":"The small cichlid fish Alcolapia grahami lives in Lake Magadi, Kenya, one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth (pH ~10, carbonate alkalinity ~300 mequiv l−1). The Magadi tilapia is the only 100% ureotelic teleost; it normally excretes no ammonia. This is interpreted as an evolutionary adaptation to overcome the near impossibility of sustaining an NH3 diffusion gradient across the gills against the high external pH. In standard ammoniotelic teleosts, branchial ammonia excretion is facilitated by Rh glycoproteins, and cortisol plays a role in upregulating these carriers, together with other components of a transport metabolon, so as to actively excrete ammonia during high environmental ammonia (HEA) exposure. In Magadi tilapia, we show that at least three Rh proteins (Rhag, Rhbg and Rhcg2) are expressed at the mRNA level in various tissues, and are recognized in the gills by specific antibodies. During HEA exposure, plasma ammonia levels and urea excretion rates increase markedly, and mRNA expression for the branchial urea transporter mtUT is elevated. Plasma cortisol increases and branchial mRNAs for Rhbg, Rhcg2 and Na+,K+-ATPase are all upregulated. Enzymatic activity of the latter is activated preferentially by NH4+ (versus K+), suggesting it can function as an NH4+-transporter. Model calculations suggest that active ammonia excretion against the gradient may become possible through a combination of Rh protein and NH4+-activated Na+-ATPase function."},{"title":"Glossosoma nigrior (Trichoptera: Glossosomatidae) respiration in moving fluid","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3015","abstract":"Laboratory measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) uptake by Glossosoma nigrior Banks were conducted in a sealed, recirculating flume under variable fluid flow velocities. Measurements were performed in similar water temperatures, DO concentrations and fluid flow velocities to field conditions in the stream where the larvae were obtained. Total oxygen uptake by both cased larvae and corresponding cases without larvae were quantified. An increased fluid flow velocity corresponded to an increased larval DO uptake rate. Oxygen uptake by the larval cases alone was not as sensitive to changes in the Peclet (Pe) number, the dimensionless ratio of advective to diffusive DO transport, as uptake by larvae themselves. The flux of DO to larvae and their cases was up to seven times larger in a moving fluid in comparison to non-moving fluid conditions in the proximity of larvae for 0<Pe<175. A functional relationship was developed relating fluid flow and DO uptake across a larval case. According to the proposed quantitative relationship, Pe alone describes 91% of the variation in the DO flux to the larvae under variable fluid flow conditions. In response to fluid motion, larvae depicted two characteristic behavioral responses. When the ratio of advective DO transport to diffusive transport was low (Pe<87), larvae occasionally abandoned their cases or spent more time partially extended from their cases. At Pe>87, larvae typically remained in their cases. This indicates that oxygen delivery to the larvae at low Pe is insufficient to satisfy the respiratory demands of cased larvae."},{"title":"Through their eyes: selective attention in peahens during courtship","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3035","abstract":"Conspicuous, multicomponent ornamentation in male animals can be favored by female mate choice but we know little about the cognitive processes females use to evaluate these traits. Sexual selection may favor attention mechanisms allowing the choosing females to selectively and efficiently acquire relevant information from complex male display traits and, in turn, may favor male display traits that effectively capture and hold female attention. Using a miniaturized telemetric gaze-tracker, we show that peahens (Pavo cristatus) selectively attend to specific components of peacock courtship displays and virtually ignore other, highly conspicuous components. Females gazed at the lower train but largely ignored the head, crest and upper train. When the lower train was obscured, however, females spent more time gazing at the upper train and approached the upper train from a distance. Our results suggest that peahens mainly evaluate the lower train during close-up courtship but use the upper train as a long-distance attraction signal. Furthermore, we found that behavioral display components (train rattling and wing shaking) captured and maintained female attention, indicating that interactions between display components may promote the evolution of multicomponent displays. Taken together, these findings suggest that selective attention plays a crucial role in sexual selection and likely influences the evolution of male display traits."},{"title":"Environmental response and adaptation of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of viscous prey capture threads from araneoid spider orb-webs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3023","abstract":"Viscous threads that form the prey capture spiral of araneoid orb-webs retain insects that strike the web, giving a spider more time to locate and subdue them. The viscoelastic glycoprotein glue responsible for this adhesion forms the core of regularly spaced aqueous droplets, which are supported by protein axial fibers. Glycoprotein extensibility both facilitates the recruitment of adhesion from multiple droplets and dissipates the energy generated by insects struggling to free themselves from the web. Compounds in the aqueous material make the droplets hygroscopic, causing an increase in both droplet volume and extensibility as humidity (RH) rises. We characterized these humidity-mediated responses at 20%, 37%, 55%, 72% and 90% RH in two large orb-weavers, Argiope aurantia, which is found in exposed habitats, and Neoscona crucifera, which occupies forests and forest edges. The volume-specific extension of A. aurantia glycoprotein reached a maximum value at 55% RH and then declined, whereas that of N. crucifera increased exponentially through the RH range. As RH increased, the relative stress on droplet filaments at maximum extension, as gauged by axial line deflection, decreased in a linear fashion in A. aurantia, but in N. crucifer increased logarithmically, indicating that N. crucifera threads are better equipped to dissipate energy through droplet elongation. The greater hygroscopicity of A. aurantia threads equips them to function in lower RH environments and during the afternoon when RH drops, but their performance is diminished during the high RH of the morning hours. In contrast, the lower hygroscopicity of N. crucifera threads optimizes their performance for intermediate and high RH environments and during the night and morning. These interspecific differences support the hypothesis that viscous capture threads are adapted to the humidity regime of an orb-weaver's habitat."},{"title":"Biomechanics of spontaneous overground walk-to-run transition","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3047","abstract":"The purpose of the present study was to describe the biomechanics of spontaneous walk-to-run transitions (WRTs) in humans. After minimal instructions, 17 physically active subjects performed WRTs on an instrumented runway, enabling measurement of speed, acceleration, spatiotemporal variables, ground reaction forces and 3D kinematics. The present study describes (1) the mechanical energy fluctuations of the body centre-of-mass (BCOM) as a reflection of the whole-body dynamics and (2) the joint kinematics and kinetics. Consistent with previous research, the spatiotemporal variables showed a sudden switch from walking to running in one transition step. During this step there was a sudden increase in forward speed, the so-called speed jump (0.42 m s−1). At total body level, this was reflected in a sudden increase in energy of the BCOM (0.83±0.14 J kg−1) and an abrupt change from an out-of-phase to an in-phase organization of the kinetic and potential energy fluctuations. During the transition step a larger net propulsive impulse compared with the preceding and following steps was observed due to a decrease in the braking impulse. This suggests that the altered landing configuration (prepared during the last 40% of the preceding swing) places the body in an optimal configuration to minimize this braking impulse. We hypothesize this configuration also evokes a reflex allowing a more powerful push off, which generates enough power to complete the transition and launch the first flight phase. This powerful push-off was also reflected in the vertical ground reaction force, which suddenly changed to a running pattern."},{"title":"Context affects nestmate recognition errors in honey bees and stingless bees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3055","abstract":"Nestmate recognition studies, where a discriminator first recognises and then behaviourally discriminates (accepts/rejects) another individual, have used a variety of methodologies and contexts. This is potentially problematic because recognition errors in discrimination behaviour are predicted to be context-dependent. Here we compare the recognition decisions (accept/reject) of discriminators in two eusocial bees, Apis mellifera and Tetragonisca angustula, under different contexts. These contexts include natural guards at the hive entrance (control); natural guards held in plastic test arenas away from the hive entrance that vary either in the presence or absence of colony odour or the presence or absence of an additional nestmate discriminator; and, for the honey bee, the inside of the nest. For both honey bee and stingless bee guards, total recognition errors of behavioural discrimination made by guards (% nestmates rejected + % non-nestmates accepted) are much lower at the colony entrance (honey bee: 30.9%; stingless bee: 33.3%) than in the test arenas (honey bee: 60–86%; stingless bee: 61–81%; P<0.001 for both). Within the test arenas, the presence of colony odour specifically reduced the total recognition errors in honey bees, although this reduction still fell short of bringing error levels down to what was found at the colony entrance. Lastly, in honey bees, the data show that the in-nest collective behavioural discrimination by ca. 30 workers that contact an intruder is insufficient to achieve error-free recognition and is not as effective as the discrimination by guards at the entrance. Overall, these data demonstrate that context is a significant factor in a discriminators' ability to make appropriate recognition decisions, and should be considered when designing recognition study methodologies."},{"title":"A false killer whale reduces its hearing sensitivity when a loud sound is preceded by a warning","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3062","abstract":"We investigated the possibility of conditioned dampening of whale hearing thresholds when a loud sound is preceded by a warning sound. The loud sound was a tone of 20 kHz, 170 dB re. 1 μPa, 5 s. Hearing sensitivity was measured using pip-train test stimuli and auditory evoked potential recording. The same test-sound stimuli served as warning sounds. The durations of the warning sounds were varied randomly to avoid locking an anticipated conditioning effect to the timing immediately before the loud sound. When the warning sound lasted from 1 to 9 s or from 5 to 35 s prior to the loud sound, hearing thresholds before the loud sound increased, relative to the baseline, by 12.7 and 7.3 dB, respectively. When the warning sound duration varied within a range of 20 to 140 s, the threshold increase was as low as 3.0 dB. The observed hearing threshold increase was not a result of the unconditioned effect of the loud sound, like a temporary threshold shift, so it was considered to be a manifestation of a conditioned dampening of hearing when the subject anticipated the quick appearance of a loud sound, most likely to protect its hearing."},{"title":"Visually guided gradation of prey capture movements in larval zebrafish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3071","abstract":"A mechanistic understanding of goal-directed behavior in vertebrates is hindered by the relative inaccessibility and size of their nervous systems. Here, we have studied the kinematics of prey capture behavior in a highly accessible vertebrate model organism, the transparent larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), to assess whether they use visual cues to systematically adjust their movements. We found that zebrafish larvae scale the speed and magnitude of turning movements according to the azimuth of one of their standard prey, paramecia. They also bias the direction of subsequent swimming movements based on prey azimuth and select forward or backward movements based on the prey's direction of travel. Once within striking distance, larvae generate either ram or suction capture behaviors depending on their distance from the prey. From our experimental estimations of ocular receptive fields, we ascertained that the ultimate decision to consume prey is likely a function of the progressive vergence of the eyes that places the target in a proximal binocular ‘capture zone’. By repeating these experiments in the dark, we demonstrate that paramecia are only consumed if they contact the anterior extremities of larvae, which triggers ocular vergence and tail movements similar to close proximity captures in lit conditions. These observations confirm the importance of vision in the graded movements we observe leading up to capture of more distant prey in the light, and implicate somatosensation in captures in the absence of light. We discuss the implications of these findings for future work on the neural control of visually guided behavior in zebrafish."},{"title":"How does the ‘ancient’ asexual Philodina roseola (Rotifera: Bdelloidea) handle potential UVB-induced mutations?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3090","abstract":"Like other obligate asexuals, bdelloid rotifers are expected to suffer from degradation of their genomes through processes including the accumulation of deleterious mutations. However, sequence-based analyses in this regard remain inconclusive. Instead of looking for historical footprints of mutations in these ancient asexuals, we directly examined the susceptibility and ability to repair point mutations by the bdelloid Philodina roseola by inducing cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) via exposure to UVB radiation (280–320 nm). For comparison, we performed analogous experiments with the facultative asexual monogonont rotifer Brachionus rubens. Different strategies were found for the two species. Philodina roseola appeared to shield itself from CPD induction through uncharacterized UV-absorbing compounds and, except for the genome reconstruction that occurs after desiccation, was largely unable to repair UVB-induced damage. By contrast, B. rubens was more susceptible to UVB irradiation, but could repair all induced damage in ~2 h. In addition, whereas UV irradiation had a significant negative impact on the reproductive output of P. roseola, and especially so after desiccation, that of B. rubens was unaffected. Although the strategy of P. roseola might suffice under natural conditions where UVB irradiation is less intense, the lack of any immediate CPD repair mechanisms in this species remains perplexing. It remains to be investigated how typical these results are for bdelloids as a group and therefore how reliant these animals are on desiccation-dependent genome repair to correct potential DNA damage given their obligate asexual lifestyle."},{"title":"Pectoral fins aid in navigation of a complex environment by bluegill sunfish under sensory deprivation conditions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3084","abstract":"Complex structured environments offer fish advantages as places of refuge and areas of greater potential prey densities, but maneuvering through these environments is a navigational challenge. To successfully navigate complex habitats, fish must have sensory input relaying information about the proximity and size of obstacles. We investigated the role of the pectoral fins as mechanosensors in bluegill sunfish swimming through obstacle courses under different sensory deprivation and flow speed conditions. Sensory deprivation was accomplished by filming in the dark to remove visual input and/or temporarily blocking lateral line input via immersion in cobalt chloride. Fish used their pectoral fins to touch obstacles as they swam slowly past them under all conditions. Loss of visual and/or lateral line sensory input resulted in an increased number of fin taps and shorter tap durations while traversing the course. Propulsive pectoral fin strokes were made in open areas between obstacle posts and fish did not use the pectoral fins to push off or change heading. Bending of the flexible pectoral fin rays may initiate an afferent sensory input, which could be an important part of the proprioceptive feedback system needed to navigate complex environments. This behavioral evidence suggests that it is possible for unspecialized pectoral fins to act in both a sensory and a propulsive capacity."},{"title":"Fertilisation is not a new beginning: sperm environment affects offspring developmental success","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3104","abstract":"For organisms with complex life histories, the direction and magnitude of phenotypic links among life-history stages can have important ecological and evolutionary effects. While the phenotypic links between mothers and offspring, as well as between larvae and adults, are well recognised, the links between sperm phenotype and offspring phenotype have been less well explored. Here, we used a split-clutch/split-ejaculate design to examine whether the environment that sperm experience affects the subsequent performance of larvae in the broadcast spawning marine invertebrate Galeolaria gemineoa. The environment that sperm experienced affected the developmental success of larvae sired by these sperm; larvae sired by sperm that experienced low salinities had poorer developmental success than larvae sired by sperm that experienced a normal salinity. When we explored the interactive effects of the sperm environment and the larval environment with an orthogonal design, we found an interaction; when sperm and larvae experienced the same environment, performance was generally higher than when the sperm and larval environments differed. These effects could be due to selection on specific sperm phenotypes, phenotypic modification of the sperm or both. Together, our results challenge the traditional notion that sperm are merely transporters of genetic material; instead, significant covariance between sperm and offspring phenotypes exists. Our study adds to a growing list that demonstrates that fertilisation does have a homogenising effect on the phenotype of the zygote, and that events before fertilisation during the gamete phase can carry through to affect performance in later life-history stages."},{"title":"Modulation of environmental light alters reception and production of visual signals in Nile tilapia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3110","abstract":"Signal reception and production form the basis of animal visual communication, and are largely constrained by environmental light.

To chart the effect of environmental light on visual sensitivity and body colouration throughout ontogeny, we measured spectral sensitivity, lens transmission and body pattern reflectance from juvenile and adult Nile tilapia held under two environmental light treatments. Spectral sensitivity in juveniles reared under a broad-spectrum light treatment and a red-shifted light treatment differed mostly at short wavelengths, where the irradiance of the two light treatments differed the most. In contrast, adults held under the same two light treatments did not differ in spectral sensitivity. Lens transmission in both juveniles and adults did not differ significantly between environmental light treatments, indicating that differences in spectral sensitivity of juveniles originated in the retina. Juveniles and adults held under the two environmental light treatments differed in spectral reflectance, and adults transferred to a third, white light treatment differed in spectral reflectance from their counterparts held under the two original treatments. These results demonstrate that environmental light plays a crucial role in shaping signal reception in juveniles and signal production throughout ontogeny, reinforcing the notion that environmental light has the capacity to influence animal communication, and suggesting that the characteristics of environmental light should be considered in models of ecological speciation."},{"title":"Intra- and inter-individual variation in flight direction in a migratory butterfly co-vary with individual mobility","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3156","abstract":"Flight direction is a major component of an animal's migratory success. However, few studies have focused on variation in flight direction both between and within individuals, which is likely to be correlated with other traits implied in migration processes. We report patterns of intra- and inter-individual variation in flight direction in the large white butterfly Pieris brassicae. The presence of inter-individual variation in flight direction for individuals tested in the same conditions suggests that this trait is inherited in P. brassicae and we propose that a rapid loss of migratory skills may exist in the absence of selection for migration. The magnitude of intra-individual variation was negatively correlated to two surrogates of the potential for migration: mobility and wing length. Highly mobile and longed-winged individuals within the same family were found to fly in similar directions, whereas less mobile and short-winged individuals displayed divergent flight direction compared with the average direction of their kin. There was also a negative correlation between the variance to the mean flight direction of a family and its average mobility, but no correlation with wing length. We discuss these issues in terms of the evolution of traits potentially implied in both migration and dispersal in P. brassicae."},{"title":"The effects of caudal fin loss and regeneration on the swimming performance of three cyprinid fish species with different swimming capacities","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3164","abstract":"In nature, the caudal fins of fish species are frequently lost to some extent by aggressive behaviour, predation and diseases. To test whether the swimming performance of fish with different swimming capacities would be differentially affected due to caudal fin loss and regeneration, we investigated the critical swimming speed (Ucrit), swimming metabolic rate (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/216/16/3164/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>), tail beat frequency (fTB) and tail beat amplitude (ATB) after caudal fin loss and regeneration (20 days) in juveniles of three cyprinid fish species: the qingbo (Spinibarbus sinensis; strong swimmer), the common carp (Cyprinus carpio; intermediate swimmer) and the goldfish (Carassius auratus; poor swimmer). The Ucrit values of the caudal-fin-lost qingbo, common carp and goldfish were 49, 32 and 35% significantly lower than those of the control groups, respectively. The maximum tail beat amplitude (ATBmax) (all three fishes), the maximum tail beat frequency (fTBmax) (only the common carp and the goldfish) and/or the active metabolic rate (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/216/16/3164/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/>) (only the common carp) of the caudal-fin-lost fish were significantly higher than those of the control groups. After 20 days of recovery, the caudal fins recovered to 41, 47 and 24% of those of the control groups for the qingbo, the common carp and the goldfish, respectively. However, the Ucrit values of the fin-regenerated qingbo, common carp and goldfish recovered to 86, 91 and 95% of those of the control group, respectively. The caudal-fin-regenerated qingbo and common carp showed a significantly higher ATBmax and fTBmax, respectively, compared with those of the control groups. The qingbo had a higher fTBmax but a lower ATBmax than the common carp and the goldfish, which suggested that a strong swimmer may maintain swimming speed primarily by maintaining a greater fTBmax, for which the caudal fin plays a more important role during swimming, than a poor swimmer. The <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/216/16/3164/embed/inline-graphic-3.gif\"/> of fish (common carp) with a redundant respiratory capacity could increase due to caudal fin loss to meet the increase in energy expenditure required by an increase in fTBmax. In addition, the sustained swimming performance may not be the only selective pressure acting on caudal fin size in these three species, and the present caudal fin size may be a trade-off between sustain swimming performance and other factors (e.g. sexual selection, escape responses)."},{"title":"Testing cognitive navigation in unknown territories: homing pigeons choose different targets","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3123","abstract":"Homing pigeons (Columba livia) are believed to adopt a map-and-compass strategy to find their way home. Surprisingly, to date a clear demonstration of the use of a cognitive map in free-flight experiments is missing. In this study, we investigated whether homing pigeons use a mental map in which – at an unknown release site – their own position, the home loft and a food loft are represented simultaneously. In order to test this, homing pigeons were trained to fly to a 25–30 km distant food loft. A total of 131 hungry and satiated pigeons were then released from an unfamiliar site equidistant from the food loft and the home loft. Their vanishing bearings and homing times were assessed conventionally at four sites, and also their flight tracks from one release site by means of GPS loggers. The vanishing bearings of fed and hungry birds differed significantly at all release sites and a highly significant proportion of hungry birds flew to the food loft, while the fed birds headed home. The GPS experiment revealed a number of pigeons flying very precisely to the food loft, others correcting their flight direction after topography-induced detours. This implies that the pigeons knew their geographical position in relation to the targets, and chose a flight direction according to their locally manipulated needs – clearly the essence of a cognitive navigational map."},{"title":"Visual search in hunting archerfish shares all hallmarks of human performance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3096","abstract":"Archerfish are renowned for shooting down aerial prey with water jets, but nothing is known about how they spot prey items in their richly structured mangrove habitats. We trained archerfish to stably assign the categories ‘target’ and ‘background’ to objects solely on the basis of non-motion cues. Unlike many other hunters, archerfish are able to discriminate a target from its background in the complete absence of either self-motion or relative motion parallax cues and without using stored information about the structure of the background. This allowed us to perform matched tests to compare the ways fish and humans scan stationary visual scenes. In humans, visual search is seen as a doorway to cortical mechanisms of how attention is allocated. Fish lack a cortex and we therefore wondered whether archerfish would differ from humans in how they scan a stationary visual scene. Our matched tests failed to disclose any differences in the dependence of response time distributions, a most sensitive indicator of the search mechanism, on number and complexity of background objects. Median and range of response times depended linearly on the number of background objects and the corresponding effective processing time per item increased similarly – approximately fourfold – in both humans and fish when the task was harder. Archerfish, like humans, also systematically scanned the scenery, starting with the closest object. Taken together, benchmark visual search tasks failed to disclose any difference between archerfish – who lack a cortex – and humans."},{"title":"Genetically and environmentally mediated divergence in lateral line morphology in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3132","abstract":"Fish and other aquatic vertebrates use their mechanosensory lateral line to detect objects and motion in their immediate environment. Differences in lateral line morphology have been extensively characterized among species; however, intraspecific variation remains largely unexplored. In addition, little is known about how environmental factors modify development of lateral line morphology. Predation is one environmental factor that can act both as a selective pressure causing genetic differences between populations, and as a cue during development to induce plastic changes. Here, we test whether variation in the risk of predation within and among populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) influences lateral line morphology. We compared neuromast arrangement in wild-caught guppies from distinct high- and low-predation population pairs to examine patterns associated with differences in predation pressure. To distinguish genetic and environmental influences, we compared neuromast arrangement in guppies from different source populations reared with and without exposure to predator chemical cues. We found that the distribution of neuromasts across the body varies between populations based on both genetic and environmental factors. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate variation in lateral line morphology based on environmental exposure to an ecologically relevant stimulus."},{"title":"Ontogenetic development of magnetic compass orientation in domestic chickens (Gallus gallus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3143","abstract":"Domestic chickens (Gallus gallus) can be trained to search for a social stimulus in a specific magnetic direction, and cryptochrome 1a, found in the retina, has been proposed as a receptor molecule mediating magnetic directions. The present study combines immuno-histochemical and behavioural data to analyse the ontogenetic development of this ability. Newly hatched chicks already have a small amount of cryptochrome 1a in their violet cones; on day 5, the amount of cryptochrome 1a reached the same level as in adult chickens, suggesting that the physical basis for magnetoreception is present. In behavioural tests, however, young chicks 5 to 7 days old failed to show a preference of the training direction; on days 8, 9 and 12, they could be successfully trained to search along a specific magnetic axis. Trained and tested again 1 week later, the chicks that had not shown a directional preference on days 5 to 7 continued to search randomly, while the chicks tested from day 8 onward preferred the correct magnetic axis when tested 1 week later. The observation that the magnetic compass is not functional before day 8 suggests that certain maturation processes in the magnetosensitive system in the brain are not yet complete before that day. The reasons why chicks that have been trained before that day fail to learn the task later remain unclear."},{"title":"Vibrational long-distance communication in the termites Macrotermes natalensis and Odontotermes sp.","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/17/3249","abstract":"Fungus-growing higher termites build long subterranean galleries that lead outwards from the nest to foraging sites. When soldiers are disturbed, they tend to drum with their heads against the substrate and thereby create vibrational alarm signals. The present study aimed at describing these acoustic signals, how they are elicited, produced and perceived, and how these signals propagate within the galleries and nests over long distances in two termite species of the Southern African savannah, Macrotermes natalensis and an Odontotermes sp. The signals consist of trains of pulses with a pulse repetition rate of 10–20 Hz. The galleries have physical features that promote vibrational communication and are used as channels for long-distance communication. In M. natalensis, the signal propagation velocity is ~130 m s−1 and the signals are attenuated by ~0.4 dB per centimetre distance. Nestmates are extremely sensitive to these vibrations with a behavioural threshold amplitude of 0.012 m s−2. Workers respond by a fast retreat into the nest and soldiers are recruited to the source of vibration. Soldiers also start to drum with a reaction time of about 0.3 s, thereby amplifying the intensity of the signal. This social long-distance communication through chains of signal-reamplifying termites results in a relatively slow propagation (1.3 m s−1) of the signal without decrement over distances of several metres."},{"title":"Aluminum exposure impacts brain plasticity and behavior in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3148","abstract":"Aluminum (Al) toxicity occurs frequently in natural aquatic ecosystems as a result of acid deposition and natural weathering processes. Detrimental effects of Al toxicity on aquatic organisms are well known and can have consequences for survival. Fish exposed to Al in low pH waters will experience physiological and neuroendocrine changes that disrupt homeostasis and alter behavior. To investigate the effects of Al exposure on both the brain and behavior, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) kept in water treated with Al (pH 5.7, 0.37±0.04 μmol 1−1 Al) for 2 weeks were compared with fish kept in under control conditions (pH 6.7, <0.04 μmol 1−1 Al). Fish exposed to Al and acidic conditions had increased Al accumulation in the gills and decreased gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity, which impaired osmoregulatory capacity and caused physiological stress, indicated by elevated plasma cortisol and glucose levels. Here we show for the first time that exposure to Al in acidic conditions also impaired learning performance in a maze task. Al toxicity also reduced the expression of NeuroD1 transcript levels in the forebrain of exposed fish. As in mammals, these data show that exposure to chronic stress, such as acidified Al, can reduce neural plasticity during behavioral challenges in salmon, and may impair the ability to cope with new environments."},{"title":"Activation of the immune defence of the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis by different immune elicitors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2902","abstract":"Understanding the outcomes of host–parasite interactions in nature is in high demand as parasites and pathogens are important for several ecological and evolutionary processes. Ecological immunology (ecoimmunology) has a key role in reaching this goal because immune defence is the main physiological barrier against infections. To date, ecoimmunological studies largely lean on measuring constitutive immune defences (components of defence that are always active). However, understanding the role of inducible components of immune function is important as the immune system is largely an inducible defence. Measuring such defences can be complicated as different parasites may activate different immune cascades, and expression of different immune traits may not be independent. We examined the suitability of different immune activation techniques for the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. By experimentally challenging snails with different immune elicitors [injection with snail saline (i.e. wounding), lyophilized Escherichia coli cells, lyophilized Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells, healthy snail gonad, and trematode-infected snail gonad; maintenance in microorganism-enriched water] and measuring phenoloxidase-like and antibacterial activity of their haemolymph, we found increased immune activity against some immune elicitors, but also decreased activity. Our findings suggest potentially complicated relationships among immune traits, and propose suitable techniques for ecological studies in this study system."},{"title":"Skin peptides protect juvenile leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) against chytridiomycosis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2908","abstract":"One issue of great concern for the scientific community is the continuing loss of diverse amphibian species on a global scale. Amphibian populations around the world are experiencing serious losses due to the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This pathogen colonizes the skin, leading to the disruption of ionic balance and eventual cardiac arrest. In many species, antimicrobial peptides secreted into the mucus are thought to contribute to protection against colonization by skin pathogens. Although it is generally thought that antimicrobial peptides are an important component of innate immune defenses against B. dendrobatidis, much of the current evidence relies on correlations between effective antimicrobial peptide defenses and species survival. There have been few studies to directly demonstrate that antimicrobial peptides play a role. Using the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens, we show here that injection of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) brings about a long-term depletion of skin peptides (initial concentrations do not recover until after day 56). When peptide stores recovered, the renewed peptides were similar in composition to the initial peptides as determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and in activity against B. dendrobatidis as determined by growth inhibition assays. Newly metamorphosed froglets depleted of their peptide stores and exposed to B. dendrobatidis died more rapidly than B. dendrobatidis-exposed froglets with their peptides intact. Thus, antimicrobial peptides in the skin mucus appear to provide some resistance to B. dendrobatidis infections, and it is important for biologists to recognize that this defense is especially important for newly metamorphosed frogs in which the adaptive immune system is still immature."},{"title":"Modulation of Rh glycoproteins, ammonia excretion and Na+ fluxes in three freshwater teleosts when exposed chronically to high environmental ammonia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2917","abstract":"We investigated relationships among branchial unidirectional Na+ fluxes, ammonia excretion, urea excretion, plasma ammonia, plasma cortisol, and gill transporter expression and function in three freshwater fish differing in their sensitivity to high environmental ammonia (HEA).

Expression of Rhbg, Rhcg (Rhcg-a and Rhcg-b), H+-ATPase (V-type, B-subunit) and Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) mRNA was upregulated in goldfish, Rhcg-a and NKA in carp, and Rhcg2, NHE-2 (Na+/H+ exchanger) and H+-ATPase in trout. Branchial H+-ATPase activity was elevated in goldfish and trout, and NKA activity in goldfish and carp, but NKA did not appear to function preferentially as a Na+/NH4+-ATPase in any species. Goldfish alone increased urea excretion rate during HEA, in concert with elevated urea transporter mRNA expression in gills. Overall, goldfish showed more effective compensatory responses towards HEA than carp, while trout were least effective."},{"title":"Heat-stress survival in the pre-adult stage of the life cycle in an intercontinental set of recombinant inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2953","abstract":"In insects, pre-adult stages of the life cycle are exposed to variation in temperature that may differ from that in adults.

Here, we tested quantitative trait loci (QTL) for heat-stress survival in larvae of Drosophila melanogaster, with and without a mild-heat-stress pre-treatment. Two sets of recombinant inbred lines derived from lines artificially selected for high and low levels of knockdown resistance to high temperature in young flies were used as the mapping population. There was no apparent increase in heat-shock survival between heat-pretreated and non-pretreated larvae. There was a positive correlation between the two experimental conditions of heat-shock survival (with and without a heat pre-treatment) except for males from one set of lines. Several QTL were identified involving all three major chromosomes. Most QTL for larval thermotolerance overlapped with thermotolerance QTL identified in previous studies for adults, indicating that heat-stress resistance is not genetically independent between life cycle stages because of either linkage or pleiotropy. The sign of the effects of some QTL alleles differed both between the sexes and between life stages."},{"title":"Effects of fluvalinate on honey bee learning, memory, responsiveness to sucrose, and survival","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2931","abstract":"Contaminants can affect organisms' behaviour and, as a consequence, survival. Tau-fluvalinate (hereafter fluvalinate) is the active ingredient in a pesticide commonly used in North America to control Varroa destructor mites in honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies. Fluvalinate's effects on honey bees are not well known. Honey bee cognitive and neural function can be assessed using the proboscis extension reflex (PER), which applies Pavlovian conditioning techniques. This study used PER to evaluate effects of fluvalinate on honey bee acquisition learning, (long-term) memory recall, responsiveness to sucrose, and mortality. We also evaluated how exclusion criteria for honey bees that did not exhibit PER during training and memory trials affected interpretation of results. Fluvalinate was administered both orally and dermally at high and low doses to mimic routes by which honey bees are exposed. We found negative effects of fluvalinate on honey bee learning, memory, responsiveness to sucrose, and survival, especially in high oral doses. We also found significant consequences to interpretation of results using different exclusion criteria. For example, almost 50% of individuals that failed to show evidence of learning subsequently showed evidence of memory. The latter results have important implications regarding traditional assessment of PER-based learning and memory; the former results suggest that evaluation of honey bee exposure to fluvalinate and attendant consequences warrants further investigation."},{"title":"Climate influences thermal balance and water use in African and Asian elephants: physiology can predict drivers of elephant distribution","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2939","abstract":"Elephant movement patterns in relation to surface water demonstrate that they are a water-dependent species. Thus, there has been interest in using surface water management to mitigate problems associated with localized elephant overabundance. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying the elephant's water dependence remain unclear. Although thermoregulation is likely an important driver, the relationship between thermoregulation, water use and climate has not been quantified. We measured skin surface temperature of and cutaneous water loss from 13 elephants (seven African, 3768±642 kg; six Asian, 3834±498 kg) and determined the contribution of evaporative cooling to their thermal and water budgets across a range of air temperatures (8–33°C). We also measured respiratory evaporative water loss and resting metabolic heat production on a subset of elephants (N=7). The rate of cutaneous evaporative water loss ranged between 0.31 and 8.9 g min−1 m−2 for Asian elephants and 0.26 and 6.5 g min−1 m−2 for African elephants. Simulated thermal and water budgets using climate data from Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and Okaukuejo, Namibia, suggested that the 24-h evaporative cooling water debt incurred in warm climates can be more than 4.5 times that incurred in mesic climates. This study confirms elephants are obligate evaporative coolers but suggests that classification of elephants as water dependent is insufficient given the importance of climate in determining the magnitude of this dependence. These data highlight the potential for a physiological modeling approach to predicting the utility of surface water management for specific populations."},{"title":"Artificial activation of mature unfertilized eggs in the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles stephensi (Diptera, Culicidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2960","abstract":"In the past decade, many transgenic lines of mosquitoes have been generated and analyzed, whereas the maintenance of a large number of transgenic lines requires a great deal of effort and cost. In vitro fertilization by an injection of cryopreserved sperm into eggs has been proven to be effective for the maintenance of strains in mammals. The technique of artificial egg activation is a prerequisite for the establishment of in vitro fertilization by sperm injection. We demonstrated that artificial egg activation is feasible in the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles stephensi (Diptera, Culicidae). Nearly 100% of eggs dissected from virgin females immersed in distilled water darkened, similar to normally oviposited fertilized eggs. It was revealed by the cytological examination of chromosomes that meiotic arrest was relieved in these eggs approximately 20 min after incubation in water. Biochemical examinations revealed that MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase) and MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase) were dephosphorylated similar to that in fertilized eggs. These results indicate that dissected unfertilized eggs were activated in distilled water and started development. Injection of distilled water into body cavity of the virgin blood-fed females also induced activation of a portion of eggs in the ovaries. The technique of artificial egg activation is expected to contribute to the success of in vitro fertilization in A. stephensi."},{"title":"Colour vision and response bias in a coral reef fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2967","abstract":"Animals use coloured signals for a variety of communication purposes, including to attract potential mates, recognize individuals, defend territories and warn predators of secondary defences (aposematism). To understand the mechanisms that drive the evolution and design of such visual signals, it is important to understand the visual systems and potential response biases of signal receivers. Here, we provide raw data on the spectral capabilities of a coral reef fish, the Picasso triggerfish Rhinecanthus aculeatus, which is potentially trichromatic with three cone sensitivities of 413 nm (single cone), 480 nm (double cone, medium sensitivity) and 528 nm (double cone, long sensitivity), and a rod sensitivity of 498 nm. The ocular media have a 50% transmission cut off at 405 nm. Behavioural experiments confirmed colour vision over their spectral range; triggerfish were significantly more likely to choose coloured stimuli over grey distractors, irrespective of luminance. We then examined whether response biases existed towards coloured and patterned stimuli to provide insight into how visual signals – in particular, aposematic colouration – may evolve. Triggerfish showed a preferential foraging response bias to red and green stimuli, in contrast to blue and yellow, irrespective of pattern. There was no response bias to patterned over monochromatic non-patterned stimuli. A foraging response bias towards red in fish differs from that of avian predators, who often avoid red food items. Red is frequently associated with warning colouration in terrestrial environments (ladybirds, snakes, frogs), whilst blue is used in aquatic environments (blue-ringed octopus, nudibranchs); whether the design of warning (aposematic) displays is a cause or consequence of response biases is unclear."},{"title":"Power output of skinned skeletal muscle fibres from the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2974","abstract":"Muscle samples were taken from the gluteus, semitendinosus and longissimus muscles of a captive cheetah immediately after euthanasia. Fibres were ‘skinned’ to remove all membranes, leaving the contractile filament array intact and functional. Segments of skinned fibres from these cheetah muscles and from rabbit psoas muscle were activated at 20°C by a temperature-jump protocol. Step and ramp length changes were imposed after active stress had developed. The stiffness of the non-contractile ends of the fibres (series elastic component) was measured at two different stress values in each fibre; stiffness was strongly dependent on stress. Using these stiffness values, the speed of shortening of the contractile component was evaluated, and hence the power it was producing. Fibres were analysed for myosin heavy chain content using gel electrophoresis, and identified as either slow (type I) or fast (type II). The power output of cheetah type II fibre segments was 92.5±4.3 W kg−1 (mean ± s.e., 14 fibres) during shortening at relative stress 0.15 (the stress during shortening/isometric stress). For rabbit psoas fibre segments (presumably type IIX) the corresponding value was significantly higher (P<0.001), 119.7±6.2 W kg−1 (mean ± s.e., 7 fibres). These values are our best estimates of the maximum power output under the conditions used here. Thus, the contractile filament power from cheetah was less than that of rabbit when maximally activated at 20°C, and does not account for the superior locomotor performance of the cheetah."},{"title":"X-ray motion analysis of the vertebral column during the startle response in striped bass, Morone saxatilis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2833","abstract":"Whole-body stiffness has a substantial impact on propulsive wave speed during axial undulatory locomotion in fishes. The connective tissues of the vertebral column may contribute to body stiffness, but without mechanical and kinematic analysis it is unclear whether the in vivo range of motion of intervertebral joints (IVJs) is great enough to stress IVJ tissues, thus generating stiffness. The present study used 2D videoradiography and 3D X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM) to quantify vertebral kinematics during the startle response in striped bass (Morone saxatilis). X-ray video revealed two distinct patterns of bending: pattern I begins in the abdominal region and then proceeds to maximum IVJ angles in the caudal region, whereas pattern II begins in the cervical region and proceeds to maximum IVJ angles in the abdominal and then the caudal joints. In pattern II bends, the cervical joints exhibit a greater in vivo range of motion than previously reported in other species. XROMM analysis of caudal IVJs suggests primarily lateral bending: mean axial and dorsoventral rotations were less than 2 deg and inconsistent across 51 sequences analyzed from five individuals, whereas mean maximum lateral bending angles were 10.4±3.57 deg. These angles, combined with previous investigations of mechanical properties, reveal that the maximum angles all occur within the neutral zone of bending, indicating that little stress is experienced about the joint. This suggests that the IVJs of striped bass are quite compliant and likely do not contribute significantly to whole-body stiffness or elastic recoil during swimming in vivo."},{"title":"The hydrodynamics of contact of a marine larva, Bugula neritina, with a cylinder","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2789","abstract":"Marine larvae are often considered as drifters that collide with larval collectors as passive particles. The trajectories of Bugula neritina larvae and of polystyrene beads were recorded in the velocity field of a vertical cylinder. The experiments illustrated that the trajectories of larvae and of beads may differ markedly. By considering a larva as a self-propelled mechanical microswimmer, a mathematical model of its motion in the two-dimensional velocity field of a long cylinder was formulated. Simulated larval trajectories were compared with experimental observations. We calculated the ratio η of the probability of contact of a microswimmer with a cylinder to the probability of contact of a passive particle with the cylinder. We found that depending on the ratio S of the swimming velocity of the microswimmer to the velocity of the ambient current, the probability of contact of a microswimmer with a collector may be orders of magnitude larger than the probability of contact of a passive particle with the cylinder: for S≈0.01, η≈1; for S≈0.1, η≈10; and for S≈1, η≈100."},{"title":"Role of the iridescent eye in stickleback female mate choice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2806","abstract":"Many vertebrates exhibit prominent body colours that are used in courtship and territorial communication. Some fishes also have an eye whose iris becomes iridescent during the mating season, as in the threespine stickleback. Behavioural studies in this species have focused on the redness of the throat/jaw as the primary determinant of female mate choice. Unlike the iridescent eye, however, the red throat/jaw is not present in all stickleback populations, suggesting that the colour of the eye may be equally important for female mate choice. Here, we used data on photoreceptors and environmental light to assess body conspicuousness and the colour contrast of courtship signals for stickleback populations living in a range of waters, from clear (mesotrophic) to red light shifted (dystrophic). This analysis indicated that the redness of the throat/jaw is expressed to enhance the contrast of the eye. To test the importance of eye colour as a courtship signal, we carried out mate choice experiments in which females were presented with identical videos of a courting male but for the colour of the eye and/or the throat/jaw. Females did not choose based on differences in throat/jaw redness between videos, but preferred males with the highest contrast between the eye and the throat/jaw. This result points to the blue iridescent eye as a primary courtship signal in stickleback female mate choice."},{"title":"Oceanic navigation in Cory's shearwaters: evidence for a crucial role of olfactory cues for homing after displacement","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2798","abstract":"Pelagic birds, which wander in the open sea most of the year and often nest on small remote oceanic islands, are able to pinpoint their breeding colony even within an apparently featureless environment, such as the open ocean. The mechanisms underlying their surprising navigational performance are still unknown. In order to investigate the nature of the cues exploited for oceanic navigation, Cory's shearwaters, Calonectris borealis, nesting in the Azores were displaced and released in open ocean at about 800 km from their colony, after being subjected to sensory manipulation. While magnetically disturbed shearwaters showed unaltered navigational performance and behaved similarly to unmanipulated control birds, the shearwaters deprived of their sense of smell were dramatically impaired in orientation and homing. Our data show that seabirds use olfactory cues not only to find their food but also to navigate over vast distances in the ocean."},{"title":"Stress and death of cnidarian host cells play a role in cnidarian bleaching","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2813","abstract":"Coral bleaching occurs when there is a breakdown of the symbiosis between cnidarian hosts and resident Symbiodinium spp. Multiple mechanisms for the bleaching process have been identified, including apoptosis and autophagy, and most previous work has focused on the Symbiodinium cell as the initiator of the bleaching cascade. In this work we show that it is possible for host cells to initiate apoptosis that can contribute to death of the Symbiodinium cell. First we found that colchicine, which results in apoptosis in other animals, causes cell death in the model anemone Aiptasia sp. but not in cultured Symbiodinium CCMP-830 cells or in cells freshly isolated from host Aiptasia (at least within the time frame of our study). In contrast, when symbiotic Aiptasia were incubated in colchicine, cell death in the resident Symbiodinium cells was observed, suggesting a host effect on symbiont mortality. Using live-cell confocal imaging of macerated symbiotic host cell isolates, we identified a pattern where the initiation of host cell death was followed by mortality of the resident Symbiodinium cells. This same pattern was observed in symbiotic host cells that were subjected to temperature stress. This research suggests that mortality of symbionts during temperature-induced bleaching can be initiated in part by host cell apoptosis."},{"title":"Nitrogen metabolism of the intestine during digestion in a teleost fish, the plainfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2821","abstract":"Digestion affects nitrogen metabolism in fish, as both exogenous and endogenous proteins and amino acids are catabolized, liberating ammonia in the process. Here we present a model of local detoxification of ammonia by the intestinal tissue of the plainfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus) during digestion, resulting in an increase in urea excretion of gastrointestinal origin. Corroborating evidence indicated whole-animal ammonia and urea excretion increased following feeding, and ammonia levels within the lumen of the midshipman intestine increased to high levels (1.8±0.4 μmol N g−1). We propose that this ammonia entered the enterocytes and was detoxified to urea via the ornithine-urea cycle (O-UC) enzymes, as evidenced by a 1.5- to 2.9-fold post-prandial increase in glutamine synthetase activity (0.14±0.05 and 0.28±0.02 μmol min−1 g−1 versus 0.41±0.03 μmol min−1 g−1) and an 8.7-fold increase in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase III activity (0.3±1.2 versus 2.6±0.4 nmol min−1 g−1). Furthermore, digestion increased urea production by isolated gastrointestinal tissue 1.7-fold, supporting our hypothesis that intestinal tissue synthesizes urea in response to feeding. We further propose that the intestinal urea may have been excreted into the intestinal lumen via an apical urea transporter as visualized using immunohistochemistry. A portion of the urea was then excreted to the environment along with the feces, resulting in the observed increase in urea excretion, while another portion may have been used by intestinal ureolytic bacteria. Overall, we propose that P. notatus produces urea within the enterocytes via a functional O-UC, which is then excreted into the intestinal lumen. Our model of intestinal nitrogen metabolism does not appear to be universal as we were unab le to activate the O-UC in the intestine of fed rainbow trout. However, literature values suggest that multiple fish species could follow this model."},{"title":"An SLC6 transporter of the novel B0,− system aids in absorption and detection of nutrient amino acids in Caenorhabditis elegans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2843","abstract":"Nutrient amino acid transporters (NATs) of solute carrier family 6 (SLC6) mediate uptake of essential amino acids in mammals and insects. Phylogenomic analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce) SLC6 family identifies five genes paralogous to an insect-specific NAT subfamily. Here we cloned and characterized the first representative of the identified nematode-specific transporters, SNF-5. SNF-5 mediates broad spectrum cation-coupled transport of neutral amino acids with submillimolar affinities and stoichiometry of 1 AA:1 Na+, except for 1 l-Pro:2 Na+. Unexpectedly, it transports acidic l-Glu− and l-Asp− (1 AA−:3 Na+), revealing it to be the first member of a new B0,− system among characterized SLC6 transporters. This activity correlates with a unique positively charged His+ 377 in the substrate-binding pocket. snf-5 promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein labels intestinal cells INT1-9 and three pairs of amphid sensory neurons: ASI, ADF and ASK. These cells are intimately involved in control of dauer diapause, development, metabolism and longevity. The snf-5 deletion mutants do not show apparent morphological disorders, but increase dauer formation while reducing dauer maintenance upon starvation. Overall, the present study characterized the first nematode-specific NAT and revealed important structural and functional aspects of this transporter. In addition to the predictable role in alimentary amino acid absorption, our results indicate possible neuronal roles of SNF-5 as an amino acid provider to specific neuronal functions, including sensing of amino acid availability."},{"title":"Thermal physiology of the fingered limpet Lottia digitalis under emersion and immersion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2858","abstract":"Marine animals living high in the rocky intertidal zone experience long durations of aerial emersion, sometimes enduring rapid increases in temperature. To date, much of our understanding of the thermal physiology of intertidal organisms comes from studies in which organisms are exposed to increasing temperatures when immersed, with the added effect of aerial emersion rarely considered. In this study, we examined the physiological response of the finger limpet, Lottia digitalis, to increases in temperature under both immersed and emersed conditions. We investigated the thermal sensitivity and upper temperature tolerance of limpets through assessment of cardiac performance, metabolic rate, glycogen depletion and maintenance of protein integrity. Cardiac performance in response to ecologically relevant increases in temperature was similar in emersed and immersed limpets from 15 to 35°C and showed multiple break patterns in heart rate as temperature was increased. Overall, emersed limpets had a greater upper thermal limit on cardiac performance, with the ability to maintain heart rate at a temperature 3–5°C higher than that for immersed limpets. Metabolism in limpets also differed significantly between emersion and immersion, where a significant depression in aerobic metabolic rate was observed under immersion with increasing temperature. Greater levels of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were found under emersed conditions compared with immersed limpets. Maintaining cardiac performance and aerobic metabolism to higher temperatures under emersed conditions is likely reflective of physiological adaptations to live in an aerially exposed environment. Measured field temperatures where fingered limpets were collected demonstrated that limpets have a narrow thermal safety margin for aerobic performance, and currently experience multiple days where summer temperatures might exceed their threshold limits."},{"title":"Physiological adaptations to reproduction. II. Mitochondrial adjustments in livers of lactating mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2889","abstract":"Reproduction imposes significant costs and is characterized by an increased energy demand. As a consequence, individuals adjust their cellular structure and function in response to this physiological constraint. Because mitochondria are central to energy production, changes in their functional properties are likely to occur during reproduction. Such changes could cause adjustments in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and consequently in oxidative stress levels. In this study, we investigated several mechanisms involved in energy production, including mitochondrial respiration at different steps of the electron transport system (ETS) and related the results to citrate synthase activity in the liver of non-reproductive and reproductive (two and eight pups) female house mice at peak lactation. Whereas we did not find differences between females having different litter sizes, liver mitochondria of reproductive females showed lower ETS activity and an increase in mitochondrial density when compared with the non-reproductive females. Although it is possible that these changes were due to combined processes involved in reproduction and not to the relative investment in lactation, we propose that the mitochondrial adjustment in liver might help to spare substrates and therefore energy for milk production in the mammary gland. Moreover, our results suggest that these changes lead to an increase in ROS production that subsequently upregulates antioxidant defence activity and decreases oxidative stress."},{"title":"Physiological adaptations to reproduction. I. Experimentally increasing litter size enhances aspects of antioxidant defence but does not cause oxidative damage in mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2879","abstract":"Life history theory suggests that investment in reproduction can trade off against growth, longevity and both reproduction and performance later in life. One possible reason for this trade-off is that reproduction directly causes somatic damage. Oxidative stress, an overproduction of reactive oxygen species in relation to cellular defences, can correlate with reproductive investment and has been implicated as a pathway leading to senescence. This has led to the suggestion that this aspect of physiology could be an important mechanism underlying the trade-off between reproduction and lifespan. We manipulated female reproductive investment to test whether oxidative stress increases with reproduction in mice. Each female's pups were cross-fostered to produce litters of either two or eight, representing low and high levels of reproductive investment for wild mice. No differences were observed between reproductive groups at peak lactation for several markers of oxidative stress in the heart and gastrocnemius muscle. Surprisingly, oxidative damage to proteins was lower in the livers of females with a litter size of eight than in females with two pups or non-reproductive control females. While protein oxidation decreased, activity levels of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase increased in the liver, suggesting this may be one pathway used to protect against oxidative stress. Our results highlight the need for caution when interpreting correlative relationships and suggest that oxidative stress does not increase with enhanced reproductive effort during lactation."},{"title":"Prolonged fasting activates Nrf2 in post-weaned elephant seals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2870","abstract":"Elephant seals naturally experience prolonged periods of absolute food and water deprivation (fasting). In humans, rats and mice, prolonged food deprivation activates the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) and increases oxidative damage. In elephant seals, prolonged fasting activates RAS without increasing oxidative damage likely due to an increase in antioxidant defenses. The mechanism leading to the upregulation of antioxidant defenses during prolonged fasting remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated whether prolonged fasting activates the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2, which controls the expression of antioxidant genes, and if such activation is potentially mediated by systemic increases in RAS. Blood and skeletal muscle samples were collected from seals fasting for 1, 3, 5 and 7 weeks. Nrf2 activity and nuclear content increased by 76% and 167% at week 7. Plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) were 5000% and 250% higher at week 7 than at week 1. Phosphorylation of Smad2, an effector of Ang II and TGF signaling, increased by 120% at week 7 and by 84% in response to intravenously infused Ang II. NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) mRNA expression, which is controlled by smad proteins, increased 430% at week 7, while Nox4 protein expression, which can activate Nrf2, was 170% higher at week 7 than at week 1. These results demonstrate that prolonged fasting activates Nrf2 in elephant seals and that RAS stimulation can potentially result in increased Nox4 through Smad phosphorylation. The results also suggest that Nox4 is essential to sustain the hormetic adaptive response to oxidative stress in fasting seals."},{"title":"Flies developed small bodies and small cells in warm and in thermally fluctuating environments","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/15/2896","abstract":"Although plasma membranes benefit cells by regulating the flux of materials to and from the environment, these membranes cost energy to maintain. Because smaller cells provide relatively more membrane area for transport, ectotherms that develop in warm environments should consist of small cells despite the energetic cost. Effects of constant temperatures on cell size qualitatively match this prediction, but effects of thermal fluctuations on cell size are unknown. Thermal fluctuations could favour either small or large cells; small cells facilitate transport during peaks in metabolic demand whereas large cells minimize the resources needed for homeoviscous adaptation. To explore this problem, we examined effects of thermal fluctuations during development on the size of epidermal cells in the wings of Drosophila melanogaster. Flies derived from a temperate population were raised at two mean temperatures (18 and 25°C), with either no variation or a daily variation of ±4°C. Flies developed faster at a mean temperature of 25°C. Thermal fluctuations sped development, but only at 18°C. An increase in the mean and variance of temperature caused flies to develop smaller cells and wings. Thermal fluctuations reduced the size of males at 18°C and the size of females at 25°C. The thorax, the wings and the cells decreased with an increase in the mean and in the variance of temperature, but the response of cells was the strongest. Based on this pattern, we hypothesize that development of the greater area of membranes under thermal fluctuations provides a metabolic advantage that outweighs the greater energetic cost of remodelling membranes."},{"title":"The effects of elevated temperature on the sexual traits, immunology and survivorship of a tropical ectotherm","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2658","abstract":"In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected an average global air temperature increase of 1.1–6.4°C by the end of the 21st century. Although the tropics are predicted to experience less extreme temperature increases than regions of higher latitude, tropical ectotherms live close to their thermal limits, and are thus particularly vulnerable to increases in temperature. In this study, we examined how predicted patterns of global warming will affect survival and sexual traits in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Guppies were exposed from birth to one of four temperature treatments: 23, 25 (control), 28 or 30°C. We measured brood survival and, at sexual maturity, male ornamentation, sperm traits and immune response. Our results show that increases in temperature result in guppies that have shorter, slower sperm but that there is an optimum temperature for ornamental hue at 28°C. Given the importance of sperm quality for reproduction, these results suggest population viability could be affected by warming. However, we found no difference in brood survival or immune response to a novel antigen across the treatments, indicating that survival may not be as vulnerable as previously thought. Overall, our data suggest that male sexual traits, and in particular sperm performance, are more sensitive than survival to a warming environment."},{"title":"Jumping mechanisms in gum treehopper insects (Hemiptera, Eurymelinae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2682","abstract":"Jumping in a species of Australian gum treehopper was analysed from high-speed images. Pauroeurymela amplicincta adults and nymphs lived together in groups that were tended by ants, but only adults jumped. The winged adults with a body mass of 23 mg and a body length of 7 mm had some morphological characteristics intermediate between those of their close relatives the leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) and the treehoppers (Membracidae). They, like leafhoppers, lacked the prominent prothoracic helmets of membracid treehoppers, and their large hind coxae were linked by press studs (poppers), that are present in leafhoppers but not treehoppers. The hindlegs were only 30–40% longer than the other legs and 67% of body length. They are thus of similar proportion to the hindlegs of treehoppers but much shorter than those of most leafhoppers. Jumping was propelled by the hindlegs, which moved in the same plane as each other beneath and almost parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body. A jump was preceded by full levation of the coxo-trochanteral joints of the hindlegs. In its best jumps, the rapid depression of these joints then accelerated the insect in 1.4 ms to a take-off velocity of 3.8 m s−1 so that it experienced a force of almost 280 g. In 22% of jumps, the wings opened before take-off but did not flap until the gum treehopper was airborne, when the body rotated little in any plane. The energy expended was 170 μJ, the power output was 122 mW and the force exerted was 64 mN. Such jumps are predicted to propel the insect forwards 1450 mm (200 times body length) and to a height of 430 mm if there is no effect of wind resistance. The power output per mass of jumping muscle far exceeded the maximum active contractile limit of muscle and indicates that a catapult-like action must be used. This eurymelid therefore out-performs both leafhoppers and treehoppers in i ts faster acceleration and in its higher take-off velocity."},{"title":"Heart rate and estimated energy expenditure of flapping and gliding in black-browed albatrosses","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/16/3175","abstract":"Albatrosses are known to expend only a small amount of energy during flight. The low energy cost of albatross flight has been attributed to energy-efficient gliding (soaring) with sporadic flapping, although little is known about how much time and energy albatrosses expend in flapping versus gliding during cruising flight. Here, we examined the heart rates (used as an instantaneous index of energy expenditure) and flapping activities of free-ranging black-browed albatrosses (Thalassarche melanophrys) to estimate the energy cost of flapping as well as time spent in flapping activities. The heart rate of albatrosses during flight (144 beats min−1) was similar to that while sitting on the water (150 beats min−1). In contrast, heart rate was much higher during takeoff and landing (ca. 200 beats min−1). Heart rate during cruising flight was linearly correlated with the number of wing flaps per minute, suggesting an extra energy burden of flapping. Albatrosses spend only 4.6±1.4% of their time flapping during cruising flight, which was significantly lower than during and shortly after takeoff (9.8±3.5%). Flapping activity, which amounted to just 4.6% of the time in flight, accounted for 13.3% of the total energy expenditure during cruising flight. These results support the idea that albatrosses achieve energy-efficient flight by reducing the time spent in flapping activity, which is associated with high energy expenditure."},{"title":"Novel muscle and connective tissue design enables high extensibility and controls engulfment volume in lunge-feeding rorqual whales","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2691","abstract":"Muscle serves a wide variety of mechanical functions during animal feeding and locomotion, but the performance of this tissue is limited by how far it can be extended. In rorqual whales, feeding and locomotion are integrated in a dynamic process called lunge feeding, where an enormous volume of prey-laden water is engulfed into a capacious ventral oropharyngeal cavity that is bounded superficially by skeletal muscle and ventral groove blubber (VGB). The great expansion of the cavity wall presents a mechanical challenge for the physiological limits of skeletal muscle, yet its role is considered fundamental in controlling the flux of water into the mouth. Our analyses of the functional properties and mechanical behaviour of VGB muscles revealed a crimped microstructure in an unstrained, non-feeding state that is arranged in parallel with dense and straight elastin fibres. This allows the muscles to accommodate large tissue deformations of the VGB yet still operate within the known strain limits of vertebrate skeletal muscle. VGB transverse strains in routine-feeding rorquals were substantially less than those observed in dead ones, where decomposition gas stretched the VGB to its elastic limit, evidence supporting the idea that eccentric muscle contraction modulates the rate of expansion and ultimate size of the ventral cavity during engulfment."},{"title":"On the methodological limitations of detecting oxidative stress: effects of paraquat on measures of oxidative status in greenfinches","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2713","abstract":"Oxidative stress (OS) is widely believed to be responsible for the generation of trade-offs in evolutionary ecology by means of constraining investment into a number of components of fitness. Yet, progress in understanding the true role of OS in ecology and evolution has remained elusive. Interpretation of current findings is particularly hampered by the scarcity of experiments demonstrating which of the many available parameters of oxidative status respond most sensitively to and are relevant for measuring OS. We addressed these questions in wild-caught captive greenfinches (Carduelis chloris) by experimental induction of OS by administration of the pro-oxidant compound paraquat with drinking water. Treatment induced 50% mortality, a significant drop in body mass and an increase in oxidative DNA damage and glutathione levels in erythrocytes among the survivors of the high paraquat (0.2 g l−1 over 7 days) group. Samples taken 3 days after the end of paraquat treatment showed no effect on the peroxidation of lipids (plasma malondialdehyde), carbonylation of proteins (in erythrocytes), parameters of plasma antioxidant protection (total antioxidant capacity and oxygen radical absorbance), uric acid or carotenoids. Our findings of an increase in one marker of damage and one marker of protection from the multitude of measured variables indicate that detection of OS is difficult even under the most stringent experimental induction of oxidative insult. We hope that this study highlights the need for reconsideration of over-simplistic models of OS and draws attention to the limitations of detection of OS due to time-lagged and hormetic upregulation of protective mechanisms. This study also underpins the diagnostic value of measurement of oxidative damage to DNA bases and assessment of erythrocyte glutathione levels."},{"title":"A thermogenic secondary sexual character in male sea lamprey","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2702","abstract":"Secondary sexual characters in animals are exaggerated ornaments or weapons for intrasexual competition. Unexpectedly, we found that a male secondary sexual character in sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is a thermogenic adipose tissue that instantly increases its heat production during sexual encounters. This secondary sexual character, developed in front of the anterior dorsal fin of mature males, is a swollen dorsal ridge known as the ‘rope’ tissue. It contains nerve bundles, multivacuolar adipocytes and interstitial cells packed with small lipid droplets and mitochondria with dense and highly organized cristae. The fatty acid composition of the rope tissue is rich in unsaturated fatty acids. The cytochrome c oxidase activity is high but the ATP concentration is very low in the mitochondria of the rope tissue compared with those of the gill and muscle tissues. The rope tissue temperature immediately rose up to 0.3°C when the male encountered a conspecific. Mature males generated more heat in the rope and muscle tissues when presented with a mature female than when presented with a male (paired t-test, P<0.05). On average, the rope generated 0.027±0.013 W cm−3 more heat than the muscle in 10 min. Transcriptome analyses revealed that genes involved in fat cell differentiation are upregulated whereas those involved in oxidative-phosphorylation-coupled ATP synthesis are downregulated in the rope tissue compared with the gill and muscle tissues. Sexually mature male sea lamprey possess the only known thermogenic secondary sexual character that shows differential heat generation toward individual conspecifics."},{"title":"Mechanical and energetic consequences of rolling foot shape in human walking","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2722","abstract":"During human walking, the center of pressure under the foot progresses forward smoothly during each step, creating a wheel-like motion between the leg and the ground. This rolling motion might appear to aid walking economy, but the mechanisms that may lead to such a benefit are unclear, as the leg is not literally a wheel. We propose that there is indeed a benefit, but less from rolling than from smoother transitions between pendulum-like stance legs. The velocity of the body center of mass (COM) must be redirected in that transition, and a longer foot reduces the work required for the redirection. Here we develop a dynamic walking model that predicts different effects from altering foot length as opposed to foot radius, and test it by attaching rigid, arc-like foot bottoms to humans walking with fixed ankles. The model suggests that smooth rolling is relatively insensitive to arc radius, whereas work for the step-to-step transition decreases approximately quadratically with foot length. We measured the separate effects of arc-foot length and radius on COM velocity fluctuations, work performed by the legs and metabolic cost. Experimental data (N=8) show that foot length indeed has much greater effect on both the mechanical work of the step-to-step transition (23% variation, P=0.04) and the overall energetic cost of walking (6%, P=0.03) than foot radius (no significant effect, P>0.05). We found the minimum metabolic energy cost for an arc foot length of approximately 29% of leg length, roughly comparable to human foot length. Our results suggest that the foot's apparently wheel-like action derives less benefit from rolling per se than from reduced work to redirect the body COM."},{"title":"Soil salinity increases survival of freezing in the enchytraeid Enchytraeus albidus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2732","abstract":"Enchytraeus albidus is a freeze-tolerant enchytraeid found in diverse habitats, ranging from supralittoral to terrestrial and spanning temperate to arctic regions. Its freeze tolerance is well known but the effect of salinity in this strategy is still poorly understood. We therefore studied the combined effect of salinity (0, 15, 35, 50‰ NaCl) and sub-zero temperatures (−5, −14, −20°C) on the freeze tolerance of E. albidus collected from two distinct geographical regions (Greenland and Germany). A full factorial design was used to study survival, and physiological and biochemical end points. The effect of salinity on the reproduction of German E. albidus was also assessed. Exposure for 48 h to saline soils prior to cold exposure triggered an increase in osmolality and decrease in water content. Worms exposed to saline soils had an improved survival of freezing compared to worms frozen in non-saline soils, particularly at −20°C (survival more than doubled). Differential scanning calorimetry measurements showed that the fraction of water frozen at −5 and −14°C was lower in worms exposed to 35‰ NaCl than in control worms. The lowering of ice content by exposure to saline soils was probably the main explanation for the better freeze survival in saline-exposed worms. Glucose increased with decreasing temperature, but was lower in saline than in non-saline soils. Thus, glucose accumulation patterns did not explain differences in freeze survival. Overall, the physiological responses to freezing of E. albidus from Greenland and Germany were similar after exposure to saline soils. Soil salinity up to 30‰ improved reproduction by a factor of ca. 10."},{"title":"Development of the navigational system in homing pigeons: increase in complexity of the navigational map","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2675","abstract":"In the present study we analysed GPS-recorded tracks from pigeons of different ages from 11 sites between 3.6 and 22.1 km from the home loft, which revealed changes in the navigational system as the birds grew older and became more experienced. The efficiency of juveniles in their first year of life, at only 0.27, was rather low, indicating that the young birds covered more than three times the direct distance home. In the second year, after a standard training programme, the efficiency of the same birds increased to 0.80 and was no longer different from that of older pigeons. The short-term correlation dimension, a variable that reflects the number of factors involved in the navigational process, also increased with age. In juveniles, it was markedly lower than in the other two groups, but even in yearlings it was still significantly lower than that of old pigeons, indicating that the navigational map of yearlings is still developing. Our results indicate that the map system, although functional in the first year of life, continues to become more complex – older pigeons seem to either consider more navigational factors than younger ones or at least weigh the same factors differently."},{"title":"The response of the scleractinian coral Turbinaria reniformis to thermal stress depends on the nitrogen status of the coral holobiont","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2665","abstract":"The physiological response of the scleractinian coral Turbinaria reniformis to ammonium enrichment (3 μmol l−1) was examined at 26°C as well as during a 7 day increase in temperature to 31°C (thermal stress). At 26°C, ammonium supplementation had little effect on the coral physiology. It induced a decrease in symbiont density, compensated by an increase in chlorophyll content per symbiont cell. Organic carbon release was reduced, likely because of a better utilization of the photosynthesized carbon (i.e. incorporation into proteins, kept in the coral tissue). The δ15N signatures of the ammonium-enriched symbionts and host tissue were also significantly decreased, by 4 and 2‰, respectively, compared with the non-enriched conditions, suggesting a significant uptake of inorganic nitrogen by the holobiont. Under thermal stress, coral colonies that were not nitrogen enriched experienced a drastic decrease in photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments (chlorophyll a, β-carotene, diadinoxanthin, diatoxanthin and peridinin), followed by a decrease in the rates of photosynthesis and calcification. Organic carbon release was not affected by this thermal stress. Conversely, nitrogen-enriched corals showed an increase in their pigment concentrations, and maintained rates of photosynthesis and calcification at ca. 60% and 100% of those measured under control conditions, respectively. However, these corals lost more organic carbon into the environment. Overall, these results indicate that inorganic nitrogen availability can be important to determining the resilience of some scleractinian coral species to thermal stress, and can have a function equivalent to that of heterotrophic feeding concerning the maintenance of coral metabolism under stress conditions."},{"title":"Flight performance of western sandpipers, Calidris mauri, remains uncompromised when mounting an acute phase immune response","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2752","abstract":"Migratory birds have been implicated in the spread of some zoonotic diseases, but how well infected individuals can fly remains poorly understood. We used western sandpipers, Calidris mauri, to experimentally test whether flight is affected when long-distance migrants are mounting an immune response and whether migrants maintain immune defences during a flight in a wind tunnel. We measured five indicators of innate immunity in ‘flown-healthy’ birds (flying in a wind tunnel without mounting an immune response), ‘flown-sick’ birds (flying while mounting an acute phase response, which is part of induced innate immunity), and a non-flying control group (‘not-flown’). Voluntary flight duration did not differ between flown-healthy and flown-sick birds, indicating that mounting an acute phase response to simulated infection did not hamper an individual's ability to fly for up to 3 h. However, in comparison to not-flown birds, bacterial killing ability of plasma was significantly reduced after flight in flown-sick birds. In flown-healthy birds, voluntary flight duration was positively correlated with bacterial killing ability and baseline haptoglobin concentration of the blood plasma measured 1–3 weeks before experimental flights, suggesting that high quality birds had strong immune systems and greater flight capacity. Our findings indicate that flight performance is not diminished by prior immune challenge, but that flight while mounting an acute phase response negatively affects other aspects of immune function. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the transmission of avian diseases, as they suggest that birds can still migrate while fighting an infection."},{"title":"Costs of colour change in fish: food intake and behavioural decisions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2760","abstract":"Many animals, particularly reptiles, amphibians, fish and cephalopods, have the ability to change their body colour, for functions including thermoregulation, signalling and predator avoidance. Many fish plastically darken their body colouration in response to dark visual backgrounds, and this functions to reduce predation risk. Here, we tested the hypotheses that colour change in fish (1) carries with it an energetic cost and (2) affects subsequent shoal and habitat choice decisions. We demonstrate that guppies (Poecilia reticulata) change colour in response to dark and light visual backgrounds, and that doing so carries an energetic cost in terms of food consumption. By increasing food intake, however, guppies are able to maintain growth rates and meet the energetic costs of changing colour. Following colour change, fish preferentially choose habitats and shoals that match their own body colouration, and maximise crypsis, thus avoiding the need for further colour change but also potentially paying an opportunity cost associated with restriction to particular habitats and social associates. Thus, colour change to match the background is complemented by behavioural strategies, which should act to maximise fitness in variable environments."},{"title":"The physiological response of the marine platyhelminth Macrostomum lignano to different environmental oxygen concentrations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2741","abstract":"The respiration rate of meiofauna is difficult to measure, and the response to variations in the environmental oxygen concentration has so far been mainly addressed through behavioral investigation.

At higher oxygen saturations (>12 kPa), the animals showed a clear oxyconforming behavior. However, below this value, the flatworms kept respiration rates constant at 0.064±0.001 nmol O2 l−1 h−1 individual−1 down to 3 kPa PO2, and this rate was increased by 30% in animals that were reoxygenated after enduring a period of 1.5 h in anoxia. Physiological changes related to tissue oxygenation were assessed using live imaging techniques with different fluorophores in animals maintained in normoxic (21 kPa), hyperoxic (40 kPa) or near-anoxic (~0 kPa) conditions and subjected to anoxia–reoxygenation. The pH-sensitive dyes Ageladine-A and BCECF both indicated that pHi under near-anoxia increases by about 0.07–0.10 units. Mitochondrial membrane potential, Δψm, was higher in anoxic and hyperoxic than in normoxic conditions (JC1 dye data). Staining with ROS-sensitive dyes – DHE for detection of superoxide anion (O2•−) formation and C-H DFFDA for other ROS species aside from O2•− (H2O2, HOO• and ONOO) – showed increased ROS formation following anoxia–reoxygenation treatment. Animals exposed to hyperoxic, normoxic and anoxic treatments displayed no significant differences in O2•− formation, whereas mitochondrial ROS formation as detected by C-H2DFFDA was higher after hyperoxic exposure and lowest under near-anoxia conditions compared with the normoxic control group. Macrostomum lignano seems to be a species that is tolerant of a wide range of oxygen concentrations (being able to maintain aerobic metabolism from extremely low PO2 up to hyperoxic conditions), which is an essential prerequisite for successfully dealing with the drastic environmental oxygen variations that occur within intertidal sediments."},{"title":"Cardiovascular design in fin whales: high-stiffness arteries protect against adverse pressure gradients at depth","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2548","abstract":"Fin whales have an incompliant aorta, which, we hypothesize, represents an adaptation to large, depth-induced variations in arterial transmural pressures. We hypothesize these variations arise from a limited ability of tissues to respond to rapid changes in ambient ocean pressures during a dive. We tested this hypothesis by measuring arterial mechanics experimentally and modelling arterial transmural pressures mathematically. The mechanical properties of mammalian arteries reflect the physiological loads they experience, so we examined a wide range of fin whale arteries. All arteries had abundant adventitial collagen that was usually recruited at very low stretches and inflation pressures (2–3 kPa), making arterial diameter largely independent of transmural pressure. Arteries withstood significant negative transmural pressures (−7 to −50 kPa) before collapsing. Collapse was resisted by recruitment of adventitial collagen at very low stretches. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis of depth-induced variation of arterial transmural pressure. Because transmural pressures depend on thoracic pressures, we modelled the thorax of a diving fin whale to assess the likelihood of significant variation in transmural pressures. The model predicted that deformation of the thorax body wall and diaphragm could not always equalize thoracic and ambient pressures because of asymmetrical conditions on dive descent and ascent. Redistribution of blood could partially compensate for asymmetrical conditions, but inertial and viscoelastic lag necessarily limits tissue response rates. Without pressure equilibrium, particularly when ambient pressures change rapidly, internal pressure gradients will develop and expose arteries to transient pressure fluctuations, but with minimal hemodynamic consequence due to their low compliance."},{"title":"Immune response to an endotoxin challenge involves multiple immune parameters and is consistent among the annual-cycle stages of a free-living temperate zone bird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2573","abstract":"Trade-offs between immune function and other physiological and behavioural processes are central in ecoimmunology, but one important problem is how to distinguish a reallocation of resources away from the immune system from a reallocation or redistribution within the immune system. While variation in baseline values of individual immune parameters is well established, studies in wild animals on multiple parameters during an immune response are lacking. It also remains to be tested whether and how immune responses correlate with baseline values that vary, for example, over the course of an annual cycle. We studied immunological responses to an endotoxin challenge in skylarks (Alauda arvensis), a partial migrant bird breeding in temperate zones. We compared birds injected with the endotoxin LPS with un-injected controls, characterizing immunological responses with leukocyte profiles, titres of lytic enzymes and natural antibodies, and concentrations of haptoglobin and heat shock proteins. We did this in five annual-cycle stages to test whether the response varied throughout the year. The endotoxin challenge affected six of 10 measured parameters. Lysis titres and proportions of heterophils increased; haptoglobin concentrations and proportions of lymphocytes, basophils and eosinophils decreased. The variable effects on different immune components demonstrate the complexity of an immune response. We found no evidence that the response differed between annual-cycle stages. The response was independent of baseline measures taken directly upon capture in the field, indicating that birds were facing no immunological ceiling when mounting an immune response. Values of five parameters collected under field conditions were significantly related to values taken under standardized laboratory conditions. We conclude that multiple parts of the immune system are modulated during an immunological response and that responses are not re-organized throughout the annual cycle."},{"title":"Identification and characterisation of a functional aquaporin water channel (Anomala cuprea DRIP) in a coleopteran insect","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2564","abstract":"Water transport across the plasma membrane depends on the presence of the water channel aquaporin (AQP), which mediates the bulk movement of water through osmotic and pressure gradients. In terrestrial insects, which are solid and/or plant feeders, the entrance and exit of water is primarily executed along the alimentary tract, where the hindgut, particularly the rectum, is the major site of water conservation. A cDNA encoding the homologue of the water-specific Drosophila AQP [Drosophila integral protein (DRIP)] was identified through the RT-PCR of RNA isolated from the rectum of the cupreous chafer larvae, Anomala cuprea, a humus and plant root feeder. This gene (Anocu AQP1) has a predicted molecular mass of 26.471 kDa, similar to the DRIP clade of insect AQPs characterised from caterpillars, flies and several liquid-feeding insects. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, Anocu AQP1 showed the hallmarks of aquaporin-mediated water transport but no glycerol or urea permeability, and the reversible inhibition of elevated water transport through 1 mmol l−1 HgCl2. This is the first experimental demonstration of the presence of a water-specific AQP, namely DRIP, in the Coleoptera. The genome of the model beetle Tribolium castaneum contains six putative AQP sequences, one of which (Trica-1a, XP_972862) showed the highest similarity to Anocu AQP1 (~60% amino acid identity). Anocu AQP1 is predominantly expressed in the rectum. Using a specific antibody raised against DRIP in the silkworm Bombyx mori (AQP-Bom1), Anocu AQP1 was localised to the apical plasma membrane of rectal epithelial cells, and lacking in the midgut and gastric caecal epithelia. Based on the BeetleBase prediction, there are three putative AQPs (Trica-3a, 3b, 3c: XP_970728, 970912, 970791) that are homologous to B. mori aquaglyceroporin [AQP-Bom2 (GLP)]. The immunocytochemical studies using the specific anti-peptide antibody against AQP-Bom2 revealed the presence of the GLP homologue at the apical plasma membrane of enterocytes in the midgut and gastric caeca. Thus, DRIP (Anocu AQP1) and the putative GLP share epithelial fluid-transporting roles along the alimentary tract in cupreous chafer larvae."},{"title":"The effects of hibernation on the contractile and biochemical properties of skeletal muscles in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2587","abstract":"Hibernation is a crucial strategy of winter survival used by many mammals. During hibernation, thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus, cycle through a series of torpor bouts, each lasting more than a week, during which the animals are largely immobile. Previous hibernation studies have demonstrated that such natural models of skeletal muscle disuse cause limited or no change in either skeletal muscle size or contractile performance. However, work loop analysis of skeletal muscle, which provides a realistic assessment of in vivo power output, has not previously been undertaken in mammals that undergo prolonged torpor during hibernation. In the present study, our aim was to assess the effects of 3 months of hibernation on contractile performance (using the work loop technique) and several biochemical properties that may affect performance. There was no significant difference in soleus muscle power output–cycle frequency curves between winter (torpid) and summer (active) animals. Total antioxidant capacity of gastrocnemius muscle was 156% higher in torpid than in summer animals, suggesting one potential mechanism for maintenance of acute muscle performance. Soleus muscle fatigue resistance was significantly lower in torpid than in summer animals. Gastrocnemius muscle glycogen content was unchanged. However, state 3 and state 4 mitochondrial respiration rates were significantly suppressed, by 59% and 44%, respectively, in mixed hindlimb skeletal muscle from torpid animals compared with summer controls. These findings in hindlimb skeletal muscles suggest that, although maximal contractile power output is maintained in torpor, there is both suppression of ATP production capacity and reduced fatigue resistance."},{"title":"Sleep deprivation attenuates endotoxin-induced cytokine gene expression independent of day length and circulating cortisol in male Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2581","abstract":"Sleep is restorative, whereas reduced sleep leads to negative health outcomes, such as increased susceptibility to disease. Sleep deprivation tends to attenuate inflammatory responses triggered by infection or exposure to endotoxin, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Previous studies have demonstrated that Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), photoperiodic rodents, attenuate LPS-induced fever, sickness behavior and upstream pro-inflammatory gene expression when adapted to short day lengths. Here, we tested whether manipulation of photoperiod alters the suppressive effects of sleep deprivation upon cytokine gene expression after LPS challenge. Male Siberian hamsters were adapted to long (16 h:8 h light:dark) or short (8 h:16 h light:dark) photoperiods for >10 weeks, and were deprived of sleep for 24 h using the multiple platform method or remained in their home cage. Hamsters received an intraperitoneal injection of LPS or saline (control) 18 h after starting the protocol, and were killed 6 h later. LPS increased liver and hypothalamic interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) gene expression compared with vehicle. Among LPS-challenged hamsters, sleep deprivation reduced IL-1 mRNA levels in liver and hypothalamus, but not TNF. IL-1 attenuation was independent of circulating baseline cortisol, which did not increase after sleep deprivation. Conversely, photoperiod altered baseline cortisol, but not pro-inflammatory gene expression in sleep-deprived hamsters. These results suggest that neither photoperiod nor glucocorticoids influence the suppressive effect of sleep deprivation upon LPS-induced inflammation."},{"title":"Environmental salinity modulates the effects of elevated CO2 levels on juvenile hard-shell clams, Mercenaria mercenaria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2607","abstract":"Ocean acidification due to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations results in a decrease in seawater pH and shifts in the carbonate chemistry that can negatively affect marine organisms. Marine bivalves such as the hard-shell clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, serve as ecosystem engineers in estuaries and coastal zones of the western Atlantic and, as for many marine calcifiers, are sensitive to the impacts of ocean acidification. In estuaries, the effects of ocean acidification can be exacerbated by low buffering capacity of brackish waters, acidic inputs from freshwaters and land, and/or the negative effects of salinity on the physiology of organisms. We determined the interactive effects of 21 weeks of exposure to different levels of CO2 (~395, 800 and 1500 μatm corresponding to pH of 8.2, 8.1 and 7.7, respectively) and salinity (32 versus 16) on biomineralization, shell properties and energy metabolism of juvenile hard-shell clams. Low salinity had profound effects on survival, energy metabolism and biomineralization of hard-shell clams and modulated their responses to elevated PCO2. Negative effects of low salinity in juvenile clams were mostly due to the strongly elevated basal energy demand, indicating energy deficiency, that led to reduced growth, elevated mortality and impaired shell maintenance (evidenced by the extensive damage to the periostracum). The effects of elevated PCO2 on physiology and biomineralization of hard-shell clams were more complex. Elevated PCO2 (~800–1500 μatm) had no significant effects on standard metabolic rates (indicative of the basal energy demand), but affected growth and shell mechanical properties in juvenile clams. Moderate hypercapnia (~800 μatm PCO2) increased shell and tissue growth and reduced mortality of juvenile clams in high salinity exposures; however, these effects were abolished under the low salinity conditions or at high PCO2 (~1500 μatm). Mechanical properties of the shell (measured as microhardness and fracture toughness of the shells) were negatively affected by elevated CO2 alone or in combination with low salinity, which may have important implications for protection against predators or environmental stressors. Our data indicate that environmental salinity can strongly modulate responses to ocean acidification in hard-shell clams and thus should be taken into account when predicting the effects of ocean acidification on estuarine bivalves."},{"title":"Hydrodynamic resistance and flow patterns in the gills of a tilapine fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2595","abstract":"The gills of teleost fishes are often discussed as an archetypal counter-current exchange system, capable of supporting the relatively high metabolic rates of some fishes despite the low oxygen solubility of water. Despite an appreciation for the physiology of exchange at the gills, many questions remain regarding the hydrodynamical basis of ventilation in teleost fishes. In this study, the hydrodynamic resistance and flow fields around the isolated gills of a tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, were measured as a function of the applied pressure head. At ventilatory pressures typical of a fish at rest, the hydrodynamic resistance of the gills was nearly constant, the flow was laminar, shunting of water around the gills was essentially absent, and the distribution of water flow was relatively uniform. However, at the higher pressures typical of an active or stressed fish, some of these qualities were lost. In particular, at elevated pressures there was a decrease in the hydrodynamic resistance of the gills and substantial shunting of water around the gills. These effects suggest mechanical limits to maximum aerobic performance during activity or under adverse environmental conditions."},{"title":"High-frequency electrical stimulation reveals a p38–mTOR signaling module correlated with force–time integral","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2619","abstract":"High-frequency electrical stimulation (HFES) leads to muscle hypertrophy, and attention has been drawn to the high forces involved. However, both mechanical and metabolic stresses occur simultaneously, and both stimuli influence signaling cascades related to protein synthesis. This study aimed to identify the immediate signaling correlates of contraction-induced force and metabolic stresses under the hypothesis that HFES induces growth-related signaling through mechanical stimulation. Force–time integral (FTI) signaling in mouse tibialis anterior muscle was examined by separately manipulating the time of contraction to emphasize the metabolic aspect or the force of contraction to emphasize the mechanical aspect. When FTI was manipulated by changing the total time of activation, phosphorylation of p54 JNK, ERK and p70S6kT421/S424 was independent of FTI, while phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and p38 correlated with FTI. When FTI was manipulated by changing the force of contraction, p54 JNK, ERK and p70S6kT421/S424 were again independent of FTI, while phosphorylation of p38 and FAK correlated with FTI. Factor analysis identified a p38–mTOR signaling module that correlated with FTI in both experiments. The consistent link among p38, mTOR and FTI suggests that they form a connected signaling module sensitive to the mechanical aspects of FTI, separate from markers of metabolic load."},{"title":"Immune function is related to adult carotenoid and bile pigment levels, but not to dietary carotenoid access during development, in female mallard ducks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2632","abstract":"Immune function can be modulated by multiple physiological factors, including nutrition and reproductive state. Because these factors can vary throughout an individual's lifetime as a result of environmental conditions (affecting nutrition) or life-history stage (e.g. entering the adult reproduction stage), we must carefully examine the degree to which developmental versus adult conditions shape performance of the immune system. We investigated how variation in dietary access to carotenoid pigments – a class of molecules with immunostimulatory properties that females deposit into egg yolks – during three different developmental time points affected adult immunological and reproductive traits in female mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). In males and females of other avian species, carotenoid access during development affects carotenoid assimilation ability, adult sexual ornamentation and immune function, while carotenoid access during adulthood can increase immune response and reproductive investment (e.g. egg-laying capacity, biliverdin deposition in eggshells). We failed to detect effects of developmental carotenoid supplementation on adult immune function [phytohemagglutinin-induced cutaneous immune response, antibody production in response to the novel antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), or oxidative burst, assessed by changes in circulating nitric oxide levels], carotenoid-pigmented beak coloration, ovarian development, circulating carotenoid levels or concentration of bile pigments in the gall bladder. However, we did uncover positive relationships between circulating carotenoid levels during adulthood and KLH-specific antibody production, and a negative relationship between biliverdin concentration in bile and KLH-specific antibody production. These results are consistent with the view that adult physiological parameters better predict current immune function than do developmental conditions, and highlight a possible, previously unstudied relationship between biliverdin and immune system performance."},{"title":"Effect of stress on female-specific ornamentation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2641","abstract":"Signal honesty is theorized to be maintained by condition-dependent trait expression. However, the mechanisms mediating the condition dependence of sexually selected traits are often unknown. New work suggests that elevated glucocorticoid levels during physiological stress may play a role in maintaining signal honesty. Here, we experimentally examine the effect of both chronic and acute stress on the expression of the condition-dependent ornamentation of female striped plateau lizards, Sceloporus virgatus. Females were stressed either chronically via corticosterone implants or relatively acutely via autotomy, were sham manipulated or were left unmanipulated. Both stressors resulted in elevations in corticosterone within physiologically relevant levels, though the implants resulted in significantly higher levels than did autotomy. Corticosterone-implanted females were less likely to produce a clutch of eggs, but those individuals that did reproduce had reproductive output similar to that of females from other treatment groups. Compared with females in other groups, the corticosterone-implanted females tended to develop smaller ornaments that had less UV and orange-to-red wavelength reflectance relative to medium wavelength reflectance. The sex steroid hormones testosterone and estradiol were correlated to corticosterone levels, but did not appear to underlie the effect on ornament expression; of the steroids measured, only corticosterone levels were negatively related to ornament size and coloration. Thus, the condition-dependent ornamentation of female lizards is sensitive to chronic elevations in stress hormones, supporting their importance in the maintenance of signal honesty."},{"title":"Survival and arm abscission are linked to regional heterothermy in an intertidal sea star","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2183","abstract":"Body temperature is a more pertinent variable to physiological stress than ambient air temperature. Modeling and empirical studies on the impacts of climate change on ectotherms usually assume that body temperature within organisms is uniform. However, many ectotherms show significant within-body temperature heterogeneity. The relationship between regional heterothermy and the response of ectotherms to sublethal and lethal conditions remains underexplored. We quantified within-body thermal heterogeneity in an intertidal sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) during aerial exposure at low tide to examine the lethal and sublethal effects of temperatures of different body regions. In manipulative experiments, we measured the temperature of the arms and central disc, as well as survival and arm abscission under extreme aerial conditions. Survival was related strongly to central disc temperature. Arms were generally warmer than the central disc in individuals that survived aerial heating, but we found the reverse in those that died. When the central disc reached sublethal temperatures of 31–35°C, arms reached temperatures of 33–39°C, inducing arm abscission. The absolute temperature of individual arms was a poor predictor of arm abscission, but the arms lost were consistently the hottest at the within-individual scale. Therefore, the vital region of this sea star may remain below the lethal threshold under extreme conditions, possibly through water movement from the arms to the central disc and/or evaporative cooling, but at the cost of increased risk of arm abscission. Initiation of arm abscission seems to reflect a whole-organism response while death occurs as a result of stress acting directly on central disc tissues."},{"title":"The impact behaviour of silk cocoons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/14/2648","abstract":"Silk cocoons, constructed by silkmoths (Lepidoptera), are protective structural composites.

This study investigates the protective properties of silk cocoons with different morphologies by evaluating their impact resistance and damage tolerance. Finite element analysis was used to analyse empirical observations of the quasi-static impact response of the silk cocoons, and to evaluate the separate benefits of the structures and materials through the deformation and damage mechanism. We use design principles from composite engineering in order to understand the structure–property–function relationship of silkworm cocoons. Understanding the highly evolved survival strategies of the organisms building natural cocoons will hopefully lead to inspiration that in turn could lead to improved composite design."},{"title":"A magnetic pulse does not affect homing pigeon navigation: a GPS tracking experiment","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2192","abstract":"The cues by which homing pigeons are able to return to a home loft after displacement to unfamiliar release sites remain debated. A number of experiments in which migratory birds have been treated with a magnetic pulse have produced a disruption in their orientation, which argues that a ferrimagnetic sense is used for navigation in birds. One previous experiment has also indicated an effect of magnetic pulses on homing pigeon navigation, although with inconsistent results. Previous studies have shown that some magnetic-related information is transmitted by the trigeminal nerve to the brain in some bird species, including the homing pigeon. The function of this information is still unclear. It has been suggested that this information is important for navigation. Previous studies with trigeminal nerve lesioned homing pigeons have clearly shown that the lack of trigeminally mediated information, even if magnetic, is not crucial for homing performance. However, this result does not completely exclude the possibility that other ferrimagnetic receptors in the homing pigeon play a role in navigation. Additionally, recent studies on homing pigeons suggested the existence of a ferrimagnetic sense in a novel location presumably located in the inner ear (lagena). In the present study, we tested whether any ferrimagnetic magnetoreceptors, irrespective of their location in the bird's head, are involved in pigeons' homing. To do this, we treated homing pigeons with a strong magnetic pulse before release, tracked birds with GPS loggers and analyzed whether this treatment affected homing performance. In the single previous magnetic pulse experiment on homing pigeons, only initial orientation at a release site was considered and the results were inconsistent. We observed no effect of the magnetic pulse at any of the sites used on initial orientation, homing performance, tortuosity or track efficiency, which does not support a role for the ferrimagnetic sense in homing pigeon navigation, at least not in this geographic area, where magnetic field variations are in the region of 200 nT intensity and 0.8 deg inclination."},{"title":"Modulation of joint moments and work in the goat hindlimb with locomotor speed and surface grade","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2201","abstract":"Goats and other quadrupeds must modulate the work output of their muscles to accommodate the changing mechanical demands associated with locomotion in their natural environments. This study examined which hindlimb joint moments goats use to generate and absorb mechanical energy on level and sloped surfaces over a range of locomotor speeds. Ground reaction forces and the three-dimensional locations of joint markers were recorded as goats walked, trotted and galloped over 0, +15 and −15 deg sloped surfaces. Net joint moments, powers and work were estimated at the goats' hip, knee, ankle and metatarsophalangeal joints throughout the stance phase via inverse dynamics calculations. Differences in locomotor speed on the level, inclined and declined surfaces were characterized and accounted for by fitting regression equations to the joint moment, power and work data plotted versus non-dimensionalized speed. During level locomotion, the net work generated by moments at each of the hindlimb joints was small (less than 0.1 J kg−1 body mass) and did not vary substantially with gait or locomotor speed. During uphill running, by contrast, mechanical energy was generated at the hip, knee and ankle, and the net work at each of these joints increased dramatically with speed (P<0.05). The greatest increases in positive joint work occurred at the hip and ankle. During downhill running, mechanical energy was decreased in two main ways: goats generated larger knee extension moments in the first half of stance, absorbing energy as the knee flexed, and goats generated smaller ankle extension moments in the second half of stance, delivering less energy. The goats' hip extension moment in mid-stance was also diminished, contributing to the decrease in energy. These analyses offer new insight into quadrupedal locomotion, clarifying how the moments generated by hindlimb muscles modulate mechanical energy at different locomotor speeds and grades, as needed to accommodate the demands of variable terrain."},{"title":"Loss of integration is associated with reduced resistance to oxidative stress","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2213","abstract":"One cellular mechanism thought to be particularly important as a constraint on lifespan and life-history strategies is oxidative stress. Susceptibility to oxidative stress is influenced by a number of antioxidant defences, whose effectiveness depends on the synergistic and competitive interactions among them (biochemical integration). It is generally assumed that exposure to oxidative stress is detrimental, but it is also possible that low level oxidative stress has a positive effect on integration, and therefore carries some benefits. Using three experimental groups of zebra finches (control, mild and high flight activity), we tested whether exercise-induced oxidative stress altered the integration of the pro-oxidant/antioxidant system by manipulating levels of flight activity, known to generate oxidative stress in birds. We show for the first time that a short-term high level of physical activity leads to a reduction in integration among components of the blood antioxidant defences, associated with a reduced resistance to oxidative stress. We found no evidence of improved integration in the antioxidant defences at low levels of oxidative stress exposure, suggesting that improved integration is not the route whereby any benefits of low level stress exposure occur. These findings point to a reduction in biochemical integration as a potential mechanism explaining a reduced resistance to oxidative stress induced by short-term stressors."},{"title":"Aggressive behavior in the antennectomized male cricket Gryllus bimaculatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2221","abstract":"Male crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) exhibit intensively defensive aggressive behavior towards attacking males most often culminating in fighting. After the fight, the loser no longer exhibits aggressiveness in a second, separate encounter with another male; rather, the defeated male exhibits avoidance behavior. Here, we investigated the role of sensory input from the antennae in male defensive aggressive behavior. When we removed antennae from males (antennectomized males), we found that they showed little aggressiveness towards each other whereas they continued to exhibit typical fighting behavior towards an intact male. In addition, in a second encounter, antennectomized losers showed significantly higher aggressiveness towards another male than did intact losers. We further found that antennectomized crickets do not utilize visual or palpal sensory input to elicit aggressive behavior. In contrast, intact males showed aspects of aggressive behavior to male cuticular substances before and after winning a fight, and if they lost a fight they showed avoidance behavior. It thus appears that antennal sensory information is crucial in the mediation of aggressive and avoidance behaviors. However, sensory inputs from the antennae are not necessary to elicit defensive aggressive behavior but are necessary to discriminate conspecific males and initiate attacks against them."},{"title":"Sperm-attractant peptide influences the spermatozoa swimming behavior in internal fertilization in Octopus vulgaris","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2229","abstract":"Marine invertebrates exhibit both chemokinesis and chemotaxis phenomena, induced in most cases by the release of water-borne peptides or pheromones.

Using two-chamber and time-lapse microscopy assays, we demonstrate that this bioactive peptide is able to increase sperm motility and induce chemotaxis by changing the octopus spermatozoa swimming behavior in a dose-dependent manner. We also provide evidence that chemotaxis in the octopus requires the presence of extracellular calcium and membrane protein phophorylation at tyrosine.

Heritability of reproductive performance in mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2308","abstract":"Limits to sustained energy intake (SusEI) are important because they constrain many aspects of animal performance. Individual variability in SusEI may be imposed by genetic factors that are inherited from parents to offspring. Here, we investigated heritability of reproductive performance in MF1 mice. Food intake, milk energy output (MEO) and litter mass were measured in mothers (F0) and daughters (F1) that were raising litters of 10 pups. Cross-fostering was designed so that half of each litter consisted of biological offspring and the rest came from one unrelated female (i.e. fostered pups). Food intake increased linearly during early lactation and reached a plateau during late lactation (day 9–13, called the asymptotic food intake, FIAS, equivalent to SusEI). Parent–offspring regression showed that FIAS, MEO and litter mass were all positively and significantly related between mothers and their biological daughters, but no significant relationships were found between the same traits for mothers and fostered daughters. FIAS at peak lactation was significantly correlated to adult food intake and body mass when the mice were 6 months old and not lactating. In conclusion, a large part of the variation in FIAS could be explained by genetic variation or maternal effects in pregnancy whereas non-genetic maternal effects in lactation were negligible. As a consequence, biological daughters of mothers with high reproductive performance (i.e. high milk production and hence higher litter mass at weaning) had a better reproductive performance themselves, independent of the mother that raised them during lactation."},{"title":"The effect of vasopressin 1b receptor (V1bR) blockade on HPA axis activity in rats exposed to acute heat stress","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2302","abstract":"Thermal stressors such as low and high ambient temperature elicit an abundance of neuroendocrine responses including activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and arginine vasopressin (AVP) release. The exposure to heat is a particularly interesting model for studying AVP action because this kind of stressor represents not only an unpleasant experience but also a threat to osmotic homeostasis. As AVP has long been recognized as a hormone involved in the modulation of HPA axis activity, the aim of this study was to elucidate the role of AVP in acutely heat-exposed rats using Nelivaptan, a selective vasopressin 1b receptor (V1bR) antagonist. Rats were exposed to high ambient temperature (38°C) for 60 min. The circulating hormones were determined by ELISA or chemiluminescence, and intrapituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and V1bR level were determined by western blot. The results obtained show that V1bR blockade negatively affected the increase in blood ACTH caused by heat exposure. This treatment alone, or in combination with Nelivaptan, decreased intrapituitary V1bR levels while circulating AVP concentration was increased under the same conditions. Furthermore, a strong correlation was observed between blood ACTH and corticosterone concentration. In conclusion, our results directly confirm the positive role of AVP in the regulation of ACTH secretion from the pituitary in animals exposed to heat. Moreover, the results suggest that AVP from the general circulation influences pituitary V1bR."},{"title":"Rhythmic profiles of cell cycle and circadian clock gene transcripts in mice: a possible association between two periodic systems","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2276","abstract":"The circadian system shapes the rhythms of most biological functions. The regulation of the cell cycle by a circadian clock was suggested to operate via stages S, G2 and G2/M. This study investigated a possible time link at stages G1 and G1/S as well. The daily expression profiles of cell cycle markers (Ccnd1, Ccne1 and Pcna) and circadian clock genes (Per2 and Clock) were monitored in liver and esophagus (low and high proliferation index, respectively) of BALB/c mice. Locomotor activity displayed a 24 h rhythm, establishing the circadian organization of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In the liver, the mRNA level of Per2 and Clock fitted the circadian rhythm with a 7.5 h shift. This temporal pattern suggests that the liver harbors a functional circadian clock. The rhythm of the analyzed cell cycle genes, however, was of low significance fitness and showed an opposite peak time between Pcna and Clock. These results indicate a weak regulatory role of the circadian clock. In the esophagus, the rhythms of Clock and Per2 mRNA had a similar peak time and non-circadian periods. These results suggest either that the esophagus does not harbor a functional circadian apparatus or that the phenotypes stem from differences in phase and amplitude of the rhythms of its various cell types. The similarity in the rhythm parameters of Clock, Ccne1 and Pcna transcripts questions the control of the circadian clock on the cell cycle along the G1 and G1/S stages. Yet the G1/S transition may play a role in modulating the local clock of proliferating tissues."},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake. XV. Effects of wheel running on the energy budget during lactation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2316","abstract":"The capacity of animals to dissipate heat may constrain sustained energy intake during lactation. We examined these constraints at peak lactation in MF1 mice that had ad libitum access to food, or that had to run a pre-set target on running wheels to obtain ad libitum access to food. The voluntary distance run decreased sharply during pregnancy and peak lactation. When lactating females were provided with 80% of their estimated food requirements, and had to run pre-set distances of 2, 4 or 6 km before given access to additional ad libitum food, most of them did not complete the running target during late lactation and the mice with the highest targets failed to reach their targets earlier in lactation. There were consequently significant group differences in asymptotic food intake (2 km, 16.97±0.40 g day−1; 4 km, 14.29±0.72 g day−1; and 6 km, 12.65±0.45 g day−1) and weaned litter masses (2 km, 71.11±2.39 g; 4 km, 54.63±4.28 g and 6 km, 47.18±2.46 g). When the females did run sufficiently to gain ad libitum food access, their intake did not differ between the different distance groups or from controls that were not required to run. Thus, despite being physically capable of running the distances, mice could not exercise sufficiently in lactation to gain regular ad libitum access to food, probably because of the risks of hyperthermia when combining heat production from exercise with thermogenesis from lactation."},{"title":"Role of oxygen consumption in hypoxia protection by translation factor depletion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2283","abstract":"The reduction of protein synthesis has been associated with resistance to hypoxic cell death. Which components of the translation machinery control hypoxic sensitivity and the precise mechanism has not been systematically investigated, although a reduction in oxygen consumption has been widely assumed to be the mechanism. Using genetic reagents in Caenorhabditis elegans, we examined the effect on organismal survival after hypoxia of knockdown of 10 factors functioning at the three principal steps in translation. Reduction-of-function of all 10 translation factors significantly increased hypoxic survival to varying degrees, not fully accounted for by the level of translational suppression. Measurement of oxygen consumption showed that strong hypoxia resistance was possible without a significant decrease in oxygen consumption. Hypoxic sensitivity had no correlation with lifespan or reactive oxygen species sensitivity, two phenotypes associated with reduced translation. Resistance to tunicamycin, which produces misfolded protein toxicity, was the only phenotype that significantly correlated with hypoxic sensitivity. Translation factor knockdown was also hypoxia protective for mouse primary neurons. These data show that translation factor knockdown is hypoxia protective in both C. elegans and mouse neurons and that oxygen consumption does not necessarily determine survival; rather, mitigation of misfolded protein toxicity is more strongly associated with hypoxic protection."},{"title":"Hypoxia-induced compression in the tracheal system of the tobacco hornworm caterpillar, Manduca sexta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2293","abstract":"Abdominal pumping in caterpillars has only been documented during molting. Using synchrotron X-ray imaging in conjunction with high-speed flow-through respirometry, we show that Manduca sexta caterpillars cyclically contract their bodies in response to hypoxia, resulting in significant compressions of the tracheal system. Compression of tracheae induced by abdominal pumping drives external gas exchange, as evidenced by the high correlation between CO2 emission peaks and body movements. During abdominal pumping, both the compression frequency and fractional change in diameter of tracheae increased with body mass. However, abdominal pumping and tracheal compression were only observed in larger, older caterpillars (>0.2 g body mass), suggesting that this hypoxic response increases during ontogeny. The diameters of major tracheae in the thorax increased isometrically with body mass. However, tracheae in the head did not scale with mass, suggesting that there is a large safety margin for oxygen delivery in the head in the youngest animals. Together, these results highlight the need for more studies of tracheal system scaling and suggest that patterns of tracheal investment vary regionally in the body."},{"title":"Gait transitions and modular organization of mammal locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2257","abstract":"Quadrupedal locomotion is the result of complex interactions between biomechanical and neural systems. During steady gaits, both systems are in stable states. When the animal changes its speed, transitions between gaits can occur in which the different coordination parameters are dissociated. Consequently, transitions are the periods where it is possible to detect and identify those parameters involved in the mechanical or neural control of locomotion. We studied interlimb coordination using a sequential method (antero-posterior sequence) to measure the footfall patterns of dogs when accelerating and decelerating from 1.5 m s−1 to more than 6 m s−1 and back. We obtained 383 transitions between all the symmetrical and asymmetrical gaits used by the dogs. Analysis of the interlimb coordination modifications and of each foot parameter showed that mechanics drive the stance phase whereas coordination is controlled during the swing phase. Furthermore, comparison of the transition patterns between all gaits reveals the modular organization of locomotion: a pectoral module coordinates the two forelimbs, a pelvic module coordinates the two hindlimbs and an axial module coordinates the two pairs of limbs and the trunk motion. The three modules cooperate to give rise to a template of stable interlimb coordination pattern, such as walk, trot or gallop."},{"title":"Looming detection by identified visual interneurons during larval development of the locust Locusta migratoria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2266","abstract":"Insect larvae clearly react to visual stimuli, but the ability of any visual neuron in a newly hatched insect to respond selectively to particular stimuli has not been directly tested. We characterised a pair of neurons in locust larvae that have been extensively studied in adults, where they are known to respond selectively to objects approaching on a collision course: the lobula giant motion detector (LGMD) and its postsynaptic partner, the descending contralateral motion detector (DCMD). Our physiological recordings of DCMD axon spikes reveal that at the time of hatching, the neurons already respond selectively to objects approaching the locust and they discriminate between stimulus approach speeds with differences in spike frequency. For a particular approaching stimulus, both the number and peak frequency of spikes increase with instar. In contrast, the number of spikes in responses to receding stimuli decreases with instar, so performance in discriminating approaching from receding stimuli improves as the locust goes through successive moults. In all instars, visual movement over one part of the visual field suppresses a response to movement over another part. Electron microscopy demonstrates that the anatomical substrate for the selective response to approaching stimuli is present in all larval instars: small neuronal processes carrying information from the eye make synapses both onto LGMD dendrites and with each other, providing pathways for lateral inhibition that shape selectivity for approaching objects."},{"title":"Very low force-generating ability and unusually high temperature dependency in hummingbird flight muscle fibers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2247","abstract":"Hummingbird flight muscle is estimated to have among the highest mass-specific power output among vertebrates, based on aerodynamic models. However, little is known about the fundamental contractile properties of their remarkable flight muscles. We hypothesized that hummingbird pectoralis fibers generate relatively low force when activated in a tradeoff for high shortening speeds associated with the characteristic high wingbeat frequencies that are required for sustained hovering. Our objective was to measure maximal force-generating ability (maximal force/cross-sectional area, Po/CSA) in single, skinned fibers from the pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles, which power the wing downstroke and upstroke, respectively, in hummingbirds (Calypte anna) and in another similarly sized species, zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), which also has a very high wingbeat frequency during flight but does not perform a sustained hover. Mean Po/CSA in hummingbird pectoralis fibers was very low – 1.6, 6.1 and 12.2 kN m−2, at 10, 15 and 20°C, respectively. Po/CSA in finch pectoralis fibers was also very low (for both species, ~5% of the reported Po/CSA of chicken pectoralis fast fibers at 15°C). Q10-force (force generated at 20°C/force generated at 10°C) was very high for hummingbird and finch pectoralis fibers (mean=15.3 and 11.5, respectively) compared with rat slow and fast fibers (1.8 and 1.9, respectively). Po/CSA in hummingbird leg fibers was much higher than in pectoralis fibers at each temperature, and the mean Q10-force was much lower. Thus, hummingbird and finch pectoralis fibers have an extremely low force-generating ability compared with other bird and mammalian limb fibers, and an extremely high temperature dependence of force generation. However, the extrapolated maximum force-generating ability of hummingbird pectoralis fibers in vivo (~48 kN m−2) is substantially higher than the estimated requirements for hovering flight of C. anna. The unusually low Po/CSA of hummingbird and zebra finch pectoralis fibers may reflect a constraint imposed by a need for extremely high contraction frequencies, especially during hummingbird hovering."},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake. XVIII. Energy intake and reproductive output during lactation in Swiss mice raising small litters","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2349","abstract":"Limits to sustained energy intake (SusEI) during lactation in Swiss mice have been suggested to reflect the secretory capacity of the mammary glands. However, an alternative explanation is that milk production and food intake are regulated to match the limited growth capacity of the offspring. In the present study, female Swiss mice were experimentally manipulated in two ways – litter sizes were adjusted to be between 1 and 9 pups and mice were exposed to either warm (21°C) or cold (5°C) conditions from day 10 of lactation. Energy intake, number of pups and litter mass, milk energy output (MEO), thermogenesis, mass of the mammary glands and brown adipose tissue cytochrome c oxidase activity of the mothers were measured. At 21 and 5°C, pup mass at weaning was almost independent of litter size. Positive correlations were observed between the number of pups, litter mass, asymptotic food intake and MEO. These data were consistent with the suggestion that in small litters, pup requirements may be the major factor limiting milk production. Pups raised at 5°C had significantly lower body masses than those raised at 21°C. This was despite the fact that milk production and energy intake at the same litter sizes were both substantially higher in females raising pups at 5°C. This suggests that pup growth capacity is lower in the cold, perhaps due to pups allocating ingested energy to fuel thermogenesis. Differences in observed levels of milk production under different conditions may then reflect a complex interplay between factors limiting maternal performance (peripheral limitation and heat dissipation: generally better when it is cooler) and factors influencing maximum pup growth (litter size and temperature: generally better when it is hotter), and may together result in an optimal temperature favouring reproduction."},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake. XVI. Body temperature and physical activity of female mice during pregnancy","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2328","abstract":"Lactation is the most energy-demanding phase of mammalian reproduction, and lactation performance may be affected by events during pregnancy. For example, food intake may be limited in late pregnancy by competition for space in the abdomen between the alimentary tract and fetuses. Hence, females may need to compensate their energy budgets during pregnancy by reducing activity and lowering body temperature. We explored the relationships between energy intake, body mass, body temperature and physical activity throughout pregnancy in the MF1 mouse. Food intake and body mass of 26 females were recorded daily throughout pregnancy. Body temperature and physical activity were monitored every minute for 23 h a day by implanted transmitters. Body temperature and physical activity declined as pregnancy advanced, while energy intake and body mass increased. Compared with a pre-mating baseline period, mice increased energy intake by 56% in late pregnancy. Although body temperature declined as pregnancy progressed, this served mostly to reverse an increase between baseline and early pregnancy. Reduced physical activity may compensate the energy budget of pregnant mice but body temperature changes do not. Over the last 3 days of pregnancy, food intake declined. Individual variation in energy intake in the last phase of pregnancy was positively related to litter size at birth. As there was no association between the increase in body mass and the decline in intake, we suggest the decline was not caused by competition for abdominal space. These data suggest overall reproductive performance is probably not constrained by events during pregnancy."},{"title":"Limits to sustained energy intake. XVII. Lactation performance in MF1 mice is not programmed by fetal number during pregnancy","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/12/2339","abstract":"Several studies have suggested that lactation performance may be programmed by the number of fetuses during pregnancy, whereas other studies indicate that processes during lactation are more important. As gestation litter size and litter size in lactation are usually strongly correlated, separating the roles of pregnancy and lactation in lactation performance is difficult. To break this link, we experimentally manipulated litter size of MF1 mice to five or 16 pups per litter by cross-fostering. Litter size and mass at birth were recorded on day 1 of lactation prior to litter size manipulation. Maternal body mass and food intake, litter size and litter mass were measured daily throughout. After weaning, the potential differential utilisation of body tissues of the mothers was investigated. Relationships between maternal mass and food intake, including asymptotic daily food intake at peak lactation, offspring traits and other maternal parameters suggested that the number of fetuses the females had carried during pregnancy had no effect on lactation performance. Litter mass increases depended only on maternal food intake, which was highly variable between individuals, but was independent of fetal litter size. The sizes of key organs and tissues like the liver and alimentary tract were not related to maximal food intake at peak lactation or to fetal litter size, but the masses of the pelage, mammary glands and retroperitoneal fat pad were. These data suggest that while growth of the mammary glands and associated structures may be initiated in gestation, and vary in relation to the number of placentas, the ultimate sizes and activities of the tissues depends primarily on factors during lactation."},{"title":"An in vitro study of urea, water, ion and CO2/HCO3− transport in the gastrointestinal tract of the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias): the influence of feeding","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2063","abstract":"In vitro gut sac preparations made from the cardiac stomach (stomach 1), pyloric stomach (stomach 2), intestine (spiral valve) and colon were used to examine the impact of feeding on transport processes in the gastrointestinal tract of the dogfish shark. Preparations were made from animals that were euthanized after 1–2 weeks of fasting, or at 24–48 h after voluntary feeding on a 3% ration of teleost fish (hake). Sacs were incubated under initially symmetrical conditions with dogfish saline on both surfaces. In comparison to an earlier in vivo study, the results confirmed that feeding caused increases in H+ secretion in both stomach sections, but an increase in Cl− secretion only in stomach 2. Na+ absorption, rather than Na+ secretion, occurred in both stomach sections after feeding. All sections of the tract absorbed water and the intestine strongly absorbed Na+ and Cl−, regardless of feeding condition. The results also confirmed that feeding increased water absorption in the intestine (but not in the colon), and had little influence on the handling of Ca2+ and Mg2+, which exhibited negligible absorption across the tract. However, K+ was secreted in the intestine in both fasted and fed preparations. Increased intestinal water absorption occurred despite net osmolyte secretion into the mucosal saline. The largest changes occurred in urea and CO2/HCO3− fluxes. In fasted preparations, urea was absorbed at a low rate in all sections except the intestine, where it was secreted. Instead of an increase in intestinal urea secretion predicted from in vivo data, feeding caused a marked switch to net urea absorption. This intestinal urea transport occurred at a rate comparable to urea reabsorption rates reported at gills and kidney, and was apparently active, establishing a large serosal-to-mucosal concentration gradient. Feeding also greatly increased intestinal CO2/HCO3− secretion; if interpreted as HCO3− transport, the rates were in the upper range of those reported in marine teleosts. Phloretin (0.25 mmol l−1, applied mucosally) completely blocked the increases in intestinal urea absorption and CO2/HCO3− secretion caused by feeding, but had no effect on Na+, Cl− or water absorption."},{"title":"Insect herbivores can choose microclimates to achieve nutritional homeostasis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2089","abstract":"The interaction between temperature and diet quality can affect the life history of ectotherms. The rate and ratio at which protein and carbohydrate are obtained from food are important aspects of diet quality, and insects have a well-developed capacity to adjust their feeding behaviour and post-ingestive physiology to regulate intake and allocation of these nutrients. If the supply of protein and carbohydrate varies with temperature (e.g. via effects on intake, digestion or metabolism), then herbivorous insects can use thermoregulatory behaviour to help achieve nutritional homeostasis. When fed the host grass Triticum aestivum, Locusta migratoria nymphs absorbed and allocated protein and carbohydrate to growth with the same efficiency at 38°C as at 32°C; however, at the higher temperature, they ingested more food. In contrast, when feeding on Themeda triandra, the nymphs absorbed carbohydrate with higher efficiency at 32°C, and protein at 38°C. Using synthetic diets, we induced either a protein or a carbohydrate deficiency in experimental insects and showed that locusts placed in a thermal gradient following a meal of T. triandra selected 32°C when deprived of carbohydrate, and 38°C when deprived of protein. This capacity to use thermoregulatory behaviour to redress an imposed nutritional imbalance improved with experience of feeding on T. triandra. As predicted, locusts fed T. aestivum always chose higher temperatures, irrespective of nutritional state. Our results have consequences for understanding host-plant choice by herbivores and interpreting the effects of changed environmental temperatures and microclimate on animal–plant interactions."},{"title":"A cute and highly contrast-sensitive superposition eye – the diurnal owlfly Libelloides macaronius","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2081","abstract":"The owlfly Libelloides macaronius (Insecta: Neuroptera) has large bipartite eyes of the superposition type. The spatial resolution and sensitivity of the photoreceptor array in the dorsofrontal eye part was studied with optical and electrophysiological methods. Using structured illumination microscopy, the interommatidial angle in the central part of the dorsofrontal eye was determined to be Δφ=1.1 deg. Eye shine measurements with an epi-illumination microscope yielded an effective superposition pupil size of about 300 facets. Intracellular recordings confirmed that all photoreceptors were UV-receptors (λmax=350 nm). The average photoreceptor acceptance angle was 1.8 deg, with a minimum of 1.4 deg. The receptor dynamic range was two log units, and the Hill coefficient of the intensity–response function was n=1.2. The signal-to-noise ratio of the receptor potential was remarkably high and constant across the whole dynamic range (root mean square r.m.s. noise=0.5% Vmax). Quantum bumps could not be observed at any light intensity, indicating low voltage gain. Presumably, the combination of large aperture superposition optics feeding an achromatic array of relatively insensitive receptors with a steep intensity–response function creates a low-noise, high spatial acuity instrument. The sensitivity shift to the UV range reduces the clutter created by clouds within the sky image. These properties of the visual system are optimal for detecting small insect prey as contrasting spots against both clear and cloudy skies."},{"title":"Flight metabolism in relation to speed in Chiroptera: testing the U-shape paradigm in the short-tailed fruit bat Carollia perspicillata","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2073","abstract":"Aerodynamic theory predicts that flight for fixed-wing aircraft requires more energy at low and high speeds compared with intermediate speeds, and this theory has often been extended to predict speed-dependent metabolic rates and optimal flight speeds for flying animals.

We examined the metabolic rate of seven Seba's short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia perspicillata) during unrestrained flight in a wind tunnel at air speeds from 1 to 7 m s−1. Following intra-peritoneal administration of 13C-labeled Na-bicarbonate, we measured the enrichment in 13C of exhaled breath before and after flight. We converted fractional turnover of 13C into metabolic rate and power, based on the assumption that bats oxidized glycogen during short flights. Power requirements of flight varied with air speed in a U-shaped manner in five out of seven individuals, whereas energy turnover was not related to air speed in two individuals. Power requirements of flight were close to values predicted by Pennycuick's aerodynamic model for minimum power speed, but differed for maximum range speed. The results of our experiment support the theoretical expectation of a U-shaped power curve for flight metabolism in a bat."},{"title":"Activation of the immune system incurs energetic costs but has no effect on the thermogenic performance of house sparrows during acute cold challenge","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2097","abstract":"Trade-offs between the immune system and other condition-dependent life-history traits (reproduction, predator avoidance and somatic growth) have been well documented in both birds and mammals.

All six tarsi have a surface area of 1.3 mm−2 in contact with the water, but they did not dimple its surface when standing. Jumping was propelled by depression of the trochantera of both hind and middle legs, which are 40% longer than the front legs and 170% longer than the body. As these four legs progressively propelled the insect to take-off, they each created dimples on the water surface that expanded in depth and area. No dimples were associated with the front legs, which were not moved in a consistent sequence. The wings opened while the legs were moving and then flapped at a frequency of 148 Hz. The body was accelerated in a mean time of 21 ms to a mean take-off velocity of 0.7 m s−1. The best jumps reached velocities of 1.6 m s−1, and required an energy output of 7 μJ and a power output of 0.6 mW, with the fly experiencing a force of 140 g. The required power output indicates that direct muscle contractions could propel the jump without the need for elaborate mechanisms for energy storage. Take-off trajectories were steep, with a mean of 87 deg to the horizontal. Take-off velocity fell if a propulsive tarsus penetrated the surface of the water. If more tarsi became submerged, take-off was not successful. A second strategy for take-off was powered only by the wings and was associated with slower (1 deg ms−1 compared with 10 deg ms−1 when jumping) and less extensive movements of the propulsive joints of the middle and hind legs. No dimples were then created on the surface of the water. When jumping was combined with wing flapping, the acceleration time to take-off was reduced by 84% and the take-off velocity was increased by 168%. Jumping can potentially therefore enhance survival when threatened by a potential predator."},{"title":"Environment, behavior and physiology: do birds use barometric pressure to predict storms?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/1982","abstract":"Severe storms can pose a grave challenge to the temperature and energy homeostasis of small endothermic vertebrates. Storms are accompanied by lower temperatures and wind, increasing metabolic expenditure, and can inhibit foraging, thereby limiting energy intake. To avoid these potential problems, most endotherms have mechanisms for offsetting the energetic risks posed by storms. One possibility is to use cues to predict oncoming storms and to alter physiology and behavior in ways that make survival more likely. Barometric pressure declines predictably before inclement weather, and several lines of evidence indicate that animals alter behavior based on changes in ambient pressure. Here we examined the effects of declining barometric pressure on physiology and behavior in the white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys. Using field data from a long-term study, we first evaluated the relationship between barometric pressure, storms and stress physiology in free-living white-crowned sparrows. We then manipulated barometric pressure experimentally in the laboratory and determined how it affects activity, food intake, metabolic rates and stress physiology. The field data showed declining barometric pressure in the 12–24 h preceding snowstorms, but we found no relationship between barometric pressure and stress physiology. The laboratory study showed that declining barometric pressure stimulated food intake, but had no effect on metabolic rate or stress physiology. These data suggest that white-crowned sparrows can sense and respond to declining barometric pressure, and we propose that such an ability may be common in wild vertebrates, especially small ones for whom individual storms can be life-threatening events."},{"title":"Physiological plasticity of cardiorespiratory function in a eurythermal marine teleost, the longjaw mudsucker, Gillichthys mirabilis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2111","abstract":"An insufficient supply of oxygen under thermal stress is thought to define thermal optima and tolerance limits in teleost fish.

Heart rates measured under an acute heat stress every week during 28 days of acclimation suggested that both maximum heart rates and temperature at onset of maximum heart rates changed over time with acclimation. Hemoglobin levels increased with acclimation temperature, from 35 g l−1 in 9°C-acclimated fish to 60–80 g l−1 in 19°C- and 26°C-acclimated fish. Oxygen consumption rates during recovery from acute heat stress showed post-stress elevation in 26°C-acclimated fish. These data, coupled with elevated resting metabolic rates and heart rates at warm temperatures, suggest a high energetic cost associated with warm acclimation in G. mirabilis. Furthermore, acclimatory capacity appears to be optimized at 19°C, a temperature shown by behavioral studies to be close to the species' preferred temperature."},{"title":"Mechanisms of high-frequency song generation in brachypterous crickets and the role of ghost frequencies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2001","abstract":"Sound production in crickets relies on stridulation, the well-understood rubbing together of a pair of specialised wings. As the file of one wing slides over the scraper of the other, a series of rhythmic impacts causes harmonic oscillations, usually resulting in the radiation of pure tones delivered at low frequencies (2–8 kHz). In the short-winged crickets of the Lebinthini tribe, acoustic communication relies on signals with remarkably high frequencies (>8 kHz) and rich harmonic content. Using several species of the subfamily Eneopterinae, we characterised the morphological and mechanical specialisations supporting the production of high frequencies, and demonstrated that higher harmonics are exploited as dominant frequencies. These specialisations affect the structure of the stridulatory file, the motor control of stridulation and the resonance of the sound radiator. We placed these specialisations in a phylogenetic framework and show that they serve to exploit high-frequency vibrational modes pre-existing in the phylogenetic ancestor. In Eneopterinae, the lower frequency components are harmonically related to the dominant peak, suggesting they are relicts of ancestral carrier frequencies. Yet, such ghost frequencies still occur in the wings' free resonances, highlighting the fundamental mechanical constraints of sound radiation. These results support the hypothesis that such high-frequency songs evolved stepwise, by a form of punctuated evolution that could be related to functional constraints, rather than by only the progressive increase of the ancestral fundamental frequency."},{"title":"Induced cold-tolerance mechanisms depend on duration of acclimation in the chill-sensitive Folsomia candida (Collembola)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/1991","abstract":"During cold periods ectotherms may improve low temperature tolerance via rapid cold hardening (RCH) over a period of hours and/or long-term cold acclimation (LTCA) during days, weeks or months. However, the effect of duration and the major underlying mechanisms of these processes are still not fully understood. In the present study, the molecular and biochemical responses to RCH (1–3 h) and LTCA (1–3 days) and the corresponding benefits to survival were investigated using the chill-sensitive collembolan Folsomia candida. We investigated osmolyte accumulation, membrane restructuring and transcription of candidate genes as well as survival benefits in response to RCH and LTCA. RCH induced significant upregulation of targeted genes encoding enzymes related to carbohydrate metabolic pathways and genes encoding small and constitutively expressed heat shock proteins (Hsps), indicating that the animals rely on protein protection from a subset of Hsps during RCH and probably also LTCA. The upregulation of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolic processes initiated during RCH was likely responsible for a transient accumulation of myoinositol during LTCA, which may support the protection of protein and membrane function and structure. Membrane restructuring, composed especially of a significantly increased ratio of unsaturated to saturated phospholipid fatty acids seems to be a mechanism supplementary to activation of Hsps and myoinositol accumulation in LTCA. Thus, the moderate increase in cold shock tolerance conferred by RCH seems to be dominated by effects of Hsps, whereas the substantially better cold tolerance achieved after LTCA is dominated by post-transcriptional processes increasing membrane fluidity and cryoprotectant concentration."},{"title":"Reversible brain inactivation induces discontinuous gas exchange in cockroaches","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2012","abstract":"Many insects at rest breathe discontinuously, alternating between brief bouts of gas exchange and extended periods of breath-holding. The association between discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs) and inactivity has long been recognised, leading to speculation that DGCs lie at one end of a continuum of gas exchange patterns, from continuous to discontinuous, linked to metabolic rate (MR). However, the neural hypothesis posits that it is the downregulation of brain activity and a change in the neural control of gas exchange, rather than low MR per se, which is responsible for the emergence of DGCs during inactivity. To test this, Nauphoeta cinerea cockroaches had their brains inactivated by applying a Peltier-chilled cold probe to the head. Once brain temperature fell to 8°C, cockroaches switched from a continuous to a discontinuous breathing pattern. Re-warming the brain abolished the DGC and re-established a continuous breathing pattern. Chilling the brain did not significantly reduce the cockroaches' MR and there was no association between the gas exchange pattern displayed by the insect and its MR. This demonstrates that DGCs can arise due to a decrease in brain activity and a change in the underlying regulation of gas exchange, and are not necessarily a simple consequence of low respiratory demand."},{"title":"Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements of the three-dimensional flow field of a descending autorotating mahogany seed (Swietenia macrophylla)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2017","abstract":"An experimental investigation of near field aerodynamics of wind dispersed rotary seeds has been performed using stereoscopic digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). The detailed three-dimensional flow structure of the leading-edge vortex (LEV) of autorotating mahogany seeds (Swietenia macrophylla) in a low-speed vertical wind tunnel is revealed for the first time. The results confirm that the presence of strong spanwise flow and strain produced by centrifugal forces through a spiral vortex are responsible for the attachment and stability of the LEV, with its core forming a cone pattern with a gradual increase in vortex size. The LEV appears at 25% of the wingspan, increases in size and strength outboard along the wing, and reaches its maximum stability and spanwise velocity at 75% of the wingspan. At a region between 90 and 100% of the wingspan, the strength and stability of the vortex core decreases and the LEV re-orientation/inflection with the tip vortex takes place. In this study, the instantaneous flow structure and the instantaneous velocity and vorticity fields measured in planes parallel to the free stream direction are presented as contour plots using an inertial and a non-inertial frame of reference. Results for the mean aerodynamic thrust coefficients as a function of the Reynolds number are presented to supplement the DPIV data."},{"title":"Activity-dependent gene expression in honey bee mushroom bodies in response to orientation flight","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2031","abstract":"The natural history of adult worker honey bees (Apis mellifera) provides an opportunity to study the molecular basis of learning in an ecological context. Foragers must learn to navigate between the hive and floral locations that may be up to miles away. Young pre-foragers prepare for this task by performing orientation flights near the hive, during which they begin to learn navigational cues such as the appearance of the hive, the position of landmarks, and the movement of the sun. Despite well-described spatial learning and navigation behavior, there is currently limited information on the neural basis of insect spatial learning. We found that Egr, an insect homolog of Egr-1, is rapidly and transiently upregulated in the mushroom bodies in response to orientation. This result is the first example of an Egr-1 homolog acting as a learning-related immediate-early gene in an insect and also demonstrates that honey bee orientation uses a molecular mechanism that is known to be involved in many other forms of learning. This transcriptional response occurred both in naïve bees and in foragers induced to re-orient. Further experiments suggest that visual environmental novelty, rather than exercise or memorization of specific visual cues, acts as the stimulus for Egr upregulation. Our results implicate the mushroom bodies in spatial learning and emphasize the deep conservation of Egr-related pathways in experience-dependent plasticity."},{"title":"Asymmetry in cricket song: female preference and proximate mechanism of discrimination","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2046","abstract":"Subtle random deviations from perfect symmetry in bilateral traits are suggested to signal reduced phenotypic and genetic quality of a sender, but little is known about the related receiver mechanisms for discriminating symmetrical from asymmetrical traits. Here, we investigated these mechanisms in behavioural and neurophysiological experiments in the Mediterranean field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. A downward frequency modulation at the end of each syllable in the calling song has been suggested to indicate morphological asymmetry in sound radiating structures between left and right forewings. Even under ideal laboratory conditions on a trackball system, female crickets only discriminated between songs of symmetrical and asymmetrical males in two-choice experiments at carrier frequencies of 4.4 kHz and a large modulation depth of 600 and 800 Hz. Under these conditions they preferred the pure-tone calling songs over the modulated (asymmetrical) alternative, whereas no preference was observed at carrier frequencies of 4.9 and 5.2 kHz. These preferences correlate well with the responses of a pair of identified auditory interneurons (AN1), known for their importance in female phonotaxis. The AN1 interneuron is tuned to an average frequency of 4.9 kHz, and the roll-off towards lower and higher frequencies determines the magnitude of responses to pure-tone and frequency-modulated calling songs. The difference in response magnitude between the two neurons appears to drive the decision of females towards the song alternatives. We discuss the relevance of song differences based on asymmetry in the morphology of song-producing structures under natural conditions."},{"title":"Maturation of polarization and luminance contrast sensitivities in cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2039","abstract":"Polarization sensitivity is a characteristic of the visual system of cephalopods. It has been well documented in adult cuttlefish, which use polarization sensitivity in a large range of tasks such as communication, orientation and predation. Because cuttlefish do not benefit from parental care, their visual system (including the ability to detect motion) must be efficient from hatching to enable them to detect prey or predators. We studied the maturation and functionality of polarization sensitivity in newly hatched cuttlefish. In a first experiment, we examined the response of juvenile cuttlefish from hatching to the age of 1 month towards a moving, vertically oriented grating (contrasting and polarized stripes) using an optomotor response apparatus. Cuttlefish showed differences in maturation of polarization versus luminance contrast motion detection. In a second experiment, we examined the involvement of polarization information in prey preference and detection in cuttlefish of the same age. Cuttlefish preferentially chose not to attack transparent prey whose polarization contrast had been removed with a depolarizing filter. Performances of prey detection based on luminance contrast improved with age. Polarization contrast can help cuttlefish detect transparent prey. Our results suggest that polarization is not a simple modulation of luminance information, but rather that it is processed as a distinct channel of visual information. Both luminance and polarization sensitivity are functional, though not fully matured, in newly hatched cuttlefish and seem to help in prey detection."},{"title":"Effects of experimentally elevated traffic noise on nestling white-crowned sparrow stress physiology, immune function and life history","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2055","abstract":"Roads have been associated with behavioral and physiological changes in wildlife. In birds, roads decrease reproductive success and biodiversity and increase physiological stress. Although the consequences of roads on individuals and communities have been well described, the mechanisms through which roads affect birds remain largely unexplored. Here, we examine one mechanism through which roads could affect birds: traffic noise. We exposed nestling mountain white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha) to experimentally elevated traffic noise for 5 days during the nestling period. Following exposure to traffic noise we measured nestling stress physiology, immune function, body size, condition and survival. Based on prior studies, we expected the traffic noise treatment to result in elevated stress hormones (glucocorticoids), and declines in immune function, body size, condition and survival. Surprisingly, nestlings exposed to traffic noise had lower glucocorticoid levels and improved condition relative to control nests. These results indicate that traffic noise does affect physiology and development in white-crowned sparrows, but not at all as predicted. Therefore, when evaluating the mechanisms through which roads affect avian populations, other factors (e.g. edge effects, pollution and mechanical vibration) may be more important than traffic noise in explaining elevated nestling stress responses in this species."},{"title":"An androgenic gland membrane-anchored gene associated with the crustacean insulin-like androgenic gland hormone","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2122","abstract":"Crustacean male sexual differentiation is governed by the androgenic gland (AG) and specifically by the secreted insulin-like AG hormone (IAG), thus far identified in several decapod species including the Australian red claw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus (termed Cq-IAG). While a few insulin-like AG genes have been identified in crustaceans, other AG-specific genes have not been documented until now. In the present study, we describe the recent identification of a non-IAG AG-specific transcript obtained from the C. quadricarinatus AG cDNA library. This transcript, termed C. quadricarinatus membrane-anchored AG-specific factor (Cq-MAG), was fully sequenced and found to encode a putative product of 189 amino acids including a signal anchoring peptide. Expression of a recombinant GFP fusion protein lacking the signal anchor encoding sequence dramatically affected recombinant protein localization pattern. While the expression of the deleterious fusion protein was observed throughout most of the cell, the native GFP::Cq-MAG fusion protein was observed mainly surrounding the periphery of the nucleus, demonstrating an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like localization pattern. Moreover, co-expression of the wild-type Cq-MAG (fused to GFP) and the Cq-IAG hormone revealed that these peptides indeed co-localize. This study is the first to report a protein specifically associated with the insulin-like AG hormone in addition to the finding of another AG-specific transcript in crustaceans. Previous knowledge suggests that insulin/insulin-like factor secretion involves tissue-specific transcripts and membrane-anchored proteins. In this regard, Cq-MAG's tissue specificity, anchoring properties and intracellular co-localization with Cq-IAG suggest that it may play a role in the processing and secretion of this insulin-like AG hormone."},{"title":"The depth of the honeybee's backup sun-compass systems","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2129","abstract":"Honeybees have at least three compass mechanisms: a magnetic compass; a celestial or sun compass, based on the daily rotation of the sun and sun-linked skylight patterns; and a backup celestial compass based on a memory of the sun's movements over time in relation to the landscape. The interactions of these compass systems have yet to be fully elucidated, but the celestial compass is primary in most contexts, the magnetic compass is a backup in certain contexts, and the bees' memory of the sun's course in relation to the landscape is a backup system for cloudy days. Here we ask whether bees have any further compass systems, for example a memory of the sun's movements over time in relation to the magnetic field. To test this, we challenged bees to locate the sun when their known celestial compass systems were unavailable, that is, under overcast skies in unfamiliar landscapes. We measured the bees' knowledge of the sun's location by observing their waggle dances, by which foragers indicate the directions toward food sources in relation to the sun's compass bearing. We found that bees have no celestial compass systems beyond those already known: under overcast skies in unfamiliar landscapes, bees attempt to use their landscape-based backup system to locate the sun, matching the landscapes or skylines at the test sites with those at their natal sites as best they can, even if the matches are poor and yield weak or inconsistent orientation."},{"title":"How muscle fiber lengths and velocities affect muscle force generation as humans walk and run at different speeds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2150","abstract":"The lengths and velocities of muscle fibers have a dramatic effect on muscle force generation. It is unknown, however, whether the lengths and velocities of lower limb muscle fibers substantially affect the ability of muscles to generate force during walking and running. We examined this issue by developing simulations of muscle–tendon dynamics to calculate the lengths and velocities of muscle fibers from electromyographic recordings of 11 lower limb muscles and kinematic measurements of the hip, knee and ankle made as five subjects walked at speeds of 1.0–1.75 m s−1 and ran at speeds of 2.0–5.0 m s−1. We analyzed the simulated fiber lengths, fiber velocities and forces to evaluate the influence of force–length and force–velocity properties on force generation at different walking and running speeds. The simulations revealed that force generation ability (i.e. the force generated per unit of activation) of eight of the 11 muscles was significantly affected by walking or running speed. Soleus force generation ability decreased with increasing walking speed, but the transition from walking to running increased the force generation ability by reducing fiber velocities. Our results demonstrate the influence of soleus muscle architecture on the walk-to-run transition and the effects of muscle–tendon compliance on the plantarflexors' ability to generate ankle moment and power. The study presents data that permit lower limb muscles to be studied in unprecedented detail by relating muscle fiber dynamics and force generation to the mechanical demands of walking and running."},{"title":"Is cold acclimation of benefit to hibernating rodents?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/11/2140","abstract":"The thermal challenge associated with cold acclimation (CA) and hibernation requires effective cardio-respiratory function over a large range of temperatures. We examined the impact of acute cooling in a cold-naïve hibernator to quantify the presumed improvement in cardio-respiratory dysfunction triggered by CA, and estimate the role of the autonomic nervous system in optimising cardiac and respiratory function. Golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were held at a 12 h:12 h light:dark photoperiod and room temperature (21°C euthermic control) or exposed to simulated onset of winter in an environmental chamber, by progression to 1 h:23 h light:dark and 4°C over 4 weeks. In vivo acute cooling (core temperature Tb=25°C) in euthermic controls led to a hypotension and bradycardia, but preserved cardiac output. CA induced a hypertension at normothermia (Tb=37°C) but on cooling led to decreases in diastolic pressure below euthermic controls and a decrease in cardiac output, despite an increase in left ventricular conductance. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability suggested a decline in vagal tone on cooling euthermic hamsters (Tb=25°C). Following CA, vagal tone was increased at Tb=37°C, but declined more quickly on cooling (Tb=25°C) to preserve vagal tone at levels similar to euthermic controls at Tb=37°C. For the isolated heart, CA led to concentric hypertrophy with decreased end-diastolic volume, but with no change in intrinsic heart rate at either 37 or 25°C. Mechanical impairment was noted at 37°C following CA, with peak developed pressure decreased by 50% and peak rate-pressure product decreased by 65%; this difference was preserved at 25°C. For euthermic hearts, coronary flow showed thermal sensitivity, decreasing by 65% on cooling (T=25°C). By contrast, CA hearts had low coronary flow compared with euthermic controls, but with a loss of thermal sensitivity. Together, these observations suggest that CA induced a functional impairment in the myocardium that limits performance of the cardiovascular system at euthermia, despite increased autonomic input to preserve cardiac function. On acute cooling this autonomic control was lost and cardiac performance declined further than for cold-naïve hamsters, suggesting that CA may compromise elements of cardiovascular function to facilitate preservation of those more critical for subsequent rewarming."},{"title":"Heat storage in Asian elephants during submaximal exercise: behavioral regulation of thermoregulatory constraints on activity in endothermic gigantotherms","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1774","abstract":"Gigantic size presents both opportunities and challenges in thermoregulation. Allometric scaling relationships suggest that gigantic animals have difficulty dissipating metabolic heat. Large body size permits the maintenance of fairly constant core body temperatures in ectothermic animals by means of gigantothermy. Conversely, gigantothermy combined with endothermic metabolic rate and activity likely results in heat production rates that exceed heat loss rates. In tropical environments, it has been suggested that a substantial rate of heat storage might result in a potentially lethal rise in core body temperature in both elephants and endothermic dinosaurs. However, the behavioral choice of nocturnal activity might reduce heat storage. We sought to test the hypothesis that there is a functionally significant relationship between heat storage and locomotion in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), and model the thermoregulatory constraints on activity in elephants and a similarly sized migratory dinosaur, Edmontosaurus. Pre- and post-exercise (N=37 trials) measurements of core body temperature and skin temperature, using thermography were made in two adult female Asian elephants at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans, LA, USA. Over ambient air temperatures ranging from 8 to 34.5°C, when elephants exercised in full sun, ~56 to 100% of active metabolic heat production was stored in core body tissues. We estimate that during nocturnal activity, in the absence of solar radiation, between 5 and 64% of metabolic heat production would be stored in core tissues. Potentially lethal rates of heat storage in active elephants and Edmontosaurus could be behaviorally regulated by nocturnal activity."},{"title":"Rapid postnatal development of myoglobin from large liver iron stores in hooded seals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1793","abstract":"Hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) rely on large stores of oxygen, either bound to hemoglobin or myoglobin (Mb), to support prolonged diving activity. Pups are born with fully developed hemoglobin stores, but their Mb levels are only 25–30% of adult levels. We measured changes in muscle [Mb] from birth to 1 year of age in two groups of captive hooded seal pups, one being maintained in a seawater pool and one on land during the first 2 months. All pups fasted during the first month, but were fed from then on. The [Mb] of the swimming muscle musculus longissimus dorsi (LD) doubled during the month of fasting in the pool group. These animals had significantly higher levels and a more rapid rise in LD [Mb] than those kept on land. The [Mb] of the shoulder muscle, m. supraspinatus, which is less active in both swimming and hauled-out animals, was consistently lower than in the LD and did not differ between groups. This suggests that a major part of the postnatal rise in LD [Mb] is triggered by (swimming) activity, and this coincides with the previously reported rapid early development of diving capacity in wild hooded seal pups. Liver iron concentration, as determined from another 25 hooded seals of various ages, was almost 10 times higher in young pups (1–34 days) than in yearling animals and adults, and liver iron content of pups dropped during the first month, implying that liver iron stores support the rapid initial rise in [Mb]."},{"title":"Exposure to multiple cholinergic pesticides impairs olfactory learning and memory in honeybees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1799","abstract":"Pesticides are important agricultural tools often used in combination to avoid resistance in target pest species, but there is growing concern that their widespread use contributes to the decline of pollinator populations. Pollinators perform sophisticated behaviours while foraging that require them to learn and remember floral traits associated with food, but we know relatively little about the way that combined exposure to multiple pesticides affects neural function and behaviour. The experiments reported here show that prolonged exposure to field-realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor coumaphos and their combination impairs olfactory learning and memory formation in the honeybee. Using a method for classical conditioning of proboscis extension, honeybees were trained in either a massed or spaced conditioning protocol to examine how these pesticides affected performance during learning and short- and long-term memory tasks. We found that bees exposed to imidacloprid, coumaphos, or a combination of these compounds, were less likely to express conditioned proboscis extension towards an odor associated with reward. Bees exposed to imidacloprid were less likely to form a long-term memory, whereas bees exposed to coumaphos were only less likely to respond during the short-term memory test after massed conditioning. Imidacloprid, coumaphos and a combination of the two compounds impaired the bees' ability to differentiate the conditioned odour from a novel odour during the memory test. Our results demonstrate that exposure to sublethal doses of combined cholinergic pesticides significantly impairs important behaviours involved in foraging, implying that pollinator population decline could be the result of a failure of neural function of bees exposed to pesticides in agricultural landscapes."},{"title":"Control of motor activity in crayfish by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone via motoneuron excitability and sensory-motor integration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1808","abstract":"We studied the effects of the molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) on leg sensory-motor networks of the red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. The hormone was injected in isolated crayfish and network activity was analyzed 3 days after injection using electrophysiology on an in vitro preparation of the leg locomotor network. This 20E treatment deeply reduced motor activity, by affecting both intrinsic motoneuron (MN) properties and sensory-motor integration. Indeed, we noticed a general decrease in motor nerve tonic activities, principally in depressor and promotor nerves. Moreover, intracellular recordings of depressor MNs confirmed a decrease of MN excitability due to a drop in input resistance. In parallel, sensory inputs originating from a proprioceptor, which codes joint movements controlled by these MNs, were also reduced. The shape of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) triggered in MNs by sensory activity of this proprioceptor showed a reduction of polysynaptic components, whereas inhibitory PSPs were suppressed, demonstrating that 20E acted also on interneurons relaying sensory to motor inputs. Consequently, 20E injection modified the whole sensory-motor loop, as demonstrated by the alteration of the resistance reflex amplitude. These locomotor network changes induced by 20E were consistent with the decrease of locomotion observed in a behavioral test. In summary, 20E controls locomotion during crayfish premolt by acting on both MN excitability and sensory-motor integration. Among these cooperative effects, the drop of input resistance of MNs seems to be mostly responsible for the reduction of motor activity."},{"title":"Ultraviolet sensitivity and colour vision in raptor foraging","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1819","abstract":"Raptors have excellent vision, yet it is unclear how they use colour information. It has been suggested that raptors use ultraviolet (UV) reflections from vole urine to find good hunting grounds. In contrast, UV plumage colours in songbirds such as blue tits are assumed to be ‘hidden’ communication signals, inconspicuous to raptors. This ambiguity results from a lack of knowledge about raptor ocular media transmittance, which sets the limit for UV sensitivity. We measured ocular media transmittance in common buzzards (Buteo buteo), sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus), red kites (Milvus milvus) and kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) so that, for the first time, raptor UV sensitivity can be fully described. With this information, and new measurements of vole urine reflectance, we show that (i) vole urine is unlikely to provide a reliable visual signal to hunting raptors and (ii) blue tit plumage colours are more contrasting to blue tits than to sparrowhawks because of UV reflectance. However, as the difference between blue tit and sparrowhawk vision is subtle, we suggest that behavioural data are needed to fully resolve this issue. UV cues are of little or no importance to raptors in both vole and songbird interactions and the role of colour vision in raptor foraging remains unclear."},{"title":"Coordination of distinct but interacting rhythmic motor programs by a modulatory projection neuron using different co-transmitters in different ganglia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1827","abstract":"While many neurons are known to contain multiple neurotransmitters, the specific roles played by each co-transmitter within a neuron are often poorly understood. Here, we investigated the roles of the co-transmitters of the pyloric suppressor (PS) neurons, which are located in the stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) of the lobster Homarus americanus. The PS neurons are known to contain histamine; using RT-PCR, we identified a second co-transmitter as the FMRFamide-like peptide crustacean myosuppressin (Crust-MS). The modulatory effects of Crust-MS application on the gastric mill and pyloric patterns, generated in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG), closely resembled those recorded following extracellular PS neuron stimulation. To determine whether histamine plays a role in mediating the effects of the PS neurons in the STG, we bath-applied histamine receptor antagonists to the ganglion. In the presence of the antagonists, the histamine response was blocked, but Crust-MS application and PS stimulation continued to modulate the gastric and pyloric patterns, suggesting that PS effects in the STG are mediated largely by Crust-MS. PS neuron stimulation also excited the oesophageal rhythm, produced in the commissural ganglia (CoGs) of the STNS. Application of histamine, but not Crust-MS, to the CoGs mimicked this effect. Histamine receptor antagonists blocked the ability of both histamine and PS stimulation to excite the oesophageal rhythm, providing strong evidence that the PS neurons use histamine in the CoGs to exert their effects. Overall, our data suggest that the PS neurons differentially utilize their co-transmitters in spatially distinct locations to coordinate the activity of three independent networks."},{"title":"Modelling biomechanical requirements of a rider for different horse-riding techniques at trot","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1850","abstract":"The simplest model possible for bouncing systems consists of a point mass bouncing passively on a mass-less spring without viscous losses. This type of spring–mass model has been used to describe the stance period of symmetric running gaits. In this study, we investigated the interaction between horse and rider at trot using three models of force-driven spring (–damper)–mass systems. The first system consisted of a spring and a mass representing the horse that interact with another spring and mass representing the rider. In the second spring–damper–mass model, dampers, a free-fall and a forcing function for the rider were incorporated. In the third spring–damper–mass model, an active spring system for the leg of the rider was introduced with a variable spring stiffness and resting length in addition to a saddle spring with fixed material properties. The output of the models was compared with experimental data of sitting and rising trot and with the modern riding technique used by jockeys in racing. The models show which combinations of rider mass, spring stiffness and damping coefficient will result in a particular riding technique or other behaviours. Minimization of the peak force of the rider and the work of the horse resulted in an ‘extreme’ modern jockey technique. The incorporation of an active spring system for the leg of the rider was needed to simulate rising trot. Thus, the models provide insight into the biomechanical requirements a rider has to comply with to respond effectively to the movements of a horse."},{"title":"Opsin1-2, Gqα and arrestin levels at Limulus rhabdoms are controlled by diurnal light and a circadian clock","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1837","abstract":"Dark and light adaptation in photoreceptors involve multiple processes including those that change protein concentrations at photosensitive membranes. Light- and dark-adaptive changes in protein levels at rhabdoms have been described in detail in white-eyed Drosophila maintained under artificial light. Here we tested whether protein levels at rhabdoms change significantly in the highly pigmented lateral eyes of wild-caught Limulus polyphemus maintained in natural diurnal illumination and whether these changes are under circadian control. We found that rhabdomeral levels of opsins (Ops1-2), the G protein activated by rhodopsin (Gqα) and arrestin change significantly from day to night and that nighttime levels of each protein at rhabdoms are significantly influenced by signals from the animal's central circadian clock. Clock input at night increases Ops1-2 and Gqα and decreases arrestin levels at rhabdoms. Clock input is also required for a rapid decrease in rhabdomeral Ops1-2 beginning at sunrise. We found further that dark adaptation during the day and the night are not equivalent. During daytime dark adaptation, when clock input is silent, the increase of Ops1-2 at rhabdoms is small and Gqα levels do not increase. However, increases in Ops1-2 and Gqα at rhabdoms are enhanced during daytime dark adaptation by treatments that elevate cAMP in photoreceptors, suggesting that the clock influences dark-adaptive increases in Ops1-2 and Gqα at Limulus rhabdoms by activating cAMP-dependent processes. The circadian regulation of Ops1-2 and Gqα levels at rhabdoms probably has a dual role: to increase retinal sensitivity at night and to protect photoreceptors from light damage during the day."},{"title":"Novel locomotor muscle design in extreme deep-diving whales","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1862","abstract":"Most marine mammals are hypothesized to routinely dive within their aerobic dive limit (ADL). Mammals that regularly perform deep, long-duration dives have locomotor muscles with elevated myoglobin concentrations that are composed of predominantly large, slow-twitch (Type I) fibers with low mitochondrial volume densities (Vmt). These features contribute to extending ADL by increasing oxygen stores and decreasing metabolic rate. Recent tagging studies, however, have challenged the view that two groups of extreme deep-diving cetaceans dive within their ADLs. Beaked whales (including Ziphius cavirostris and Mesoplodon densirostris) routinely perform the deepest and longest average dives of any air-breathing vertebrate, and short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) perform high-speed sprints at depth. We investigated the locomotor muscle morphology and estimated total body oxygen stores of several species within these two groups of cetaceans to determine whether they (1) shared muscle design features with other deep divers and (2) performed dives within their calculated ADLs. Muscle of both cetaceans displayed high myoglobin concentrations and large fibers, as predicted, but novel fiber profiles for diving mammals. Beaked whales possessed a sprinter's fiber-type profile, composed of ~80% fast-twitch (Type II) fibers with low Vmt. Approximately one-third of the muscle fibers of short-finned pilot whales were slow-twitch, oxidative, glycolytic fibers, a rare fiber type for any mammal. The muscle morphology of beaked whales likely decreases the energetic cost of diving, while that of short-finned pilot whales supports high activity events. Calculated ADLs indicate that, at low metabolic rates, both beaked and short-finned pilot whales carry sufficient onboard oxygen to aerobically support their dives."},{"title":"Neither male gonadal androgens nor female reproductive costs drive development of sexual size dimorphism in lizards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1872","abstract":"Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is an extensively studied phenomenon in animals, including reptiles, but the proximate mechanism of its development is poorly understood. The most pervasive candidates are: (1) androgen-mediated control of growth, i.e. a positive effect of gonadal androgens (testosterone) on male growth in male-larger species, and a negative effect in female-larger species; and (2) sex-specific differences in energy allocation to growth, e.g. sex with larger reproductive costs should result in smaller body size. We tested these hypotheses in adults of the male-larger lizard Paroedura picta by conducting castrations with and without testosterone implants in males and manipulating reproductive status in females. Castration or testosterone replacement had no significant effect on final body length in males. High investment to reproduction had no significant effect on final body length in intact females. Interestingly, ovariectomized females and females with testosterone implants grew to larger body size than intact females. We did not find support for either of the above hypotheses and suggest that previously reported effects of gonadal androgens on growth in male lizards could be a consequence of altered behaviour or social status in manipulated individuals. Exogenous testosterone in females led to decreased size of ovaries; its effect on body size may be caused by interference with normal ovarian function. We suggest that ovarian factors, perhaps estrogens, not reproductive costs, can modify growth in female lizards and may thus contribute to the development of SSD. This hypothesis is largely supported by published results on the effect of testosterone treatment or ovariectomy on body size in female squamates."},{"title":"Ablation of the ability to control the right-to-left cardiac shunt does not affect oxygen uptake, specific dynamic action or growth in the rattlesnake Crotalus durissus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1881","abstract":"The morphologically undivided ventricle of the heart in non-crocodilian reptiles permits the mixing of oxygen-rich blood returning from the lungs and oxygen-poor blood from the systemic circulation. A possible functional significance for this intra-cardiac shunt has been debated for almost a century. Unilateral left vagotomy rendered the single effective pulmonary artery of the South American rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus, unable to adjust the magnitude of blood flow to the lung. The higher constant perfusion of the lung circulation and the incapability of adjusting the right–left shunt in left-denervated snakes persisted over time, providing a unique model for investigation of the long-term consequences of cardiac shunting in a squamate. Oxygen uptake recorded at rest and during spontaneous and forced activity was not affected by removing control of the cardiac shunt. Furthermore, metabolic rate and energetic balance during the post-prandial metabolic increment, plus the food conversion efficiency and growth rate, were all similarly unaffected. These results show that control of cardiac shunting is not associated with a clear functional advantage in adjusting metabolic rate, effectiveness of digestion or growth rates."},{"title":"Discontinuous locomotion and prey sensing in the leech","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1890","abstract":"The medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana, is an aquatic predator that utilizes water waves to locate its prey. However, to reach their prey, the leeches must move within the same water that they are using to sense prey. This requires that they either move ballistically towards a pre-determined prey location or that they account for their self-movement and continually track prey. We found that leeches do not localize prey ballistically. Instead, they require continual sensory information to track their prey. Indeed, in the event that the prey moves, leeches will approach the prey's new location. While leeches need to continually sense water disturbances to update their percept of prey location, their own behavior is discontinuous – approaching prey involves switching between swimming, crawling and non-locomoting. Each of these behaviors may allow for different sensory capabilities and may require different sensory filters. Here, we examined the sensory capabilities of leeches during each of these behaviors. We found that while one could expect the non-locomoting phases to direct subsequent behaviors, crawling phases were more effective than non-locomotor phases for providing direction. During crawling bouts, leeches adjusted their heading so as to become more directed towards the stimulus. This was not observed during swimming. Furthermore, in the presence of prey-like stimuli, leeches crawled more often and for longer periods of time."},{"title":"Hemocyanin with phenoloxidase activity in the chitin matrix of the crayfish gastrolith","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1898","abstract":"Gastroliths are transient extracellular calcium deposits formed by the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus von Martens on both sides of the stomach wall during pre-molt. Gastroliths are made of a rigid chitinous organic matrix, constructed as sclerotized chitin–protein microfibrils within which calcium carbonate is deposited. Although gastroliths share many characteristics with the exoskeleton, they are simpler in structure and relatively homogeneous in composition, making them an excellent cuticle-like model for the study of cuticular proteins. In searching for molt-related proteins involved in gastrolith formation, two integrated approaches were employed, namely the isolation and mass spectrometric analysis of proteins from the gastrolith matrix, and 454-sequencing of mRNAs from both the gastrolith-forming and sub-cuticular epithelia. SDS-PAGE separation of gastrolith proteins revealed a set of bands at apparent molecular masses of 75–85 kDa; mass spectrometry data matched peptide sequences from the deduced amino acid sequences of seven hemocyanin transcripts. This assignment was then examined by immunoblot analysis using anti-hemocyanin antibodies, also used to determine the spatial distribution of the proteins in situ. Apart from contributing to oxygen transport, crustacean hemocyanins were previously suggested to be involved in several aspects of the molt cycle, including hardening of the new post-molt exoskeleton via phenoloxidation. The phenoloxidase activity of gastrolith hemocyanins was demonstrated. It was also noted that hemocyanin transcript expression during pre-molt was specific to the hepatopancreas. Our results thus reflect a set of functionally versatile proteins, expressed in a remote metabolic tissue and dispersed via the hemolymph to perform different roles in various organs and structures."},{"title":"Sex-specific retinal pigmentation results in sexually dimorphic long-wavelength-sensitive photoreceptors in the eastern pale clouded yellow butterfly, Colias erate","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1916","abstract":"The compound eyes of the eastern pale clouded yellow butterfly, Colias erate, contain three types of ommatidia (I, II and III), identifiable by the differing arrangements of pigment clusters around the rhabdoms. The pigment color is red in all ommatidial types except for type II ommatidia of females, where the pigment is orange. Intracellular recordings demonstrated that the spectral sensitivities of the proximal photoreceptors (R5–8) of all ommatidia in both sexes are strongly tuned by the perirhabdomal pigments. These pigments act as long-pass filters, shifting the peak sensitivities into the wavelength range above 600 nm. Due to the sex-specific pigments in type II ommatidia, the spectral sensitivities of the R5–8 photoreceptors of females peaked at 620 nm while those in males peaked at 660 nm. The measured spectral sensitivities could be well reproduced by an optical model assuming a long-wavelength-absorbing visual pigment with peak absorbance at 565 nm. Whereas the sexual dimorphism was unequivocally demonstrated for the ventral eye region, dimorphism in the dorsal region was not found. Presumably the ventral region is adapted for sexual behaviors such as courtship and oviposition."},{"title":"Fatigue of insect cuticle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1924","abstract":"Many parts of the insect exoskeleton experience repeated cyclic loading. Although the cuticle of insects and other arthropods is the second most common natural composite material in the world, so far nothing is known about its fatigue properties, despite the fact that fatigue undoubtedly limits the durability of body parts in vivo. For the first time, we here present experimental fatigue data of insect cuticle. Using force-controlled cyclic loading, we determined the number of cycles to failure for hind legs (tibiae) and hind wings of the locust Schistocerca gregaria, as a function of the applied cyclic stress. Our results show that, although both are made from cuticle, these two body parts behave very differently. Wing samples showed a large fatigue range, failing after 100,000 cycles when we applied 46% of the stress needed for instantaneous failure [the ultimate tensile strength (UTS)]. Legs, in contrast, were able to sustain a stress of 76% of the UTS for the same number of cycles to failure. This can be explained by the difference in the composition and structure of the material, two factors that, amongst others, also affect the well-known behaviour of engineering composites. Final failure of the tibiae occurred via one of two different failure modes – crack propagation in tension or buckling in compression – indicating that the tibia is ‘optimized’ by evolution to resist both failure modes equally. These results are further discussed in relation to the evolution and normal use of these two body parts."},{"title":"Comparative feeding kinematics of tropical hylid tadpoles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1928","abstract":"Anuran larvae, which are otherwise simple in shape, typically have complex keratinized mouthparts (i.e. labial teeth and jaw sheaths) that allow them to graze upon surfaces. The diversity in these structures among species presumably reflects specializations that allow for maximal feeding efficiency on different types of food. However, we lack a general understanding of how these oral structures function during feeding. We used high-speed digital imaging (500 Hz) to observe tadpoles of six species from the anuran family Hylidae grazing on a standardized food-covered substrate. Tadpoles of these species vary in the number of labial tooth rows, belong to two different feeding guilds (benthic and nektonic), and inhabit ponds and streams. We confirmed that the labial teeth in these species serve two functions: anchoring the mouth to the substrate and raking material off of the substrate. In general, tadpoles with a larger maximum gape or those with fewer labial tooth rows opened and closed their mouths slower than tadpoles with smaller gape or more tooth rows. Nektonic feeding tadpoles released each of their tooth rows proportionally earlier in the gape cycle compared with benthic feeding tadpoles. Lastly, we found some support for the idea that deformation of the jaw sheaths during a feeding cycle is predictable based on tadpole feeding guild. Collectively, our data show that anatomical (e.g. number of labial teeth) and ecological features (e.g. feeding guild) of tadpoles significantly influence how tadpoles open and close their mouths during feeding."},{"title":"Unique arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase-2 polymorphism in salmonids and profound variations in thermal stability and catalytic efficiency conferred by two residues","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1938","abstract":"Melatonin contributes to synchronizing major biological and behavioral functions with cyclic changes in the environment. Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) is responsible for a daily rhythm in melatonin secretion. Teleost possess two enzyme forms, AANAT1 and AANAT2, preferentially expressed in the retina and the pineal gland, respectively. The concomitant action of light and temperature shapes the daily and seasonal changes in melatonin secretion: the former controls duration while the latter modulates amplitude. Investigating the respective roles of light and temperature is particularly relevant in the context of global warming, which is likely to affect the way fish decode and anticipate seasonal changes, with dramatic consequences on their physiology and behavior. Here we investigated the impact of temperature on pineal melatonin secretion of a migratory species, the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), the northernmost living and cold-adapted salmonid. We show that temperature directly impacts melatonin production in cultured pineal glands. We also show that one organ expresses two AANAT2 transcripts displaying high similarity between them and with trout Oncorhynchus mykiss AANAT2, differing by only two amino acid sites. We compared the kinetics and 3D models of these enzymes as well as of a chimeric construct, particularly with regard to their response to temperature. Our study brings interesting and new information on the evolutionary diversity of AANAT enzymes in teleosts and the role played by specific residues in the catalytic properties of the enzymes."},{"title":"Mobilization of ectopic yolk in Gallus gallus domesticus: a novel reverse lipid transport process","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1949","abstract":"In many oviparous animals, bursting type atresia of ovarian follicles occurs during the reproductive cycle, resulting in the escape of yolk into the extracellular compartment. In birds, this ectopic yolk is rapidly cleared by an unknown process that involves the appearance of yolk-engorged macrophage-like cells. To study this unique type of lipid transport, we injected young male chickens intra-abdominally with egg yolk. Absorption of egg yolk from the body cavity markedly increased the triacylglyceride-rich fraction (TRL) of plasma lipoproteins and was coincident with increased levels of plasma triacylglycerides (TAGs) but not non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). Thus, the transport of yolk lipids from the abdominal cavity appears to occur in lipoproteins and be more similar to the transport of hepatic TAGs to the periphery via lipoproteins than to transport of adipose TAGs to the periphery via NEFAs released by the action of lipases. When macrophages were exposed to yolk in vitro, they quickly phagocytized yolk; however, it is unclear whether this level of phagocytosis contributes significantly to total yolk clearance. Instead, the chicken macrophage may function more as a facilitator of yolk clearance through the modification of yolk lipoproteins and the regulation of the local and systemic immune response to ectopic yolk. Yolk appears to be anti-inflammatory in nature. Yolk did not increase levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IFNγ either in vivo or in vitro; in fact, yolk dampened many inflammatory changes caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Conversely, LPS-induced inflammation retarded yolk clearance from the abdominal cavity and plasma TAG levels."},{"title":"Production of chimeras between the Chinese soft-shelled turtle and Peking duck through transfer of early blastoderm cells","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1786","abstract":"Chimeras are useful models for studies of developmental biology and cell differentiation. Intraspecies and interspecies germline chimeras have been produced in previous studies, but the feasibility of producing chimeras between animals of two different classes remains unclear. To address this issue, we attempted to produce chimeras between the Chinese soft-shelled turtle and the Peking duck by transferring stage X blastoderm cells to recipient embryos. We then examined the survival and development of the PKH26-labeled donor cells in the heterologous embryos. At early embryonic stages, both turtle and duck donor cells that were labeled with PKH26 were readily observed in the brain, neural tube, heart and gonads of the respective recipient embryos. Movement of turtle donor-derived cells was observed in the duck host embryos after 48 h of incubation. Although none of the hatchlings presented a chimeric phenotype, duck donor-derived cells were detected in a variety of organs in the hatchling turtles, particularly in the gonads. Moreover, in the hatched turtles, mRNA expression of tissue-specific duck genes MEF2a and MEF2c was detected in many tissues, including the muscle, heart, small and large intestines, stomach and kidney. Similarly, SPAG6 mRNA was detected in a subset of turtle tissues, including the gonad and the small and large intestines. These results suggest that duck donor-derived cells can survive and differentiate in recipient turtles; however, no turtle-derived cells were detected in the hatched ducks. Our findings indicate that chimeras can be produced between animals of two different classes."},{"title":"Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1546","abstract":"Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould Physarum polycephalum (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while P. polycephalum is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, P. polycephalum reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While P. polycephalum altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from P. polycephalum with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments."},{"title":"Olfactory memories are intensity specific in larval Drosophila","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1552","abstract":"Learning can rely on stimulus quality, stimulus intensity, or a combination of these. Regarding olfaction, the coding of odour quality is often proposed to be combinatorial along the olfactory pathway, and working hypotheses are available concerning short-term associative memory trace formation of odour quality. However, it is less clear how odour intensity is coded, and whether olfactory memory traces include information about the intensity of the learnt odour. Using odour–sugar associative conditioning in larval Drosophila, we first describe the dose–effect curves of learnability across odour intensities for four different odours (n-amyl acetate, 3-octanol, 1-octen-3-ol and benzaldehyde). We then chose odour intensities such that larvae were trained at an intermediate odour intensity, but were tested for retention with either that trained intermediate odour intensity, or with respectively higher or lower intensities. We observed a specificity of retention for the trained intensity for all four odours used. This adds to the appreciation of the richness in ‘content’ of olfactory short-term memory traces, even in a system as simple as larval Drosophila, and to define the demands on computational models of associative olfactory memory trace formation. We suggest two kinds of circuit architecture that have the potential to accommodate intensity learning, and discuss how they may be implemented in the insect brain."},{"title":"Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1537","abstract":"Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [14C]-l-glucose and 3H2O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water absorption, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water absorption, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water absorption as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys."},{"title":"Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1523","abstract":"Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth Manduca sexta to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime."},{"title":"Multiple ferritins are vital to successful blood feeding and reproduction of the hard tick Haemaphysalis longicornis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/10/1905","abstract":"Ticks are obligate hematophagous parasites and important vectors of diseases. The large amount of blood they consume contains great quantities of iron, an essential but also toxic element.

Here, we investigated the function a newly identified secreted ferritin from the hard tick Haemaphysalis longicornis (HlFER2), together with the previously identified intracellular ferritin (HlFER1). Recombinant ferritins, expressed in Escherichia coli, were used for anti-serum preparation and were also assayed for iron-binding activity. RT-PCR and western blot analyses of different organs and developmental stages of the tick during blood feeding were performed. The localization of ferritins in different organs was demonstrated through an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test. RNA interference (RNAi) was performed to evaluate the importance of ferritin in blood feeding and reproduction of ticks. The midgut was also examined after RNAi using light and transmission electron microscopy. RT-PCR showed differences in gene expression in some organs and developmental stages. Interestingly, only HlFER2 was detected in the ovary during oviposition and in the egg despite the low mRNA transcript. RNAi induced a reduction in post-blood meal body weight, high mortality and decreased fecundity. The expression of vitellogenin genes was affected by silencing of ferritin. Abnormalities in digestive cells, including disrupted microvilli, and alteration of digestive activity were also observed. Taken altogether, our results show that the iron storage and protective functions of ferritin are crucial to successful blood feeding and reproduction of H. longicornis."},{"title":"Rapid mitochondrial adjustments in response to short-term hypoxia and re-oxygenation in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1561","abstract":"As oxygen concentrations in marine coastal habitats can fluctuate rapidly and drastically, sessile marine organisms such as the oyster Crassostrea gigas can experience marked and rapid oxygen variations.

Mitochondrial respiratory rates (states 3 and 4 stimulated by glutamate) and phosphorylation efficiency [respiratory control ratio (RCR) and the relationship between ADP and oxygen consumption (ADP/O)] were measured. Cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity and cytochrome concentrations (a, b, c1 and c) were measured to investigate the rearrangements of respiratory chain subunits. The potential implication of an alternative oxidase (AOX) was investigated using an inhibitor of the respiratory chain (antimycin A) and through gene expression analysis in gills and digestive gland. Results indicate a downregulation of mitochondrial capacity, with 60% inhibition of respiratory rates after 12 h of hypoxia. RCR remained stable, while ADP/O increased after 12 h of hypoxia and 1 h of re-oxygenation, suggesting increased phosphorylation efficiency. CCO showed a fast and remarkable increase of its catalytic activity only after 3 h of hypoxia. AOX mRNA levels showed similar patterns in gills and digestive gland, and were upregulated after 12 and 24 h of hypoxia and during re-oxygenation. Results suggest a set of controls regulating mitochondrial functions in response to oxygen fluctuations, and demonstrate the fast and extreme plasticity of oyster mitochondria in response to oxygen variations."},{"title":"Invasion and adaptation of a warm-adapted species to montane localities: effect of acclimation potential","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1578","abstract":"Drosophila ananassae has successfully invaded the cold and dry montane localities of the Western Himalayas in recent years.

We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of D. ananassae in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000–2010). We document invasion of D. ananassae to montane localities and increase in frequency of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light) remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various environmental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist for long durations. Desiccation and cold stress tolerance was increased after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, heat tolerance of the light morph was increased after adult heat acclimation with no influence on heat tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation of D. ananassae to montane localities. Future experiments should be carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of low versus high temperature and humidity during seasonal changes is assisted by different acclimation abilities of the two morphs of D. ananassae."},{"title":"The role of light in mediating the effects of ocean acidification on coral calcification","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1570","abstract":"We tested the effect of light and PCO2 on the calcification and survival of Pocillopora damicornis recruits settled from larvae released in southern Taiwan.

After 5 days, calcification was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. Calcification was affected by the interaction of PCO2 with light, and at 493 μatm PCO2 the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 μatm PCO2, the effect of light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 μatm PCO2, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 μatm and 878 μatm PCO2 at intermediate light intensities (ca. 70 μmol photons m−2 s−1), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and PCO2, and was highest at 122 μmol photons m−2 s−1 in both PCO2 treatments, but was unrelated to calcification. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high PCO2 decreased calcification of P. damicornis recruits at intermediate light intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of PCO2 on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory effects of high PCO2 on calcification at intermediate light intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities."},{"title":"Hearing threshold shifts and recovery after noise exposure in beluga whales, Delphinapterus leucas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1587","abstract":"Temporary threshold shift (TTS) after loud noise exposure was investigated in a male and a female beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas).

The highest TTS with the longest recovery duration was produced by noises of lower frequencies (11.2 and 22.5 kHz) and appeared at a test frequency of +0.5 octave. At higher noise frequencies (45 and 90 kHz), the TTS decreased. The TTS effect gradually increased with prolonged exposures ranging from 1 to 30 min.

This change is divided into the exclusive utilization of yolk-sac reserves (endogenous feeding), the concurrent utilization of yolk reserves and exogenous feeds (mixed feeding) and the complete dependence on external feeds (exogenous feeding). The change in food source is accompanied by well-characterized morphological changes, including the development of adipose tissue as an energy storage site, and continuous muscle development to improve foraging. The aim of this study was to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to these ontogenetic changes between the nutritional phenotypes in rainbow trout alevins. We therefore analyzed the expression of marker genes of metabolic pathways and microRNAs (miRNAs) important in the differentiation and/or maintenance of metabolic tissues. In exogenously feeding alevins, the last enzyme involved in glucose production (g6pca and g6pcb) and lipolytic gene expression (cpt1a and cpt1b) decreased, while that of gk, involved in hepatic glucose use, was induced. This pattern is consistent with a progressive switch from the utilization of stored (gluconeogenic) amino acids and lipids in endogenously feeding alevins to a utilization of exogenous feeds via the glycolytic pathway. A shift towards the utilization of external feeds is further evidenced by the increased expression of omy-miRNA-143, a homologue of the mammalian marker of adipogenesis. The expression of its predicted target gene abhd5, a factor in triglyceride hydrolysis, decreased concurrently, suggesting a potential mechanism in the onset of lipid deposition. Muscle-specific omy-miRNA-1/133 and myod1 expression decreased in exogenously feeding alevins, a molecular signature consistent with muscle hypertrophy, which may be linked to nutritional cues or increased foraging."},{"title":"Adaptive evolution of fish hatching enzyme: one amino acid substitution results in differential salt dependency of the enzyme","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1609","abstract":"Embryos of medaka Oryzias latipes hatch in freshwater, while those of killifish Fundulus heteroclitus hatch in brackish water. Medaka and Fundulus possess two kinds of hatching enzymes, high choriolytic enzyme (HCE) and low choriolytic enzyme (LCE), which cooperatively digest their egg envelope at the time of hatching. Optimal salinity of medaka HCE was found in 0 mol l−1 NaCl, and activity decreased with increasing salt concentrations. One of the two Fundulus HCEs, FHCE1, showed the highest activity in 0 mol l−1 NaCl, and the other, FHCE2, showed the highest activity in 0.125 mol l−1 NaCl. The results suggest that the salt dependencies of HCEs are well adapted to each salinity at the time of hatching. Different from HCE, LCEs of both species maintained the activity sufficient for egg envelope digestion in various salinities. The difference in amino acid sequence between FHCE1 and FHCE2 was found at only a single site at position 36 (Gly/Arg), suggesting that this single substitution causes the different salt dependency between the two enzymes. Superimposition of FHCE1 and FHCE2 with the 3-D structure model of medaka HCE revealed that position 36 was located on the surface of HCE molecule, far from its active site cleft. The results suggest a hypothesis that position 36 influences salt-dependent activity of HCE, not with recognition of primary structure around the cleavage site, but with recognition of higher ordered structure of egg envelope protein."},{"title":"Molecular and functional characterization of hemocyanin of the giant African millipede, Archispirostreptus gigas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1616","abstract":"In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O2 that fuels aerobic metabolism diffuses to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O2 is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as well as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit composition and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest floor-dwelling giant African millipede Archispirostreptus gigas and its allosteric oxygen-binding properties under various physico-chemical conditions. Archispirostreptus gigas Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylation. Phylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. Archispirostreptus gigas Hc binds O2 with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O2 binding is, moreover, modulated by Ca2+ ions, which increase the O2 affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; deoxygenated) as well as the relaxed (R; oxygenated) states, and by (l)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O2 affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, L. Cooperativity in O2 binding at half O2 saturation (n50) is pH dependent and maximal at ~pH 7.4, and the number of interacting O2-binding sites (q) is markedly increased by binding Ca2+. The data are discussed in the light of the mutually supplementary roles of Hc and the tracheal system for tissue O2 supply."},{"title":"Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1630","abstract":"Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain ion and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust Locusta migratoria. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K+] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K+ (EK) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K+ homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (EK≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K+]."},{"title":"The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1624","abstract":"Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O2 or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins."},{"title":"The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1650","abstract":"The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water permeable, P. sinensis lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na+] and [Cl−] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water loss by reducing urine output, which led to a reduction (by 29–76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent reduction (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in P. sinensis. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in P. sinensis during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of P. sinensis. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free amino acids, it can be deduced that ammonia production through amino acid catabolism was suppressed with a proportional reduction in proteolysis in P. sinensis during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, P. sinensis adopted a reduction in ammonia production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure."},{"title":"Aging and its modulation in a long-lived worker caste of the honey bee","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1638","abstract":"Highly social animals provide alternative aging models in which vastly different lifespan patterns are flexible, and linked to social caste. Research in these species aims to reveal how environment, including social cues, can shape the transition between short-lived and extremely long-lived phenotypes with negligible senescence. Among honey bee workers, short to intermediate lifespans are typical for summer castes, while the winter caste can live up to 10 times longer. For summer castes, experimental interventions could predictably accelerate, slow or revert functional senescence. In contrast, little is known about the partic ular conditions under which periods of negligible senescence in winter castes can be disrupted or sustained. We asked how manipulation of social environment in colonies with long-lived winter bees might alter the pace of functional senescence, measured as learning performance, as well as of cellular senescence, measured as lipofuscin accumulation. We show that behavioral senescence becomes rapidly detectable when the winter state is disrupted, and changes in social task behaviors and social environment (brood) are induced. Likewise, we found that cellular senescence was induced by such social intervention. However, cellular senescence showed marked regional differences, suggesting that particular brain regions age slower than others. Finally, by preventing post-winter colonies from brood rearing, behavioral senescence became undetectable, even after transition to the usually short-lived phenotypes had occurred. We envision that social regulation of negligible functional senescence and highly dynamic accumulation of a universal symptom of cellular aging (lipofuscin) offers rewarding perspectives to target proximate mechanisms of slowed aging."},{"title":"The functional role of caudal and anal/dorsal fins during the C-start of a bluegill sunfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1658","abstract":"Fast starts are crucial in the survival of aquatic swimmers to capture prey or avoid predators. Currently, it is widely accepted that during C-starts: (1) the caudal fin generates a considerable hydrodynamic force; and (2) anal/dorsal fins are erected to significantly increase the hydrodynamic force. In this work, the above hypotheses on the role of fins during C-starts are studied using experimentally guided numerical simulations of four bluegill sunfish, whose fins are removed or erected. The amount of force created by the body and fins at each time instant was not constant and varied during the C-start. Nevertheless, in agreement with hypothesis (1), up to 70% of the instantaneous hydrodynamic force was generated by the tail during Stage 2 of the C-start, when the sunfish rapidly bends out of the C-shape. Additionally, the contribution in Stage 1, when the sunfish bends into a C-shape, is less than 20% at each instant. Most of the force in Stage 1 was produced by the body of the sunfish. In contrast to hypothesis (2), the effect of erection/removal of the fins was less than 5% of the instantaneous force in both Stages 1 and 2, except for a short period of time (2 ms) just before Stage 2. However, it is known that the anal/dorsal fins are actively controlled during the C-start from muscle activity measurements. Based on the results presented here, it is suggested that the active control of the anal/dorsal fins can be related to retaining the stability of the sunfish against roll and pitch movements during the C-start. Furthermore, the erection of the fins increases the moment of inertia to make the roll and pitch movements more difficult."},{"title":"Antifreeze proteins in the primary urine of larvae of the beetle Dendroides canadensis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1695","abstract":"To avoid freezing while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, Dendroides canadensis (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae produce a family of antifreeze proteins (DAFPs) that are transcribed in specific tissues and have specific compartmental fates. DAFPs and associated thermal hysteresis activity (THA) have been shown previously in hemolymph and midgut fluid, but the presence of DAFPs has not been explored in primary urine, a potentially important site that can contain endogenous ice-nucleating compounds that could induce freezing. A maximum mean THA of 2.65±0.33°C was observed in primary urine of winter-collected D. canadensis larvae. THA in primary urine increased significantly through autumn, peaked in the winter and decreased through spring to levels of 0.2–0.3°C in summer, in a pattern similar to that of hemolymph and midgut fluid. THA was also found in hindgut fluid and excreted rectal fluid, suggesting that these larvae not only concentrate AFPs in the hindgut, but also excrete AFPs from the rectal cavity. Based on dafp transcripts isolated from Malpighian tubule epithelia, cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, identifying the presence of transcripts encoding 24 DAFP isoforms. Six of these Malpighian tubule DAFPs were known previously, but 18 are new. We also provide functional evidence that DAFPs can inhibit ice nucleators present in insect primary urine. This is potentially critical because D. canadensis larvae die if frozen, and therefore ice formation in any body fluid, including the urine, would be lethal."},{"title":"High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1670","abstract":"Humans use three cone photoreceptor classes for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction."},{"title":"Development of the GABA-ergic signaling system and its role in larval swimming in sea urchin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1704","abstract":"The present study aimed to elucidate the development and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic regulation of larval swimming in the sea urchin Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus by cloning glutamate decarboxylase (Hp-gad), GABAA receptor (Hp-gabrA) and GABAA receptor-associated protein (Hp-gabarap), and by performing immunohistochemistry. The regulation of larval swimming was increasingly dependent on the GABAergic system, which was active from the 2 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) pluteus stage onwards. GABA-immunoreactive cells were detected as a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and eventually constituted the ciliary band and a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells during the pluteus stage. Hp-gad transcription was detected by RT-PCR during the period when Hp-Gad-positive cells were seen as a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells and on the apical side of the ciliary band from the 2 d.p.f. pluteus stage. Consistent with these observations, inhibition of GAD with 3-mercaptopropioninc acid inhibited GABA immunoreactivity and larval swimming dose dependently. Hp-gabrA amplimers were detected weakly in unfertilized eggs and 4 d.p.f. plutei but strongly from fertilized eggs to 2 d.p.f. plutei, and Hp-GabrA, together with GABA, was localized at the ciliary band in association with dopamine receptor D1 from the two-arm pluteus stage. Hp-gabarap transcription and protein expression were detected from the swimming blastula stage. Inhibition of the GABAA receptor by bicuculline inhibited larval swimming dose dependently. Inhibition of larval swimming by either 3-mercaptopropionic acid or bicuculline was more severe in older larvae (17 and 34 d.p.f. plutei) than in younger ones (1 d.p.f. prism larvae)."},{"title":"Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1683","abstract":"The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, Proasellus) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among Proasellus species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments."},{"title":"Intertidal sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus) alter body shape in response to wave action","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1717","abstract":"Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific Pisaster ochraceus, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of P. ochraceus to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions."},{"title":"An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1726","abstract":"The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and additional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour."},{"title":"Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1736","abstract":"Hibernating ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (Tb) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and Tb briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate concentrations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal."},{"title":"Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider Lyssomanes viridis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/9/1744","abstract":"In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider Lyssomanes viridis by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship versus threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence versus absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features."},{"title":"Negative gravitactic behavior of Caenorhabditis japonica dauer larvae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1470","abstract":"Gravity on Earth is a constant stimulus and many organisms are able to perceive and respond to it.

Caenorhabditis japonica DL demonstrating nictation, a typical host-finding behavior, had a negative gravitactic behavior, whereas non-nictating C. japonica and C. elegans DL did not. The negative gravitactic index of nictating DL collected from younger nematode cultures was higher than that from older cultures. After a 24 h incubation in M9 buffer, nictating DL did not alter their negative gravitactic behavior, but a longer incubation resulted in less pronounced negative gravitaxis. These results are indicative of negative gravitaxis in nictating C. japonica DL, which is maintained once initiated, seems to be affected by the age of DL and does not appear to be a simple passive mechanism."},{"title":"The relative contribution of calcium, zinc and oxidation-based cross-links to the stiffness of Arion subfuscus glue","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1475","abstract":"Metal ions are present in many different biological materials, and are capable of forming strong cross-links in aqueous environments. The relative contribution of different metal-based cross-links was measured in the defensive glue produced by the terrestrial slug Arion subfuscus. This glue contains calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, iron and copper. These metals are essential to the integrity of the glue and to gel stiffening. Removal of all metals caused at least a 15-fold decrease in the storage modulus of the glue. Selectively disrupting cross-links involving hard Lewis acids such as calcium reduced the stiffness of the glue, while disrupting cross-links involving borderline Lewis acids such as zinc did not. Calcium is the most common cation bound to the glue (40 mmol l−1), and its charge is balanced primarily by sulphate at 82–84 mmol l−1. Thus these ions probably play a primary role in bringing polymers together directly. Imine bonds formed as a result of protein oxidation also contribute substantially to the stiffness of the glue. Disrupting these bonds with hydroxylamine caused a 33% decrease in storage modulus of the glue, while stabilizing them by reduction with sodium borohydride increased the storage modulus by 40%. Thus a combination of metal-based bonds operates in this glue. Most likely, cross-links directly involving calcium play a primary role in bringing together and stabilizing the polymer network, followed by imine bond formation and possible iron coordination."},{"title":"The contribution of the lateral line to ‘hearing’ in fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1484","abstract":"In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle displacement, with particle displacement dominating close to the source (the nearfield). At the receptor level, both the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of sound sources, especially in the nearfield. A now common way to test ‘hearing’ in fish involves auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), with recordings made from electrodes implanted near the auditory brainstem. These AEP recordings are typically conducted in enclosed acoustic environments with the fish well within the nearfield, especially for lower frequencies. We tested the contribution of neuromast hair cells to AEP by first testing intact goldfish (Carassius auratus), then ablating their neuromasts with streptomycin sulphate — disabling superficial and canal neuromasts — and retesting the same goldfish. We performed a similar experiment where only the superficial neuromasts were physically ablated. At 100 and 200 Hz, there was a 10–15 dB increase in threshold after streptomycin treatment but no significant difference at higher frequencies. There was no difference in threshold in control fish or in fish that only had superficial neuromasts removed, indicating that the differential responses were driven by canal neuromasts. Taken together, these results indicate that AEP results at lower frequencies should be interpreted as multimodal responses, rather than as ‘hearing’. The results also suggest that in natural situations both the ear and lateral line likely play an integrative role in detecting and localising many types of ‘acoustic’ stimuli."},{"title":"The invisible cues that guide king penguin chicks home: use of magnetic and acoustic cues during orientation and short-range navigation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1491","abstract":"King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) live in large and densely populated colonies, where navigation can be challenging because of the presence of many conspecifics that could obstruct locally available cues.

The main objective of this study was to investigate the importance of non-visual cues, such as magnetic and acoustic cues, for chicks' orientation and short-range navigation. In a series of experiments, the chicks were individually displaced from the colony to an experimental arena where they were released under different conditions. In the magnetic experiments, a strong magnet was attached to the chicks' heads. Trials were conducted in daylight and at night to test the relative importance of visual and magnetic cues. Our results showed that when the geomagnetic field around the chicks was modified, their orientation in the arena and the overall ability to home was not affected. In a low sound experiment we limited the acoustic cues available to the chicks by putting ear pads over their ears, and in a loud sound experiment we provided additional acoustic cues by broadcasting colony sounds on the opposite side of the arena to the real colony. In the low sound experiment, the behavior of the chicks was not affected by the limited sound input. In the loud sound experiment, the chicks reacted strongly to the colony sound. These results suggest that king penguin chicks may use the sound of the colony while orienting towards their home."},{"title":"Bat flight with bad wings: is flight metabolism affected by damaged wings?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1516","abstract":"Infection of North American bats with the keratin-digesting fungus Geomyces destructans often results in holes and ruptures of wing membranes, yet it is unknown whether flight performance and metabolism of bats are altered by such injuries. I conducted flight experiments in a circular flight arena with Myotis albescens and M. nigricans individuals with an intact or ruptured trailing edge of one of the plagiopatagial membranes. In both species, individuals with damaged wings were lighter, had a higher aspect ratio (squared wing span divided by wing area) and an increased wing loading (weight divided by wing area) than conspecifics with intact wings. Bats with an asymmetric reduction of the wing area flew at similar speeds to conspecifics with intact wings but performed fewer flight manoeuvres. Individuals with damaged wings showed lower metabolic rates during flight than conspecifics with intact wings, even when controlling for body mass differences; the difference in mass-specific metabolic rate may be attributable to the lower number of flight manoeuvres (U-turns) by bats with damaged wings compared with conspecifics with intact wings. Possibly, bats compensated for an asymmetric reduction in wing area by lowering their body mass and avoiding flight manoeuvres. In conclusion, it may be that bats suffer from moderate wing damage not directly, by experiencing increased metabolic rate, but indirectly, by a reduced manoeuvrability and foraging success. This could impede a bat's ability to gain sufficient body mass before hibernation."},{"title":"Linkages between the life-history evolution of tropical and temperate birds and the resistance of cultured skin fibroblasts to oxidative and non-oxidative chemical injury","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1373","abstract":"A fundamental challenge facing physiological ecologists is to understand how variation in life history at the whole-organism level might be linked to cellular function. Thus, because tropical birds have higher annual survival and lower rates of metabolism, we hypothesized that cells from tropical species would have greater cellular resistance to chemical injury than cells from temperate species. We cultured dermal fibroblasts from 26 tropical and 26 temperate species of birds and examined cellular resistance to cadmium, H2O2, paraquat, thapsigargin, tunicamycium, methane methylsulfonate (MMS) and UV light. Using ANCOVA, we found that the values for the dose that killed 50% of cells (LD50) from tropical birds were significantly higher for H2O2 and MMS. When we tested for significance using a generalized least squares approach accounting for phylogenetic relationships among species to model LD50, we found that cells from tropical birds had greater tolerance for Cd, H2O2, paraquat, tunicamycin and MMS than cells from temperate birds. In contrast, tropical birds showed either lower or no difference in tolerance to thapsigargin and UV light in comparison with temperate birds. These findings are consistent with the idea that natural selection has uniquely fashioned cells of long-lived tropical bird species to be more resistant to forms of oxidative and non-oxidative stress than cells from shorter-lived temperate species."},{"title":"Defense through sensory inactivation: sea hare ink reduces sensory and motor responses of spiny lobsters to food odors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1364","abstract":"Antipredator defenses are ubiquitous and diverse. Ink secretion of sea hares (Aplysia) is an antipredator defense acting through the chemical senses of predators by different mechanisms. The most common mechanism is ink acting as an unpalatable repellent. Less common is ink secretion acting as a decoy (phagomimic) that misdirects predators' attacks. In this study, we tested another possible mechanism – sensory inactivation – in which ink inactivates the predator's reception of food odors associated with would-be prey. We tested this hypothesis using spiny lobsters, Panulirus argus, as model predators. Ink secretion is composed of two glandular products, one being opaline, a viscous substance containing concentrations of hundreds of millimolar of total free amino acids. Opaline sticks to antennules, mouthparts and other chemosensory appendages of lobsters, physically blocking access of food odors to the predator's chemosensors, or over-stimulating (short term) and adapting (long term) the chemosensors. We tested the sensory inactivation hypotheses by treating the antennules with opaline and mimics of its physical and/or chemical properties. We compared the effects of these treatments on responses to a food odor for chemoreceptor neurons in isolated antennules, as a measure of effect on chemosensory input, and for antennular motor responses of intact lobsters, as a measure of effect on chemically driven motor behavior. Our results indicate that opaline reduces the output of chemosensors by physically blocking reception of and response to food odors, and this has an impact on motor responses of lobsters. This is the first experimental demonstration of inactivation of peripheral sensors as an antipredatory defense."},{"title":"Response of a free-flying songbird to an experimental shift of the light polarization pattern around sunset","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1381","abstract":"The magnetic field, the sun, the stars and the polarization pattern of visible light during twilight are important cues for orientation in nocturnally migrating songbirds. As these cues change with time and location on Earth, the polarization pattern was put forward as a likely key reference system calibrating the other compass systems. Whether this applies generally to migratory birds is, however, controversially discussed. We used an experimental approach in free-flying birds to study the role of polarization for their departure direction in autumn. Experimental birds experienced a 90 deg shift of the band of maximum polarization during sunset, whereas control birds experienced the polarization pattern as under natural conditions. Full view of the sunset cues near the horizon was provided during the cue conflict exposure. Here we show that both the experimental and the control birds being released after nautical twilight departed consistently towards south-southeast. Radiotelemetry allowed tracking of the first 15 km of the birds' outward journey, thus the intrinsic migration direction as chosen by the birds was measured. We found no recalibration of the magnetic compass after pre-exposure to a cue conflict between the natural magnetic field and the artificially shifted polarization pattern at sunset. The lacking difference in the departure direction of both groups may suggest that birds did not recalibrate any of the compass systems during the experiment. As free-flying migrants can use all available orientation cues after release, it remains unknown whether our birds might have used the magnetic and/or star compass to determine their departure direction."},{"title":"Electric organ discharge diversity in the genus Gymnotus: anatomo-functional groups and electrogenic mechanisms","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1501","abstract":"Previous studies describe six factors accounting for interspecific diversity of electric organ discharge (EOD) waveforms in Gymnotus. At the cellular level, three factors determine the locally generated waveforms: (1) electrocyte geometry and channel repertoire; (2) the localization of synaptic contacts on electrocyte surfaces; and (3) electric activity of electromotor axons preceding the discharge of electrocytes. At the organismic level, three factors determine the integration of the EOD as a behavioral unit: (4) the distribution of different types of electrocytes and specialized passive tissue forming the electric organ (EO); (5) the neural mechanisms of electrocyte discharge coordination; and (6) post-effector mechanisms. Here, we reconfirm the importance of the first five of these factors based on comparative studies of a wider diversity of Gymnotus than previously investigated. Additionally, we report a hitherto unseen aspect of EOD diversity in Gymnotus. The central region of the EO (which has the largest weight on the conspecific-received field) usually exhibits a negative–positive–negative pattern where the delay between the early negative and positive peaks (determined by neural coordination mechanisms) matches the delay between the positive and late negative peaks (determined by electrocyte responsiveness). Because delays between peaks typically determine the peak power frequency, this matching implies a co-evolution of neural and myogenic coordination mechanisms in determining the spectral specificity of the intraspecific communication channel. Finally, we define four functional species groups based on EO/EOD structure. The first three exhibit a heterogeneous EO in which doubly innervated electrocytes are responsible for a main triphasic complex. Group I species exhibit a characteristic cephalic extension of the EO. Group II species exhibit an early positive component of putative neural origin, and strong EO auto-excitability. Group III species exhibit an early, slow, negative wave of abdominal origin, and variation in EO auto-excitability. Representatives of Group IV generate a unique waveform comprising a main positive peak followed by a small, load-dependent negative component."},{"title":"A long life in the fast lane: positive association between peak metabolic rate and lifespan in a butterfly","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1388","abstract":"High peak metabolic rates may provide a performance advantage, but it may also entail a physiological cost. A long-held assumption is that high mass-specific energy expenditure is associated with short lifespan. To examine the relationship between energy expenditure and lifespan we asked two questions. First, do individuals have a consistent rate of metabolism throughout their life? Second, is metabolic rate correlated with lifespan? We analysed the repeatability of measurements of resting (RMR) and peak flight metabolic rate (MRpeak) throughout the life of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). Measurements of MRpeak showed significant repeatability. Senescence occurred only shortly before death. RMR showed a U-shaped relationship with age and very low repeatability. Intraspecific association between metabolic rates and lifespan was tested under three conditions: in the laboratory, under field conditions and in a laboratory experiment with repeated flight treatments. There was a significant correlation between MRpeak and lifespan in all three experiments, but the correlation was positive, not negative. RMR was not correlated with lifespan. Both MRpeak and lifespan may reflect physiological condition and therefore be positively correlated. Individuals with a large resource pool may be able to invest in mechanisms that slow down ageing. Individuals with high metabolic capacity may also possess adaptations against ageing. Molecular polymorphism in the gene phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) was significantly associated with both MRpeak and lifespan, and may have coevolved with defence mechanisms against senescence. Generalisations such as ‘live fast, die young’ may be too simple to explain the complex processes affecting ageing and lifespan."},{"title":"The influence of photosynthesis on host intracellular pH in scleractinian corals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1398","abstract":"The regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) is a fundamental aspect of cell physiology that has received little attention in studies of reef-building corals and symbiotic cnidarians. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that dynamic changes in the pHi of coral host cells are controlled by the photosynthetic activity of the coral's dinoflagellate symbionts. Using live cell imaging and the pH-sensitive dye SNARF-1, we tracked pH in symbiont-containing and symbiont-free cells isolated from the reef coral Stylophora pistillata. We characterised the response of coral pHi in the presence of a photosynthetic inhibitor, the dynamics of coral pHi during light exposure and how pHi values vary on exposure to a range of irradiance levels lying within the coral's photosynthesis–irradiance response curve. Our results demonstrate that increases in coral pHi are dependent on photosynthetic activity of intracellular symbionts and that pHi recovers under darkness to values that match those of symbiont-free cells. Furthermore, we show that the timing of the pHi response is governed by irradiance level and that pHi increases to irradiance-specific steady-state values. Minimum steady-state pHi values of 7.05±0.05 were obtained under darkness and maximum values of 7.46±0.07 were obtained under saturating irradiance. As changes in pHi often affect organism homeostasis, there is a need for continued research into acid/base regulation in symbiotic corals. More generally, these results represent the first characterization of photosynthesis-driven pHi changes in animal cells."},{"title":"Back home at night or out until morning? Nycthemeral variations in homing of anosmic Cory's shearwaters in a diurnal colony","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1430","abstract":"Olfactory cues have been shown to be important to homing petrels at night, but apparently those procellariiform species that also come back to the colony during the day are not impaired by smell deprivation. However, the nycthemeral distribution of homing, i.e. whether displaced birds released at night return to their burrow by night or during daylight, has never been investigated. To explore this question, we studied the homing behaviour of Cory's shearwater (Calonectris borealis) in the only known population where these birds are active at the colony both during the day and at night. Here, we compared the nocturnal versus diurnal homing schedule of birds treated with zinc sulphate (to induce a reversible but complete anosmia) with that of controls. Our results show that anosmic shearwaters were unable to home in the dark and were constrained to wait for the daylight to find their burrow again. Our results confirm that olfaction is the basic sensory input for homing by night even in a petrel species that is diurnally active at the colony."},{"title":"Effects of ocean acidification on early life-history stages of the intertidal porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1405","abstract":"Intertidal zone organisms naturally experience daily fluctuations in pH, presently reaching values beyond what is predicted for open ocean surface waters from ocean acidification (OA) by the year 2100, and thus present an opportunity to study the pH sensitivity of organisms that are presumably adapted to an acidified environment. The intertidal zone porcelain crab, Petrolisthes cinctipes, was used to study physiological responses to low pH in embryonic, larval and newly recruited juvenile life-history stages. In these crabs, embryonic development occurs in the pH-variable intertidal zone (pH 6.9–9.5), larvae mature in the more stable pelagic environment (pH 7.9–8.2), and juvenile crabs settle back into the pH-variable intertidal zone. We examined survival, cardiac performance, energetics and morphology in embryonic, larval and juvenile crabs exposed to two pH conditions (pH 7.9 and 7.6). Embryos and larvae were split by brood between the pH treatments for 9 days to examine brood-specific responses to low pH. Hatching success did not differ between pH conditions, but ranged from 30% to 95% among broods. Larval survival was not affected by acidification, but juvenile survival was reduced by ~30% after longer (40 days) exposure to low pH. Embryonic and larval heart rates were 37% and 20% lower at low pH, and there was a brood-specific response in embryos. Embryos did not increase in volume under acidified conditions, compared with a 15% increase in ambient conditions. We conclude that sustained exposure to low pH could be detrimental to P. cinctipes embryos and larvae despite the fact that embryos are regularly exposed to naturally fluctuating hypercapnic water in the intertidal zone. Importantly, our results indicate that early life-history stage responses to OA may be brood specific through as yet undetermined mechanisms."},{"title":"Impact of ocean acidification on metabolism and energetics during early life stages of the intertidal porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1412","abstract":"Absorption of elevated atmospheric CO2 is causing surface ocean pH to decline, a process known as ocean acidification (OA). To date, few studies have assessed the physiological impacts of OA on early life-history stages of intertidal organisms, which transition from habitats with fluctuating pH (intertidal zone) to relatively stable (pelagic zone) pH environments. We used the intertidal crab Petrolisthes cinctipes to determine whether metabolic responses to year 2300 predictions for OA vary among early developmental stages and to examine whether the effects were more pronounced in larval stages developing in the open ocean. Oxygen consumption rate, total protein, dry mass, total lipids and C/N were determined in late-stage embryos, zoea I larvae and newly settled juveniles reared in ambient pH (7.93±0.06) or low pH (7.58±0.06). After short-term exposure to low pH, embryos displayed 11% and 6% lower metabolism and dry mass, respectively, which may have an associated bioenergetic cost of delayed development to hatching. However, metabolic responses appeared to vary among broods, suggesting significant parental effects among the offspring of six females, possibly a consequence of maternal state during egg deposition and genetic differences among broods. Larval and juvenile metabolism were not affected by acute exposure to elevated CO2. Larvae contained 7% less nitrogen and C/N was 6% higher in individuals reared at pH 7.58 for 6 days, representing a possible switch from lipid to protein metabolism under low pH; the metabolic switch appears to fully cover the energetic cost of responding to elevated CO2. Juvenile dry mass was unaffected after 33 days exposure to low pH seawater. Increased tolerance to low pH in zoea I larvae and juvenile stages may be a consequence of enhanced acid–base regulatory mechanisms, allowing greater compensation of extracellular pH changes and thus preventing decreases in metabolism after exposure to elevated PCO2. The observed variation in responses of P. cinctipes to decreased pH in the present study suggests the potential for this species to adapt to future declines in near-shore pH."},{"title":"Characterization of genome methylation patterns in the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1423","abstract":"DNA methylation is a widely conserved epigenetic modification. The analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation patterns in various organisms suggests that major features of animal methylomes are widely conserved. However, based on the variation of DNA methyltransferase genes in invertebrates, it has also been proposed that DNA methylation could provide a molecular mechanism for ecological adaptation. We have now analyzed the methylome of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, which represents an organism with a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. Using genome-scale bisulfite sequencing, we show here that the S. gregaria methylome is characterized by CpG- and exon-specific methylation and thus shares two major features with other animal methylomes. In contrast to other invertebrates, however, overall methylation levels were substantially higher and a significant fraction of transposons was methylated. Additionally, genic sequences were densely methylated in a pronounced bimodal pattern, suggesting a role for DNA methylation in the regulation of locust gene expression. Our results thus uncover a unique pattern of genome methylation in locusts and provide an important foundation for investigating the role of DNA methylation in locust phase polyphenism."},{"title":"Pairs of pigeons act as behavioural units during route learning and co-navigational leadership conflicts","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1434","abstract":"In many species, group members obtain benefits from moving collectively, such as enhanced foraging efficiency or increased predator detection. In situations where the group's decision involves integrating individual preferences, group cohesion can lead to more accurate outcomes than solitary decisions. In homing pigeons, a classic model in avian orientation studies, individuals learn habitual routes home, but whether and how co-navigating birds acquire and share route-based information is unknown. Using miniature GPS loggers, we examined these questions by first training pairs (the smallest possible flocks) of pigeons together, and then releasing them with other pairs that had received separate pair-training. Our results show that, much like solitary individuals, pairs of birds are able to establish idiosyncratic routes that they recapitulate together faithfully. Also, when homing with other pairs they exhibit a transition from a compromise- to a leadership-like mechanism of conflict resolution as a function of the degree of disagreement (distance separating the two preferred routes) between the two pairs, although pairs tolerate a greater range of disagreements prior to the transition than do single birds. We conclude that through shared experiences during past decision-making, pairs of individuals can become units so closely coordinated that their behaviour resembles that of single birds. This has implications for the behaviour of larger groups, within which certain individuals have closer social affiliations or share a history of previous associations."},{"title":"Meal consumption is ineffective at maintaining or correcting water balance in a desert lizard, Heloderma suspectum","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1439","abstract":"Many xeric organisms maintain water balance by relying on dietary and metabolic water rather than free water, even when free water may be available. For such organisms, hydric state may influence foraging decisions, since meal consumption is meeting both energy and water demands. To understand foraging decisions it is vital to understand the role of dietary water in maintaining water balance. We investigated whether meal consumption was sufficient to maintain water balance in captive Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum) at varying levels of dehydration. Gila monsters could not maintain water balance over long time scales through meal consumption alone. Animals fed a single meal took no longer to dehydrate than controls when both groups were deprived of free water. Additionally, meal consumption imparts an acute short-term hydric cost regardless of hydration state. Meal consumption typically resulted in a significant elevation in osmolality at 6 h post-feeding, and plasma osmolality never fell below pre-feeding levels despite high water content (~70%) of meals. These results failed to support our hypothesis that dietary water is valuable to Gila monsters during seasonal drought. When considered in conjunction with previous research, these results demonstrate that Gila monsters, unlike many xeric species, are heavily reliant on seasonal rainfall and the resulting free-standing water to maintain water balance."},{"title":"Active downward propulsion by oyster larvae in turbulence","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1458","abstract":"Oyster larvae (Crassostrea virginica) could enhance their settlement success by moving toward the seafloor in the strong turbulence associated with coastal habitats. We characterized the behavior of individual oyster larvae in grid-generated turbulence by measuring larval velocities and flow velocities simultaneously using infrared particle image velocimetry. We estimated larval behavioral velocities and propulsive forces as functions of the kinetic energy dissipation rate ε, strain rate γ, vorticity ξ and acceleration α. In calm water most larvae had near-zero vertical velocities despite propelling themselves upward (swimming). In stronger turbulence all larvae used more propulsive force, but relative to the larval axis, larvae propelled themselves downward (diving) instead of upward more frequently and more forcefully. Vertical velocity magnitudes of both swimmers and divers increased with turbulence, but the swimming velocity leveled off as larvae were rotated away from their stable, velum-up orientation in strong turbulence. Diving speeds rose steadily with turbulence intensity to several times the terminal fall velocity in still water. Rapid dives may require a switch from ciliary swimming to another propulsive mode such as flapping the velum, which would become energetically efficient at the intermediate Reynolds numbers attained by larvae in strong turbulence. We expected larvae to respond to spatial or temporal velocity gradients, but although the diving frequency changed abruptly at a threshold acceleration, the variation in propulsive force and behavioral velocity was best explained by the dissipation rate. Downward propulsion could enhance oyster larval settlement by raising the probability of larval contact with oyster reef patches."},{"title":"Biodynamics of climbing: effects of substrate orientation on the locomotion of a highly arboreal lizard (Chamaeleo calyptratus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1448","abstract":"Arboreal substrates differ not only in diameter, but also in continuity and orientation. To gain more insight into the dynamics of small-branch locomotion in tetrapods we studied the veiled chameleon walking on inclined and declined perches of up to 60 deg slope. We found that forelimbs and hindlimbs contribute equally to the body's progression along inclines and declines. The higher-positioned limb's vertical impulses decreased with slope. And although vertical impulses in the lower-positioned limb increased with substrate slope, peak vertical forces decreased. The decrease in peak vertical forces in the lower-positioned limb can be explained by a considerable increase of tensile forces in the higher-positioned limb as the slope increases. In addition, limbs were more crouched on slopes whereas no changes in forward and backward reach were observed. Mediolateral impulses were the smallest amongst the force components, and lateral impulses (medially directed limb forces) exceeded medial impulses (laterally directed limb forces). On inclines and declines, limb placement was more variable than on level substrates. The tail never contacted the substrate during level locomotion; however, on inclines and declines, the tail was held closer to the substrate, with short substrate contacts in one-third of the analyzed trials. Regardless of substrate orientation the tail was always held straight above the branch; therefore, rotational moments induced by the tail were minimized."},{"title":"The metabolic cost of incline locomotion in the Svalbard rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea): the effects of incline grade and seasonal fluctuations in body mass","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/8/1355","abstract":"In a terrestrial environment animals must locomote over varying terrain; despite this, the majority of studies of animal locomotion focus on level locomotion. The influence moving up an inclined surface has on the metabolic cost of locomotion and the efficiency with which animals perform positive work against gravity is still not well understood. Generally speaking, existing data sets lack consistency in the use of grades, further compounded by differences between species in terms of morphology and locomotor gait. Here we investigated the metabolic cost of locomotion using respirometry in the Svalbard ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea). The Svalbard ptarmigan provides a unique opportunity to investigate the cost of incline locomotion as it undergoes a seasonal fluctuation in body mass, which doubles in winter, meaning the requirement for positive mechanical work also fluctuates with season. We demonstrate that at the same degree of incline, the cost of lifting 1 kg by 1 vertical metre remains relatively constant between seasons despite the large differences in body mass from summer to winter. These findings are consistent with the notion that positive mechanical work alone dictates the cost of lifting above a certain body mass. However, our data indicate that this cost may vary according to the degree of incline and gait."},{"title":"Flicker is part of a multi-cue response criterion in fiddler crab predator avoidance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1219","abstract":"Predator avoidance behaviour costs time, energy and opportunities, and prey animals need to balance these costs with the risk of predation. The decisions necessary to strike this balance are often based on information that is inherently imperfect and incomplete because of the limited sensory capabilities of prey animals. Our knowledge, however, about how prey animals solve the challenging task of restricting their responses to the most dangerous stimuli in their environment is very limited. Using dummy predators, we examined the contribution of visual flicker to the predator avoidance response of the fiddler crab Uca vomeris. The results illustrate that crabs let purely black or purely white dummies approach significantly closer than black-and-white flickering dummies. We show that this effect complements other factors that modulate escape timing such as retinal speed and the crab's distance to its burrow, and is therefore not due exclusively to an earlier detection of the flickering signal. By combining and adjusting a range of imperfect response criteria in a way that relates to actual threats in their natural environment, prey animals may be able to measure risk and adjust their responses more efficiently, even under difficult or noisy sensory conditions."},{"title":"Biomechanics of human bipedal gallop: asymmetry dictates leg function","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1338","abstract":"Unilateral skipping or bipedal galloping is one of the gait types that humans are able to perform. In contrast to many animals, where gallop is the preferred gait at higher speeds, human bipedal gallop only occurs spontaneously in very specific conditions (e.g. fast downhill locomotion). This study examines the lower limb mechanics and explores the possible reasons why humans do not spontaneously opt for gallop for steady-state locomotion on level ground. In 12 subjects, who were required to run and gallop overground at their preferred speed, kinematic and kinetic data were collected and mechanical work at the main lower limb joints (hip, knee, ankle) was calculated. In a separate treadmill experiment, metabolic costs were measured. Analysis revealed that the principal differences between running and galloping are located at the hip. The asymmetrical configuration of gallop involves distinct hip actions and foot placing, giving galloping legs different functions compared with running legs: the trailing leg decelerates the body in the vertical direction but propels it forward while the leading leg acts in the opposite way. Although both legs conserve mechanical energy by interchanging external mechanical energy with potential elastic energy, the specific orientation of the legs causes more energy dissipation and generation compared with running. This makes gallop metabolically more expensive and involves high muscular stress at the hips, which may be why humans do not use gallop for steady-state locomotion."},{"title":"Persistence, reticence and the management of multiple time memories by forager honey bees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1131","abstract":"Honey bee foragers form time memories that enable them to match their foraging activity to the time of day when a particular food source is most productive. Persistent foragers show food-anticipatory activity by making reconnaissance flights to the previously productive food source and may continue to inspect it for several days. In contrast, reticent foragers do not investigate the source but wait for confirmation from returning persistent foragers. To determine how persistent and reticent foragers might contribute to the colony's ability to rapidly reallocate foragers among sources, we trained foragers to collect sucrose from a feeder at a restricted time of day for several days and then observed their behavior for three consecutive days during which the feeder was empty. In two separate trials, video monitoring of the hive entrance during unrewarded test days in parallel with observing reconnaissance visits to the feeder revealed a high level of activity, in both persistent and reticent foragers, thought to be directed at other food sources. This ‘extracurricular’ activity showed a high degree of temporal overlap with reconnaissance visits to the feeder. In some cases, inspection flights to the unrewarded feeder were made within the same trip to an extracurricular source, indicating that honey bees have the ability to manage at least two different time memories despite coincidence with respect to time of day. The results have major implications for understanding flower fidelity throughout the day, flower constancy within individual foraging excursions, and the sophisticated cognitive management of spatiotemporal memories in honey bees."},{"title":"Differential regulation of sodium–potassium pump isoforms during smolt development and seawater exposure of Atlantic salmon","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1142","abstract":"Freshwater and seawater isoforms of the alpha subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) have previously been identified in gill ionocytes of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In the present study we examine the abundance and cellular localization of these isoforms during the parr–smolt transformation, a developmental process that is preparatory for seawater entry. The abundance of NKAα1a was lower in smolts than in parr, remained relatively constant during spring and decreased in summer. NKAα1b increased tenfold in smolts during spring, peaking in late April, coincident with downstream migration and increased salinity tolerance. NKAα1b increased a further twofold after seawater exposure of smolts, whereas NKAα1a decreased by 98%. The abundance of NKAα1b-positive, and NKAα1b and NKAα1a co-labeled ionocytes increased during smolt development, whereas the number of NKAα1a cells decreased. After seawater exposure of smolts, NKAα1b-positive ionocytes increased, NKAα1a-positive cells decreased, and co-labeled cells disappeared. Plasma growth hormone and cortisol increased during spring in smolts, but not in parr, peaking just prior to the highest levels of NKAα1b. The results indicate that the increase in the abundance of NKAα1b during smolt development is directly linked to the increase in salinity tolerance that occurs at this stage, but that significant changes also occur after seawater exposure. Spring increases in circulating levels of growth hormone and cortisol indicate that these hormones may be instrumental in upregulating NKAα1b during smolt development."},{"title":"Flow-dependent porosity and other biomechanical properties of mysticete baleen","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1152","abstract":"Despite its vital function in a highly dynamic environment, baleen is typically assumed to be a static material. Its biomechanical and material properties have not previously been explored. Thus I tested sections of baleen from bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus, and humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, alone or in groups representing miniature ‘racks’, in a flow tank through which water and buoyant particles circulated with variable flow velocity. Kinematic sequences were recorded through an endoscopic camera or viewing window. One set of experiments investigated particle capture; another series analyzed biomechanical behavior, including fringe spacing, movement and interaction. Baleen fringe porosity directly correlates, in a mostly linear fashion, with velocity of incident water flow. However, undulation and interaction of fringes (especially of bowheads) at higher flow velocities can decrease porosity. Fringe porosity depends on distance from the baleen plate. Porosity also varies, with fringe length, by position along the length of an individual plate. Plate orientation, which varied from 0 to 90 deg relative to water flow, is crucial in fringe spacing and particle capture. At all flow velocities, porosity is lowest with plates aligned parallel to water flow. Turbulence introduced when plates rotate perpendicular to flow (as in cross-flow filtration) increases fringe interaction, so that particles more easily strike fringes yet more readily dislodge. Baleen of bowhead whales, which feed by continuous ram filtration, differs biomechanically from that of humpbacks, which use intermittent lunge filtration. The longer, finer fringes of bowhead baleen readily form a mesh-like mat, especially at higher flow velocities, to trap tiny particles."},{"title":"Phenotypic plasticity in blood–oxygen transport in highland and lowland deer mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1167","abstract":"In vertebrates living at high altitude, arterial hypoxemia may be ameliorated by reversible changes in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (regulated by erythropoiesis) and/or changes in blood–oxygen affinity (regulated by allosteric effectors of hemoglobin function). These hematological traits often differ between taxa that are native to different elevational zones, but it is often unknown whether the observed physiological differences reflect fixed, genetically based differences or environmentally induced acclimatization responses (phenotypic plasticity). Here, we report measurements of hematological traits related to blood–O2 transport in populations of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) that are native to high- and low-altitude environments. We conducted a common-garden breeding experiment to assess whether altitude-related physiological differences were attributable to developmental plasticity and/or physiological plasticity during adulthood. Under conditions prevailing in their native habitats, high-altitude deer mice from the Rocky Mountains exhibited a number of pronounced hematological differences relative to low-altitude conspecifics from the Great Plains: higher hemoglobin concentrations, higher hematocrits, higher erythrocytic concentrations of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (an allosteric regulator of hemoglobin–oxygen affinity), lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations and smaller red blood cells. However, these differences disappeared after 6 weeks of acclimation to normoxia at low altitude. The measured traits were also indistinguishable between the F1 progeny of highland and lowland mice, indicating that there were no persistent differences in phenotype that could be attributed to developmental plasticity. These results indicate that the naturally occurring hematological differences between highland and lowland mice are environmentally induced and are largely attributable to physiological plasticity during adulthood."},{"title":"Contributions of phenotypic plasticity to differences in thermogenic performance between highland and lowland deer mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1160","abstract":"Small mammals face especially severe thermoregulatory challenges at high altitude because the reduced O2 availability constrains the capacity for aerobic thermogenesis. Adaptive enhancement of thermogenic performance under hypoxic conditions may be achieved via physiological adjustments that occur within the lifetime of individuals (phenotypic plasticity) and/or genetically based changes that occur across generations, but their relative contributions to performance differences between highland and lowland natives are unclear. Here, we examined potentially evolved differences in thermogenic performance between populations of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) that are native to different altitudes. The purpose of the study was to assess the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to population differences in thermogenic performance under hypoxia. We used a common-garden deacclimation experiment to demonstrate that highland deer mice have enhanced thermogenic capacities under hypoxia, and that performance differences between highland and lowland mice persist when individuals are born and reared under common-garden conditions, suggesting that differences in thermogenic capacity have a genetic basis. Conversely, population differences in thermogenic endurance appear to be entirely attributable to physiological plasticity during adulthood. These combined results reveal distinct sources of phenotypic plasticity for different aspects of thermogenic performance, and suggest that thermogenic capacity and endurance may have different mechanistic underpinnings."},{"title":"Variation in temperature tolerance among families of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is associated with hypoxia tolerance, ventricle size and myoglobin level","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1183","abstract":"In fishes, performance failure at high temperature is thought to be due to a limitation on oxygen delivery (the theory of oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance, OCLTT), which suggests that thermal tolerance and hypoxia tolerance might be functionally associated. Here we examined variation in temperature and hypoxia tolerance among 41 families of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which allowed us to evaluate the association between these two traits. Both temperature and hypoxia tolerance varied significantly among families and there was a significant positive correlation between critical maximum temperature (CTmax) and hypoxia tolerance, supporting the OCLTT concept. At the organ and cellular levels, we also discovered support for the OCLTT concept as relative ventricle mass (RVM) and cardiac myoglobin (Mb) levels both correlated positively with CTmax (R2=0.21, P<0.001 and R2=0.17, P=0.003, respectively). A large RVM has previously been shown to be associated with high cardiac output, which might facilitate tissue oxygen supply during elevated oxygen demand at high temperatures, while Mb facilitates the oxygen transfer from the blood to tissues, especially during hypoxia. The data presented here demonstrate for the first time that RVM and Mb are correlated with increased upper temperature tolerance in fish. High phenotypic variation between families and greater similarity among full- and half-siblings suggests that there is substantial standing genetic variation in thermal and hypoxia tolerance, which could respond to selection either in aquaculture or in response to anthropogenic stressors such as global climate change."},{"title":"Mortality from desiccation contributes to a genotype–temperature interaction for cold survival in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1174","abstract":"Survival at cold temperatures is a complex trait, primarily because of the fact that the physiological cause of injury may differ across degrees of cold exposure experienced within the lifetime of an ectothermic individual.

Genetic effects on cold survival were temperature dependent and resulted in a significant genotype–temperature interaction for survival across cold temperature exposures that differ by as little as 2°C. We investigated desiccation as a potential mechanism of injury across these temperature exposures. Flies were dehydrated following exposures near 6°C, whereas flies were not dehydrated following exposures near −4°C. Furthermore, decreasing humidity during cold exposure decreased survival, and increasing humidity during cold exposure increased survival at 6°C, but not at −4°C. These results support the conclusion that in D. melanogaster there are multiple physiological mechanisms of cold-induced mortality across relatively small differences in temperature, and that desiccation contributes to mortality for exposures near 6°C but not for subzero temperatures. Because D. melanogaster has recently expanded its range from tropical to temperate latitudes, the complex physiologies underlying cold tolerance are likely to be important traits in the recent evolutionary history of this fruit fly."},{"title":"Roles of crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone in ionic and metabolic homeostasis in the Christmas Island blue crab, Discoplax celeste","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1191","abstract":"There is a growing body of evidence implicating the involvement of crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH) in ionic homeostasis in decapod crustaceans. However, little is known regarding hormonally influenced osmoregulatory processes in terrestrial decapods. As many terrestrial decapods experience opposing seasonal demands upon ionoregulatory physiologies, we reasoned that these would make interesting models in which to study the effect of CHH upon these phenomena. In particular, those (tropical) species that also undergo seasonal migrations might be especially informative, as we know relatively little regarding the nature of CHHs in terrestrial decapods, and hormonally mediated responses to seasonal changes in metabolic demands might also be superimposed or otherwise integrated with those associated with ionic homeostasis. Using Discoplax celeste as a model crab that experiences seasonal extremes in water availability, and exhibits diurnal and migratory activity patterns, we identified two CHHs in the sinus gland. We biochemically characterised (cDNA cloning) one CHH and functionally characterised (in terms of dose-dependent hyperglycaemic responses and glucose-dependent negative feedback loops) both CHHs. Whole-animal in situ branchial chamber 22NaCl perfusion experiments showed that injection of both CHHs increased gill Na+ uptake in a seasonally dependent manner, and 51Cr-EDTA clearance experiments demonstrated that CHH increased urine production by the antennal gland. Seasonal and salinity-dependent differences in haemolymph CHH titre further implicated CHH in osmoregulatory processes. Intriguingly, CHH appeared to have no effect on gill Na+/K+-ATPase or V-ATPase activity, suggesting unknown mechanisms of this hormone's action on Na+ transport across gill epithelia."},{"title":"Latitudinal comparison of thermotolerance and HSP70 production in F2 larvae of the greenshell mussel (Perna canaliculus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1202","abstract":"We report the first measures of thermotolerance (recorded as percentage mortality and induced HSP70 production) for pelagic larvae of three populations of the New Zealand greenshell (green-lipped) mussel Perna canaliculus. Our goal was to determine whether distinct populations of P. canaliculus were more susceptible to predicted climate change than others, and whether such patterns of susceptibility were either genetically controlled (local adaptation of populations) or simply reflect the acclimatory capacity of this species. F2 larvae from three P. canaliculus populations (D'Urville Island, Banks Peninsula and Stewart Island) were subjected to an acute thermal challenge (3 h exposure to a fixed temperature in the range 20–42°C). No latitudinal patterns in either percentage mortality or HSP70 protein production were apparent. For all populations, larval mortality (LT50) was between 32.9 and 33.9°C, with significant amounts of HSP70 induction only occurring in those individuals that experienced temperatures of 40°C or greater. The data presented therefore do not support the hypothesis that genetic adaptation of P. canaliculus to distinct thermal environments will be reflected by a corresponding difference in acute heat tolerance. In fact, the apparently vulnerable veligers show a surprisingly wide thermal safety margin. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the effects of ocean warming upon this species, subsequent studies should consider the impacts of sub-lethal stress upon fitness in addition to chronic thermal challenge and, crucially, the response of sedentary juvenile and adult stages."},{"title":"Adaptive beam-width control of echolocation sounds by CF–FM bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon, during prey-capture flight","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1210","abstract":"The echolocation sounds of Japanese CF–FM bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon) were measured while the bats pursued a moth (Goniocraspidum pryeri) in a flight chamber. Using a 31-channel microphone array system, we investigated how CF–FM bats adjust pulse direction and beam width according to prey position. During the search and approach phases, the horizontal and vertical beam widths were ±22±5 and ±13±5 deg, respectively. When bats entered the terminal phase approximately 1 m from a moth, distinctive evasive flight by G. pryeri was sometimes observed. Simultaneously, the bats broadened the beam widths of some emissions in both the horizontal (44% of emitted echolocation pulses) and vertical planes (71%). The expanded beam widths were ±36±7 deg (horizontal) and ±30±9 deg (vertical). When moths began evasive flight, the tracking accuracy decreased compared with that during the approach phase. However, in 97% of emissions during the terminal phase, the beam width was wider than the misalignment (the angular difference between the pulse and target directions). These findings indicate that bats actively adjust their beam width to retain the moving target within a spatial echolocation window during the final capture stages."},{"title":"Development of apical membrane organization and V-ATPase regulation in blowfly salivary glands","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1225","abstract":"Secretory cells in blowfly salivary gland are specialized via morphological and physiological attributes in order to serve their main function, i.e. the transport of solutes at a high rate in response to a hormonal stimulus, namely serotonin (5-HT). This study examines the way that 5-HT-insensitive precursor cells differentiate into morphologically complex 5-HT-responsive secretory cells. By means of immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoblotting and measurements of the transepithelial potential changes, we show the following. (1) The apical membrane of the secretory cells becomes organized into an elaborate system of canaliculi and is folded into pleats during the last pupal day and the first day of adulthood. (2) The structural reorganization of the apical membrane is accompanied by an enrichment of actin filaments and phosphorylated ERM protein (phospho-moesin) at this membrane domain and by the deployment of the membrane-integral part of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). These findings suggest a role for phospho-moesin, a linker between actin filaments and membrane components, in apical membrane morphogenesis. (3) The assembly and activation of V-ATPase can be induced immediately after eclosion by way of 8-CPT-cAMP, a membrane-permeant cAMP analogue. (4) 5-HT, however, produces the assembly and activation of V-ATPase only in flies aged for at least 2 h after eclosion, indicating that, at eclosion, the 5-HT receptor/adenylyl cyclase/cAMP signalling pathway is inoperative upstream of cAMP. (5) 5-HT activates both the Ca2+ signalling pathway and the cAMP signalling cascade in fully differentiated secretory cells. However, the functionality of these signalling cascades does not seem to be established in a tightly coordinated manner during cell differentation."},{"title":"Inorganic ion composition in Tardigrada: cryptobionts contain a large fraction of unidentified organic solutes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1235","abstract":"Many species of tardigrades are known to tolerate extreme environmental stress, yet detailed knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the remarkable adaptations of tardigrades is still lacking, as are answers to many questions regarding their basic biology. Here, we present data on the inorganic ion composition and total osmotic concentration of five different species of tardigrades (Echiniscus testudo, Milnesium tardigradum, Richtersius coronifer, Macrobiotus cf. hufelandi and Halobiotus crispae) using high-performance liquid chromatography and nanoliter osmometry. Quantification of the ionic content indicates that Na+ and Cl− are the principal inorganic ions in tardigrade fluids, albeit other ions, i.e. K+, NH4+, Ca2+, Mg2+, F−, SO42− and PO43− were also detected. In limno-terrestrial tardigrades, the respective ions are concentrated by a large factor compared with that of the external medium (Na+, ×70–800; K+, ×20–90; Ca2+ and Mg2+, ×30–200; F−, ×160–1040, Cl−, ×20–50; PO43−, ×700–2800; SO42−, ×30–150). In contrast, in the marine species H. crispae, Na+, Cl− and SO42− are almost in ionic equilibrium with (brackish) salt water, while K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and F− are only slightly concentrated (×2–10). An anion deficit of ~120 mEq l−1 in M. tardigradum and H. crispae indicates the presence of unidentified ionic components in these species. Body fluid osmolality ranges from 361±49 mOsm kg−1 in R. coronifer to 961±43 mOsm kg−1 in H. crispae. Concentrations of most inorganic ions are largely identical between active and dehydrated groups of R. coronifer, suggesting that this tardigrade does not lose large quantities of inorganic ions during dehydration. The large osmotic and ionic gradients maintained by both limno-terrestrial and marine species are indicative of a powerful ion-retentive mechanism in Tardigrada. Moreover, our data indicate that cryptobiotic tardigrades contain a large fraction of unidentified organic osmolytes, the identification of which is expected to provide increased insight into the phenomenon of cryptobiosis."},{"title":"Direct and correlated responses to laboratory selection for body melanisation in Drosophila melanogaster: support for the melanisation–desiccation resistance hypothesis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1244","abstract":"For Drosophila melanogaster, cuticular melanisation is a quantitative trait, varying from no melanin to completely dark. Variation in melanisation has been linked with stress resistance, especially desiccation, in D. melanogaster and other species. As melanism has a genetic component, we selected melanic and non-melanic phenotypes of D. melanogaster in order to confirm the association of desiccation resistance and rate of water loss with cuticular melanisation previously reported for this species. A bidirectional selection experiment for dark (D1–D4) and light (L1–L4) body colour in D. melanogaster was conducted for 60 generations. We observed a 1.6-fold increase in abdominal melanisation in selected dark strains and a 14-fold decrease in selected light strains compared with control populations. Desiccation resistance increased significantly in the dark-selected morphs as compared with controls. The observed increase in desiccation resistance appeared as a consequence of a decrease in cuticular permeability. Our results show that traits related to water balance were significantly correlated with abdominal melanisation and were simultaneously selected bidirectionally along with melanisation."},{"title":"Accelerometer tags: detecting and identifying activities in fish and the effect of sampling frequency","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1255","abstract":"Monitoring and measuring the behaviour and movement of aquatic animals in the wild is typically challenging, though micro-accelerometer (archival or telemetry) tags now provide the means to remotely identify and quantify behavioural states and rates such as resting, swimming and migrating, and to estimate activity and energy budgets. Most studies use low-frequency (≤32 Hz) accelerometer sampling because of battery and data-archiving constraints. In this study we assessed the effect of sampling frequency (aliasing) on activity detection probability using the great sculpin (Myoxocephalus polyacanthoceaphalus) as a model species. Feeding strikes and escape responses (fast-start activities) and spontaneous movements among seven different great sculpin were triggered, observed and recorded using video records and a tri-axial accelerometer sampling at 100 Hz. We demonstrate that multiple parameters in the time and probability domains can statistically differentiate between activities with high detection (90%) and identification (80%) probabilities. Detection probability for feeding and escape activities decreased by 50% when sampling at <10 Hz. Our analyses illustrate additional problems associated with aliasing and how activity and energy-budget estimates can be compromised and misinterpreted. We recommend that high-frequency (>30 Hz) accelerometer sampling be used in similar laboratory and field studies. If battery and/or data storage is limited, we also recommend archiving the events via an on-board algorithm that determines the highest likelihood and subsequent archiving of the various event classes of interest."},{"title":"miR-206 regulates the growth of the teleost tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) through the modulation of IGF-1 gene expression","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1265","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs that play a crucial role in regulating muscle development. Our previous study shows that miR-206 is specifically expressed in tilapia skeletal muscle, and exhibits a dynamic expression pattern at different developmental stages. Here, we reveal that miR-206 emerges as a crucial regulator of tilapia growth. miR-206 loss of function leads to the acceleration of tilapia growth. IGF-1 is identified as the target gene of miR-206. miR-206 directly changes IGF-1 expression by targeting its 3′ UTR, and inhibition of miR-206 substantially increases the IGF-1 mRNA level in vivo. Thus, miR-206 could be developed as a molecular marker to assist fish breeding."},{"title":"Feed-forward and visual feedback control of head roll orientation in wasps (Polistes humilis, Vespidae, Hymenoptera)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1280","abstract":"Flying insects keep their visual system horizontally aligned, suggesting that gaze stabilization is a crucial first step in flight control. Unlike flies, hymenopteran insects such as bees and wasps do not have halteres that provide fast, feed-forward angular rate information to stabilize head orientation in the presence of body rotations. We tested whether hymenopteran insects use inertial (mechanosensory) information to control head orientation from other sources, such as the wings, by applying periodic roll perturbations to male Polistes humilis wasps flying in tether under different visual conditions indoors and in natural outdoor conditions. We oscillated the thorax of the insects with frequency-modulated sinusoids (chirps) with frequencies increasing from 0.2 to 2 Hz at a maximal amplitude of 50 deg peak-to-peak and maximal angular velocity of ±245 deg s−1. We found that head roll stabilization is best outdoors, but completely absent in uniform visual conditions and in darkness. Step responses confirm that compensatory head roll movements are purely visually driven. Modelling step responses indicates that head roll stabilization is achieved by merging information on head angular velocity, presumably provided by motion-sensitive neurons and information on head orientation, presumably provided by light level integration across the compound eyes and/or ocelli (dorsal light response). Body roll in free flight reaches amplitudes of ±40 deg and angular velocities greater than 1000 deg s−1, while head orientation remains horizontal for most of the time to within ±10 deg. In free flight, we did not find a delay between spontaneous body roll and compensatory head movements, and suggest that this is evidence for the contribution of a feed-forward control to head stabilization."},{"title":"Spontaneous magnetic orientation in larval Drosophila shares properties with learned magnetic compass responses in adult flies and mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1307","abstract":"We provide evidence for spontaneous quadramodal magnetic orientation in a larval insect. Second instar Berlin, Canton-S and Oregon-R × Canton-S strains of Drosophila melanogaster exhibited quadramodal orientation with clusters of bearings along the four anti-cardinal compass directions (i.e. 45, 135, 225 and 315 deg). In double-blind experiments, Canton-S Drosophila larvae also exhibited quadramodal orientation in the presence of an earth-strength magnetic field, while this response was abolished when the horizontal component of the magnetic field was cancelled, indicating that the quadramodal behavior is dependent on magnetic cues, and that the spontaneous alignment response may reflect properties of the underlying magnetoreception mechanism. In addition, a re-analysis of data from studies of learned magnetic compass orientation by adult Drosophila melanogaster and C57BL/6 mice revealed patterns of response similar to those exhibited by larval flies, suggesting that a common magnetoreception mechanism may underlie these behaviors. Therefore, characterizing the mechanism(s) of magnetoreception in flies may hold the key to understanding the magnetic sense in a wide array of terrestrial organisms."},{"title":"The green leafhopper, Cicadella viridis (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha, Cicadellidae), jumps with near-constant acceleration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1270","abstract":"Jumping insects develop accelerations that can greatly exceed gravitational acceleration. Although several species have been analysed using different tools, ranging from a purely physical to a morpho-physiological approach, instantaneous dynamic and kinematic data concerning the jumping motion are lacking. This is mainly due to the difficulty in observing in detail events that occur in a few milliseconds. In this study, the behaviour of the green leafhopper, Cicadella viridis, was investigated during the take-off phase of the jump, through high-speed video recordings (8000 frames s−1). We demonstrate that C. viridis is able to maintain fairly constant acceleration during overall leg elongation. The force exerted at the foot–ground interface is nearly constant and differs from the force expected from other typical motion models. A biomechanical model was used to highlight that this ability relies on the morphology of C. viridis hind legs, which act as a motion converter with a variable transmission ratio and use the time-dependent musculo-elastic force to generate a nearly constant thrust at the body–ground interface. This modulation mechanism minimizes the risk of breaking the substrate thanks to the absence of force peaks. The results of this study are of broad relevance in different research fields ranging from biomechanics to robotics."},{"title":"The sugar meal of the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and how deterrent compounds interfere with it: a behavioural and neurophysiological study","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1292","abstract":"In this study, we show that female African malaria mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae starved for 3–5 h start to engorge on sucrose at concentrations between 50 and 75 mmol l−1. Half of the feeding response (ED50) is reached at 111 mmol l−1 and the maximum response (0.4 mg) occurs at 250 mmol l−1. Two receptor cells in a trichoid sensillum of the labellum, called the ‘sucrose’ and ‘water’ neurones, are activated by sucrose and water, respectively. The electrophysiological response of the sucrose receptor cell starts well below the level of sugar necessary to induce engorgement. The sugar receptor cell is most sensitive to small increments in sucrose concentration up to 10 mmol l−1 with a response plateau from 25 mmol l−1. Fructose has a mild phagostimulatory effect on A. gambiae, whereas no significant differences in meal sizes between water and glucose were found. However, when 146 mmol l−1 fructose plus glucose are mixed, the same engorgement as on 146 mmol l−1 sucrose is observed. Likewise, even though the sucrose receptor cell is not activated by either fructose or glucose alone, equimolar solutions of fructose plus glucose activate the neurone. We conclude that there is a behavioural and neurophysiological synergism between fructose and glucose, the two hexose sugars of sucrose. We show that some bitter-tasting products for humans have a deterrent effect on feeding in A. gambiae. When 1 mmol l−1 quinidine, quinine or denatonium benzoate is added to 146 mmol l−1 sucrose, feeding is almost totally inhibited. The effect of berberine is lower and no significant inhibition on engorgement occurs for caffeine. The deterrent effect depends on the concentration for both quinine and quinidine. Capillary feeding experiments show that contact chemosensilla on the mouthparts are sufficient for the detection of sucrose and bitter products. The feeding assay findings with deterrents correlate with the neurophysiological responses of the sucrose and water labellar neurones, which are both inhibited by the bitter compounds denatonium benzoate, quinine and berberine between 0.01 and 1 mmol l−1, but not by the same concentrations of caffeine. In conclusion, sucrose stimulates feeding and activates the labellar sucrose neurone, whereas feeding deterrents inhibit both the sucrose and water neurones. This study provides an initial understanding of the physiological mechanisms involved in sugar feeding in A. gambiae and shows how some bitter products interfere with it."},{"title":"Comparative spring mechanics in mantis shrimp","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1317","abstract":"Elastic mechanisms are fundamental to fast and efficient movements. Mantis shrimp power their fast raptorial appendages using a conserved network of exoskeletal springs, linkages and latches. Their appendages are fantastically diverse, ranging from spears to hammers. We measured the spring mechanics of 12 mantis shrimp species from five different families exhibiting hammer-shaped, spear-shaped and undifferentiated appendages. Across species, spring force and work increase with size of the appendage and spring constant is not correlated with size. Species that hammer their prey exhibit significantly greater spring resilience compared with species that impale evasive prey (‘spearers’); mixed statistical results show that species that hammer prey also produce greater work relative to size during spring loading compared with spearers. Disabling part of the spring mechanism, the ‘saddle’, significantly decreases spring force and work in three smasher species; cross-species analyses show a greater effect of cutting the saddle on the spring force and spring constant in species without hammers compared with species with hammers. Overall, the study shows a more potent spring mechanism in the faster and more powerful hammering species compared with spearing species while also highlighting the challenges of reconciling within-species and cross-species mechanical analyses when different processes may be acting at these two different levels of analysis. The observed mechanical variation in spring mechanics provides insights into the evolutionary history, morphological components and mechanical behavior, which were not discernible in prior single-species studies. The results also suggest that, even with a conserved spring mechanism, spring behavior, potency and component structures can be varied within a clade with implications for the behavioral functions of power-amplified devices."},{"title":"High muscle mitochondrial volume and aerobic capacity in a small marsupial (Sminthopsis crassicaudata) reveals flexible links between energy-use levels in mammals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/7/1330","abstract":"We investigated the muscle structure–function relationships that underlie the aerobic capacity of an insectivorous, small (~15 g) marsupial, Sminthopsis crassicaudata (Family: Dasyuridae), to obtain further insight into energy use patterns in marsupials relative to those in placentals, their sister clade within the Theria (advanced mammals). Disparate hopping marsupials (Suborder Macropodiformes), a kangaroo (Macropus rufus) and a rat-kangaroo (Bettongia penicillata), show aerobic capabilities as high as those of ‘athletic’ placentals. Equivalent muscle mitochondrial volumes and cardiovascular features support these capabilities. We examined S. crassicaudata to determine whether highly developed aerobic capabilities occur elsewhere in marsupials, rather than being restricted to the more recently evolved Macropodiformes. This was the case. Treadmill-trained S. crassicaudata attained a maximal aerobic metabolic rate (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/216/7/1330/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/> or MMR) of 272 ml O2 min−1 kg−1 (N=8), similar to that reported for a small (~20 g), ‘athletic’ placental, Apodemus sylvaticus, 264 ml O2 min−1 kg−1. Hopping marsupials have comparable aerobic levels when body mass variation is considered. Sminthopsis crassicaudata has a basal metabolic rate (BMR) about 75% of placental values but it has a notably large factorial aerobic scope (fAS) of 13; elevated fAS also features in hopping marsupials. The <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/216/7/1330/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/> of S. crassicaudata was supported by an elevated total muscle mitochondrial volume, which was largely achieved through high muscle mitochondrial volume densities, Vv(mt,f), the mean value being 14.0±1.33%. These data were considered in relation to energy use levels in mammals, particularly field metabolic rate (FMR). BMR is consistently lower in marsupials, but this is balanced by a high fAS, such that marsupial MMR matches that of placentals. However, FMR shows different mass relationships in the two clades, with the FMR of small (<125 g) marsupials, such as S. crassicaudata, being higher than that in comparably sized placentals, with the reverse applying for larger marsupials. The flexibility of energy output in marsupials provides explanations for this pattern. Overall, our data refute widely held notions of mechanistically closely linked relationships between body mass, BMR, FMR and MMR in mammals generally."},{"title":"Bumblebee calligraphy: the design and control of flight motifs in the learning and return flights of Bombus terrestris","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/1093","abstract":"Many wasps and bees learn the position of their nest relative to nearby visual features during elaborate ‘learning’ flights that they perform on leaving the nest. Return flights to the nest are thought to be patterned so that insects can reach their nest by matching their current view to views of their surroundings stored during learning flights. To understand how ground-nesting bumblebees might implement such a matching process, we have video-recorded the bees' learning and return flights and analysed the similarities and differences between the principal motifs of their flights. Loops that take bees away from and bring them back towards the nest are common during learning flights and less so in return flights. Zigzags are more prominent on return flights. Both motifs tend to be nest based. Bees often both fly towards and face the nest in the middle of loops and at the turns of zigzags. Before and after flight direction and body orientation are aligned, the two diverge from each other so that the nest is held within the bees' fronto-lateral visual field while flight direction relative to the nest can fluctuate more widely. These and other parallels between loops and zigzags suggest that they are stable variations of an underlying pattern, which enable bees to store and reacquire similar nest-focused views during learning and return flights."},{"title":"Single perturbations cause sustained changes in searching behavior in stick insects","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/1064","abstract":"Stick insects (Cuniculina impigra) possessing only a single front leg perform untargeted stereotypical cyclic searching movements with that leg when it loses contact with the ground. When encountering an object, the animals grasp it. We hypothesized that removal of the object immediately after contact with the leg's tibia would result in a change in searching strategy, i.e. searching movements confined to the former location of the object to regain contact. In our experimental setup, searching movements were restricted to upward and downward movements. After removal of the object, searching movements were continued. However, in post-contact searching, two movement parameters were usually changed: (1) average positions of searching movements were shifted towards the former position of the object; and (2) movement amplitudes were considerably smaller and accompanied by a decrease in cycle period. This confinement of searching movements to the location of contact was interpreted as targeting behavior. All parameters regained initial values after approximately 6 s. Changes in position and amplitudes were independently controlled. Neither of the changes was under visual control, but rather depended on the presence of the trochanteral hairplate, a sensory organ that measures the coxa–trochanter joint position. Changes in average leg position were linked to changes in the ratio of electrical activity in the levator and depressor trochanteris muscles, which were based on altered activity in both or either one of the muscles. Our data demonstrate a switch in a simple behavior that is under local sensory control and may utilize a form of short-term memory."},{"title":"Effect of fluid viscosity on the liquid-feeding flow phenomena of a female mosquito","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/952","abstract":"Liquid-sucking phenomena by the two-pump system of female mosquitoes were investigated to understand the feeding mechanism. In most previous experimental studies on liquid-feeding insects, the net increase of mass was divided by the feeding time and fluid density to evaluate the intake rate. However, this weighting method is not so precise for mosquitoes, because they are too lightweight to measure the gain of mass accurately. In this study, the intake rate of female mosquitoes feeding on various sucrose solutions was estimated using a micro-particle image velocimetry technique. As the sucrose concentration increased from 1% to 50%, the intake rate decreased from 17.3 to 5.8 nl s−1. In addition, the temporal volume variations of the two pump chambers were estimated based on the velocity and acceleration information of the flow at the center of the food canal of the proboscis. One pumping period was divided into four elementary phases, which are related to the different operational modes of the two pumps. According to the hypothetical model established in this study, the phase shift (Ɑ) between the two pump chambers increases from 14 to 28 ms and the percentage of reverse flow to forward flow in a pumping period decreases from 7.6% to 1.7% with increasing viscosity. The developed analytical methodology thus aids in the study of an insect's feeding mechanism."},{"title":"Condition-dependent auditory processing in the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus): links to sex, reproductive condition and female estrogen levels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/1075","abstract":"Neural responses to sensory stimuli often differ between sexes, vary seasonally, and can be regulated by endocrine activity, but the ecological and physiological mechanisms driving such patterns are not well understood. The current study examined how auditory function in the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), a vocal teleost, co-varied with sex, reproductive condition and female plasma 17β-estradiol level. Auditory evoked potentials were collected in response to tone pips (100–600 Hz) and a natural round goby pulse vocalization. Additionally, saccule hair cell densities were compared across reproductive groups. Auditory threshold was evaluated in terms of pressure and particle acceleration, and response amplitude and onset latency were measured at 10 dB above threshold. Relative to males, females displayed lower auditory thresholds in response to the natural vocalization and to tones at 300–600 Hz, and had a higher density of saccule hair cells. The 17β-estradiol level was positively associated with amplitude and latency for the pulse stimulus and with both threshold and amplitude for tones at 100–200 Hz in females. Relative to non-reproductive males, reproductive males exhibited longer response latencies at 100–200 Hz. The results demonstrate sexual dimorphism in auditory function in a teleost fish as well as intra-sexual variation, partially based on hormone levels. The current research further identifies links between auditory function and reproductive behaviors in fishes and provides a finer-scaled analysis of how this behavior is reflected at the level of the sensory systems facilitating signal reception."},{"title":"Sperm metabolism in pigs: a role for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/1085","abstract":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a nuclear hormone receptor expressed predominantly in adipose tissue, also implicated in energy homeostasis. In this study, we used western blotting and immunofluorescence techniques to demonstrate for the first time that pig spermatozoa express PPARγ. To investigate the functional role of PPARγ in pig sperm, we evaluated its action on different events that characterize the biology of sperm cells, i.e. motility, capacitation, viability and acrosome reaction, using the PPARγ-agonist 15-deoxy-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2). In responses to PGJ2 treatment, motility, cholesterol efflux and tyrosine phosphorylation were increased, which broadens the role of PPARγ from that previously described in the literature, as it also acts to improve sperm functionality. To further our understanding of the significance of PPARγ in pig sperm, we focused its effects on lipid and glucose metabolism. Evaluation of triglyceride content and lipase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and G6PDH activities suggests that PPARγ induces energy expenditure in pig spermatozoa. These data represent a meaningful advance in the field of sperm energy metabolism. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that PPARγ is expressed by pig sperm, thus improving its functionalities in terms of motility, capacitation, acrosome reaction, survival and metabolism."},{"title":"Lion (Panthera leo) and caracal (Caracal caracal) type IIx single muscle fibre force and power exceed that of trained humans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/960","abstract":"This study investigated for the first time maximum force production, shortening velocity (Vmax) and power output in permeabilised single muscle fibres at 12°C from lion, Panthera leo (Linnaeus 1758), and caracal, Caracal caracal (Schreber 1776), and compared the values with those from human cyclists.

On average, the felid type IIx fibres produced significantly greater force (191–211 kN m−2) and ~3 times more power (29.0–30.3 kN m−2 fibre lengths s−1) than the human IIax fibres (100–150 kN m−2, 4–11 kN m−2 fibre lengths s−1). Vmax values of the lion type IIx fibres were also higher than those of human type IIax fibres. The findings suggest that the same fibre type may differ substantially between species and potential explanations are discussed."},{"title":"Photo-orientation regulates seasonal habitat selection in the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/977","abstract":"Non-diapausing spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) live on the undersurface of host leaves during summer, but diapausing mites overwinter in dark hibernacula. The light environments of these habitats differ: visible radiation (VIS) but not ultraviolet radiation (UV) reaches the undersurface of leaves, but neither enters dark hibernacula. Thus, mites of either seasonal form could locate their preferred habitat by photo-orientation responses to UV and VIS. To investigate this possibility, we analysed the mites' locomotion behaviour on a virtual field with a programmed chequered pattern of light and dark patches in a micro-locomotion compensator. Both non-diapausing and diapausing mites moved away from UV-illuminated patches into dark patches. Non-diapausing mites moved towards VIS-illuminated patches, whereas diapausing mites did not show a preference. Our results show that non-diapausing mites avoid UV and are attracted to VIS, suggesting that this can guide them beneath a leaf. Diapausing mites simply avoid UV. The lack of a preference for VIS during diapause could be due to changes in carotenoid metabolism, which also involve orange pigmentation of diapausing mites. We consider that a diapause-mediated switch of the response to VIS, together with regular avoidance of UV, plays a key role in the seasonal change of habitat selection in this species. This seasonal polyphenism involves alterations in not only reproductive state and pigmentation, but also in photo-spectral responses."},{"title":"Anemonefish oxygenate their anemone hosts at night","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/970","abstract":"Many stony coral-dwelling fishes exhibit adaptations to deal with hypoxia among the branches of their hosts; however, no information exists on the respiratory ecophysiology of obligate fish associates of non-coral organisms such as sea anemones and sponges.

In the arthropod brain, the central complex (CC) receives highly preprocessed sensory information and sends outputs to premotor regions, suggesting that it may play a role in the central control of oriented locomotion. We performed tetrode recordings within the CC in cockroaches walking on an air-suspended ball to examine the role of the CC in turning behaviors. When a rod was placed near the cockroach's head, the cockroach touched the rod repeatedly with one or both antennae before locomotion was initiated. Some CC units responded to self-generated antennal contact with the object, but at lower levels compared with externally imposed antennal stimulation. The neural activity of other CC units responded to locomotion. We found that some CC units showed discrete firing fields corresponding to specific locomotion states. We also found that changes in firing rate of some CC units preceded changes in turning speed in one direction but not the other. Furthermore, such biased units were located in the side of the brain ipsilateral to the direction of the turning speed they could predict. Moreover, electrical stimulation of the CC elicited or modified locomotion, and the direction of some evoked locomotion could be predicted by the response property of locomotion-predictive units near the stimulation site. Therefore, our results suggest that, at the population level, asymmetrical activity in the CC precedes and influences turning behavior."},{"title":"The role of glucocorticoids in naturally fasting grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) pups: dexamethasone stimulates mass loss and protein utilisation, but not departure from the colony","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/984","abstract":"Seals must manage their energy reserves carefully while they fast on land to ensure that they go to sea with sufficient fuel to sustain them until they find food. Glucocorticoids (GCs) have been implicated in the control of fuel metabolism and termination of fasting in pinnipeds. Here we tested the hypothesis that dexamethasone, an artificial GC, increases fat and protein catabolism, and induces departure from the breeding colony in wild, fasting grey seal pups. A single intramuscular dose of dexamethasone completely suppressed cortisol production for 24–72 h, demonstrating activation of GC receptors. In experiment 1, we compared the effects of a single dose of dexamethasone or saline administered 10 days after weaning on fasting mass and body composition changes, cortisol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and glucose levels, and timing of departure from the colony. In experiment 2, we investigated the effects of dexamethasone on short-term (5 days) changes in mass loss, body composition and BUN levels. In experiment 1, dexamethasone induced a short-lived increase in mass loss, but there was no difference in timing of departure between dexamethasone- and saline-treated pups (N=10). In experiment 2, dexamethasone increased protein and water loss and prevented a decrease in BUN levels (N=11). Our data suggest changes in cortisol contribute to regulation of protein catabolism in fasting seal pups, irrespective of the sex of the animal, but do not terminate fasting. By affecting the rate of protein depletion, lasting changes in cortisol levels could influence the amount of time seal pups have to find food, and thus may have important consequences for their survival."},{"title":"Sensorimotor responsiveness and resolution in the giraffe","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/1003","abstract":"The ability of an animal to detect and respond to changes in the environment is crucial to its survival. However, two elements of sensorimotor control – the time required to respond to a stimulus (responsiveness) and the precision of stimulus detection and response production (resolution) – are inherently limited by a competition for space in peripheral nerves and muscles. These limitations only become more acute as animal size increases. In this paper, we investigated whether the physiology of giraffes has found unique solutions for maintaining sensorimotor performance in order to compensate for their extreme size. To examine responsiveness, we quantified three major sources of delay: nerve conduction delay, muscle electromechanical delay and force generation delay. To examine resolution, we quantified the number and size distribution of nerve fibers in the sciatic nerve. Rather than possessing a particularly unique sensorimotor system, we found that our measurements in giraffes were broadly comparable to size-dependent trends seen across other terrestrial mammals. Consequently, both giraffes and other large animals must contend with greater sensorimotor delays and lower innervation density in comparison to smaller animals. Because of their unconventional leg length, giraffes may experience even longer delays compared with other animals of the same mass when sensing distal stimuli. While there are certainly advantages to being tall, there appear to be challenges as well – our results suggest that giraffes are less able to precisely and accurately sense and respond to stimuli using feedback alone, particularly when moving quickly."},{"title":"Each to their own: skeletal muscles of different function use different biochemical strategies during aestivation at high temperature","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/1012","abstract":"Preservation of muscle morphology depends on a continuing regulatory balance between molecules that protect and molecules that damage muscle structural integrity. Excessive disruption of the biochemical balance that favours reactive oxygen species (ROS) in disused muscles may lead to oxidative stress, which in turn is associated with increased atrophic or apoptotic signalling and/or oxidative damage to the muscle and thus muscle disuse atrophy. Increases in the rate of oxygen consumption likely increase the overall generation of ROS in vivo. Temperature-induced increases in oxygen consumption rate occur in some muscles of ectotherms undergoing prolonged muscular disuse during aestivation. In the green-striped burrowing frog, Cyclorana alboguttata, both large jumping and small non-jumping muscles undergo atrophy seemingly commensurate with their rate of oxygen consumption during aestivation. However, because the extent of atrophy in these muscles is not enhanced at higher temperatures, despite a temperature-sensitive rate of oxygen consumption in the jumping muscle, we proposed that muscles are protected by biochemical means that, when mobilised at higher temperatures, inhibit atrophy. We proposed that the biochemical response to temperature would be muscle-specific. We examined the effect of temperature on the antioxidant and heat shock protein systems and determined the extent of oxidative damage to lipids and proteins in two functionally different skeletal muscles, the gastrocnemius (jumping muscle) and the iliofibularis (non-jumping muscle), by aestivating frogs at 24 and 30°C for 6 months. We assayed small molecule antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial and cytosolic superoxide dismutase activities and Hsp70 concentrations to show that protective mechanisms in disused muscles are differentially regulated with respect to both temperature and aestivation. High aestivation temperature results in an antioxidant response in the metabolically temperature-sensitive jumping muscle. We assayed lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation to show that oxidative damage is apparent during aestivation and its pattern is muscle-specific, but unaffected by temperature. Consideration is given to how the complex responses of muscle biochemistry inform the different strategies muscles may use in regulating their oxidative environment during extended disuse and disuse at high temperature."},{"title":"Ectopic eyes outside the head in Xenopus tadpoles provide sensory data for light-mediated learning","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/1031","abstract":"A major roadblock in the biomedical treatment of human sensory disorders, including blindness, has been an incomplete understanding of the nervous system and its ability to adapt to changes in sensory modality. Likewise, fundamental insight into the evolvability of complex functional anatomies requires understanding brain plasticity and the interaction between the nervous system and body architecture. While advances have been made in the generation of artificial and biological replacement components, the brain's ability to interpret sensory information arising from ectopic locations is not well understood. We report the use of eye primordia grafts to create ectopic eyes along the body axis of Xenopus tadpoles. These eyes are morphologically identical to native eyes and can be induced at caudal locations. Cell labeling studies reveal that eyes created in the tail send projections to the stomach and trunk. To assess function we performed light-mediated learning assays using an automated machine vision and environmental control system. The results demonstrate that ectopic eyes in the tail of Xenopus tadpoles could confer vision to the host. Thus ectopic visual organs were functional even when present at posterior locations. These data and protocols demonstrate the ability of vertebrate brains to interpret sensory input from ectopic structures and incorporate them into adaptive behavioral programs. This tractable new model for understanding the robust plasticity of the central nervous system has significant implications for regenerative medicine and sensory augmentation technology."},{"title":"Slow but tenacious: an analysis of running and gripping performance in chameleons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/1025","abstract":"Chameleons are highly specialized and mostly arboreal lizards characterized by a suite of derived characters. The grasping feet and tail are thought to be related to the arboreal lifestyle of chameleons, yet specializations for grasping are thought to exhibit a trade-off with running ability. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated a trade-off between running and clinging performance, with faster species being poorer clingers. Here we investigate the presence of trade-offs by measuring running and grasping performance in four species of chameleon belonging to two different clades (Chamaeleo and Bradypodion). Within each clade we selected a largely terrestrial species and a more arboreal species to test whether morphology and performance are related to habitat use. Our results show that habitat drives the evolution of morphology and performance but that some of these effects are specific to each clade. Terrestrial species in both clades show poorer grasping performance than more arboreal species and have smaller hands. Moreover, hand size best predicts gripping performance, suggesting that habitat use drives the evolution of hand morphology through its effects on performance. Arboreal species also had longer tails and better tail gripping performance. No differences in sprint speed were observed between the two Chamaeleo species. Within Bradypodion, differences in sprint speed were significant after correcting for body size, yet the arboreal species were both better sprinters and had greater clinging strength. These results suggest that previously documented trade-offs may have been caused by differences between clades (i.e. a phylogenetic effect) rather than by design conflicts between running and gripping per se."},{"title":"Three cone opsin genes determine the properties of the visual spectra in the Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus (Engraulidae, Teleostei)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/1041","abstract":"A complement of cone visual pigments was identified in the Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus, one of the engraulid fish species that has a retina specialized for polarization and color vision. The nature of the chromophore bound to opsin proteins was investigated using high performance liquid chromatography. The opsin genes were then cloned and sequenced, and the absorption spectra of different types of cones were obtained by microspectrophotometry. Two green (EJ-RH2-1, EJ-RH2-2) and one red (EJ-LWS) cone opsin genes were identified and are presumably related to the vitamin A1-based visual pigments (i.e. rhodopsins) with λmax values of 492, 474 and 512 nm, respectively. The long and short cones from the ventro-temporal retinal zone consisted of a pure population of RH2 class gene-based pigments (λmax=492 nm). The long and short cones from other retinal areas and the lateral components of the triple cones possessed a mixture of RH2 and LWS class gene-based pigments that exhibited a λmax of ~502 nm. The central component of the triple cones contained only RH2 class gene-based pigments (λmax=474 nm). Thus, E. japonicus possesses a middle-wave range of spectral sensitivity and acquires different color vision systems in distinct visual fields."},{"title":"Spatial memory and stereotypy of flight paths by big brown bats in cluttered surroundings","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/1053","abstract":"The big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, uses echolocation for foraging and orientation. The limited operating range of biosonar implies that bats must rely upon spatial memory in familiar spaces with dimensions larger than a few meters. Prior experiments with bats flying in obstacle arrays have revealed differences in flight and acoustic emission patterns depending on the density and spatial extent of the obstacles. Using the same method, combined with acoustic microphone array tracking, we flew big brown bats in an obstacle array that varied in density and distribution in different locations in the flight room. In the initial experiment, six bats learned individually stereotyped flight patterns as they became familiar with the space. After the first day, the repetition rate of sonar broadcasts dropped to a stable level, consistent with low-density clutter. In a second experiment, after acquiring their stable paths, each bat was released from each of two unfamiliar locations in the room. Each bat still followed the same flight path it learned originally. In a third experiment, performed 1 month after the first two experiments, three of the bats were re-flown in the same configuration of obstacles; these three resumed flying in their accustomed path. The other three bats were flown in a mirror-image reconfiguration of the obstacles; these bats quickly found stable flight paths that differed from their originally learned paths. Overall, the flight patterns indicate that the bats perceive the cluttered space as a single scene through which they develop globally organized flight paths."},{"title":"Coordinating compass-based and nest-based flight directions during bumblebee learning and return flights","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/1105","abstract":"Bumblebees tend to face their nest over a limited range of compass directions when learning the nest's location on departure and finding it on their approach after foraging. They thus obtain similar views of the nest and its surroundings on their learning and return flights. How do bees coordinate their flights relative to nest-based and compass-based reference frames to get such similar views? We show, first, that learning and return flights contain straight segments that are directed along particular compass bearings, which are independent of the orientation of a bee's body. Bees are thus free within limits to adjust their viewing direction relative to the nest, without disturbing flight direction. Second, we examine the coordination of nest-based and compass-based control during likely information gathering segments of these flights: loops during learning flights and zigzags on return flights. We find that bees tend to start a loop or zigzag when flying within a restricted range of compass directions and to fly towards the nest and face it after a fixed change in compass direction, without continuous interactions between their nest-based and compass-based directions of flight. A preferred trajectory of compass-based flight over the course of a motif, combined with the tendency of the bees to keep their body oriented towards the nest automatically narrows the range of compass directions over which bees view the nest. Additionally, the absence of interactions between the two reference frames allows loops and zigzags to have a stereotyped form that can generate informative visual feedback."},{"title":"Cellular damage as induced by high temperature is dependent on rate of temperature change – investigating consequences of ramping rates on molecular and organismal phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/809","abstract":"Ecological relevance and repeatability of results obtained in different laboratories are key issues when assessing thermal tolerance of ectotherms. Traditionally, assays have used acute exposures to extreme temperatures. The outcomes of ecologically more relevant ramping experiments, however, are dependent on the rate of temperature change leading to uncertainty of the causal factor for loss of function. Here, we test the physiological consequences of exposing female Drosophila melanogaster to gradually increasing temperatures in so-called ramping assays. We exposed flies to ramping at rates of 0.06 and 0.1°C min-1, respectively. Flies were sampled from the two treatments at 28, 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38°C and tested for heat tolerance and expression levels of the heat shock genes hsp23 and hsp70, as well as Hsp70 protein. Heat shock genes were upregulated more with a slow compared with a faster ramping rate, and heat knock-down tolerance was higher in flies exposed to the faster rate. The fact that slow ramping induces a stronger stress response (Hsp expression) compared with faster ramping suggests that slow ramping induces more heat damage at the cellular level due to longer exposure time. This is supported by the observation that fast ramped flies have higher heat knock-down tolerance. Thus we observed both accumulation of thermal damage at the molecular level and heat hardening at the phenotypic level as a consequence of heat exposure. The balance between these processes is dependent on ramping rate leading to the observed variation in thermal tolerance when using different rates."},{"title":"Nitric oxide signaling differentially affects habitat choice by two larval morphs of the sea slug Alderia willowi: mechanistic insight into evolutionary transitions in dispersal strategies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/6/1114","abstract":"In many marine animals, adult habitat is selected by lecithotrophic (non-feeding) larvae with a limited lifespan. In generalist species, larvae may increasingly accept sub-optimal habitat over time as energy stores are depleted (‘desperate larva’ hypothesis). If the fitness cost of suboptimal habitat is too high, larvae of specialists may prolong the searching phase until they encounter a high-quality patch or die (‘death before dishonor’ hypothesis). In generalists, starvation is hypothesized to lead to a decline in inhibitory nitric oxide (NO) signaling, thereby triggering metamorphosis. Here, we document alternative functions for identified signaling pathways in larvae having ‘desperate’ versus ‘death before dishonor’ strategies in lecithotrophic clutches of a habitat specialist, the sea slug Alderia willowi. In an unusual dimorphism, each clutch of A. willowi hatches both non-selective larvae that settle soon after hatching and siblings that delay settlement in the absence of cues from the alga Vaucheria, the sole adult food. Pharmacological manipulation of NO signaling induced metamorphosis in non-selective but not selective stages. However, decreased NO signaling in selective larvae lowered the threshold for response to habitat cues, mimicking the effect of declining energy levels. Manipulation of cGMP or dopamine production induced metamorphosis in selective and non-selective larvae alike, highlighting a distinct role for the NO pathway in the two larval morphs. We propose a model in which NO production (1) links nitrogen metabolism with sensory receptor signaling, and (2) shifts from a regulatory role in ‘desperate larva’ strategies to a modulatory role in ‘death before dishonor’ strategies. This study provides new mechanistic insight into how the function of conserved signaling pathways may change in response to selection on larval habitat choice behaviors."},{"title":"Multivariate analysis of behavioural response experiments in humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/759","abstract":"The behavioural response study (BRS) is an experimental design used by field biologists to determine the function and/or behavioural effects of conspecific, heterospecific or anthropogenic stimuli. When carrying out these studies in marine mammals it is difficult to make basic observations and achieve sufficient samples sizes because of the high cost and logistical difficulties. Rarely are other factors such as social context or the physical environment considered in the analysis because of these difficulties. This paper presents results of a BRS carried out in humpback whales to test the response of groups to one recording of conspecific social sounds and an artificially generated tone stimulus. Experiments were carried out in September/October 2004 and 2008 during the humpback whale southward migration along the east coast of Australia. In total, 13 ‘tone’ experiments, 15 ‘social sound’ experiments (using one recording of social sounds) and three silent controls were carried out over two field seasons. The results (using a mixed model statistical analysis) suggested that humpback whales responded differently to the two stimuli, measured by changes in course travelled and dive behaviour. Although the response to ‘tones’ was consistent, in that groups moved offshore and surfaced more often (suggesting an aversion to the stimulus), the response to ‘social sounds’ was highly variable and dependent upon the composition of the social group. The change in course and dive behaviour in response to ‘tones’ was found to be related to proximity to the source, the received signal level and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This study demonstrates that the behavioural responses of marine mammals to acoustic stimuli are complex. In order to tease out such multifaceted interactions, the number of replicates and factors measured must be sufficient for multivariate analysis."},{"title":"Shelter availability, stress level and digestive performance in the aspic viper","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/815","abstract":"The lack of shelter can perturb behaviors, increase stress level and thus alter physiological performance (e.g. digestive, immune or reproductive functions). Although intuitive, such potential impacts of lack of shelter remain poorly documented. We manipulated shelter availability and environmental and physiological variables (i.e. access to a heat source, predator attack, feeding status) in a viviparous snake, and assessed sun-basking behavior, digestive performance (i.e. digestive transit time, crude estimate of assimilation, regurgitation rate) and plasma corticosterone levels (a proxy of stress level). Shelter deprivation provoked a strong increase in sun-basking behavior and thus elevated body temperature, even in unfed individuals for which energy savings would have been otherwise beneficial. The lack of heat was detrimental to digestive performance; simulated predator attacks worsened the situation and entailed a further deterioration of digestion. The combination of the lack of shelter with cool ambient temperatures markedly elevated basal corticosterone level and was associated with low digestive performance. This hormonal effect was absent when only one negative factor was involved, suggesting a threshold response. Overall, our results revealed important non-linear cascading impacts of shelter availability on stress-hormone levels, behaviors and physiological performance. These results infer that shelter availability is important for laboratory studies, captive husbandry and possibly conservation plans."},{"title":"Temperature-dependent sex determination modulates cardiovascular maturation in embryonic snapping turtles Chelydra serpentina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/751","abstract":"We investigated sex differences in cardiovascular maturation in embryos of the snapping turtle Chelydra serpentina, a species with temperature-dependent sex determination.

Another group of eggs was incubated at 26.5°C until embryos reached stage 17; eggs were then shifted to 31°C for 6 days to produce females, and returned to 26.5°C for the rest of embryogenesis. Thus, males and females were at the same temperature when autonomic tone was determined and for most of development. Cholinergic blockade increased resting blood pressure (Pm) and heart rate (fH) in both sexes at 75% and 90% of incubation. However, the magnitude of the fH response was enhanced in males compared with females at 90% of incubation. β-adrenergic blockade increased Pm at 75% of incubation in both sexes but had no effect at 90% of incubation. β-adrenergic blockade reduced fH at both time points but produced a stronger response at 90% versus 75% of incubation. We found that α-adrenergic blockade decreased Pm in both sexes at 75% and 90% of incubation and decreased fH at 75% of incubation in both sexes. At 90% of incubation, fH decreased in females but not males. Although these data clearly demonstrate sexual dimorphism in the autonomic regulation of cardiovascular physiology in embryos, further studies are needed to test whether differences are caused by endocrine signals from gonads or by a hormone-independent temperature effect."},{"title":"Low-pass filters and differential tympanal tuning in a paleotropical bushcricket with an unusually low frequency call","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/777","abstract":"Low-frequency sounds are advantageous for long-range acoustic signal transmission, but for small animals they constitute a challenge for signal detection and localization. The efficient detection of sound in insects is enhanced by mechanical resonance either in the tracheal or tympanal system before subsequent neuronal amplification. Making small structures resonant at low sound frequencies poses challenges for insects and has not been adequately studied. Similarly, detecting the direction of long-wavelength sound using interaural signal amplitude and/or phase differences is difficult for small animals. Pseudophylline bushcrickets predominantly call at high, often ultrasonic frequencies, but a few paleotropical species use lower frequencies. We investigated the mechanical frequency tuning of the tympana of one such species, Onomarchus uninotatus, a large bushcricket that produces a narrow bandwidth call at an unusually low carrier frequency of 3.2 kHz. Onomarchus uninotatus, like most bushcrickets, has two large tympanal membranes on each fore-tibia. We found that both these membranes vibrate like hinged flaps anchored at the dorsal wall and do not show higher modes of vibration in the frequency range investigated (1.5–20 kHz). The anterior tympanal membrane acts as a low-pass filter, attenuating sounds at frequencies above 3.5 kHz, in contrast to the high-pass filter characteristic of other bushcricket tympana. Responses to higher frequencies are partitioned to the posterior tympanal membrane, which shows maximal sensitivity at several broad frequency ranges, peaking at 3.1, 7.4 and 14.4 kHz. This partitioning between the two tympanal membranes constitutes an unusual feature of peripheral auditory processing in insects. The complex tracheal shape of O. uninotatus also deviates from the known tube or horn shapes associated with simple band-pass or high-pass amplification of tracheal input to the tympana. Interestingly, while the anterior tympanal membrane shows directional sensitivity at conspecific call frequencies, the posterior tympanal membrane is not directional at conspecific frequencies and instead shows directionality at higher frequencies."},{"title":"Jumping mechanisms of treehopper insects (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha, Membracidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/788","abstract":"The kinematics and jumping performance of treehoppers (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha, Membracidae) were analysed from high speed images. The eight species analysed had an 11-fold range of body mass (3.8-41 mg) and a 2-fold range of body length (4.1-8.4 mm). Body shape was dominated by a prothoracic helmet that projected dorsally and posteriorly over the body, and in some species forwards to form a protruding horn. Jumping was propelled by rapid depression of the trochantera of the hindlegs. The hindlegs were only 30-60% longer than the front and middle legs, and 47-94% the length of the body in different species. They were slung beneath the body and moved together in the same plane. In preparation for a jump, the hindlegs were initially levated and rotated forwards so that the femora were pressed into indentations of the coxae. The tibiae were flexed about the femora and the tarsi were placed on the ground directly beneath the lateral edges of the abdomen. Movements of the front and middle legs adjusted the angle of the body relative to the ground, but for most treehoppers this angle was small, so that the body was almost parallel to the ground. The rapid depression of the hindlegs accelerated the body to take-off in 1.2 ms in the lighter treehoppers and 3.7 ms in the heavier ones. Take-off velocities of 2.1-2.7 m s-1 were achieved and were not correlated with body mass. In the best jumps, these performances involved accelerations of 560-2450 m s-2 (g forces of 47-250), an energy expenditure of 13.5-101 μJ, a power output of 12-32 mW and exerted a force of 9.5-29 mN. The power output per mass of muscle far exceeds the maximum active contractile limit of normal muscle. Such requirements indicate that treehoppers must be using a power amplification mechanism in a catapult-like action. Some jumps were preceded by flapping movements of the wings, but the propulsive movements of the hindlegs were crucial in achieving take-off."},{"title":"Phenotypic flexibility in migrating bats: seasonal variation in body composition, organ sizes and fatty acid profiles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/800","abstract":"Many species of bats migrate long distances, but the physiological challenges of migration are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that migration is physiologically demanding for bats by examining migration-related phenotypic flexibility. Both bats and birds are endothermic, flying vertebrates; therefore, we predicted that migration would result in similar physiological trade-offs. We compared hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) during spring migration and summer non-migratory periods, comparing our results with previous observations of birds. Migrating bats had reduced digestive organs, enlarged exercise organs, and fat stores had higher proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). These results are consistent with previous studies of migrating birds; however, we also found sex differences not typically associated with bird migration. Migrating female hoary bats increased the relative size of fat stores by reducing lean body components, while males maintained the same relative amount of fat in both seasons. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFA in flight muscle membrane increased in migrating males and decreased in migrating females, consistent with males using torpor more frequently than females during spring migration. Enlarged exercise organs, reduced digestive organs and changes in adipose tissue composition reflect the elevated energetic demands of migration. Sex-specific patterns of fat storage and muscle membrane composition likely reflect challenges faced by females that migrate while pregnant. Our results provide some of the first insights into the physiological demands of bat migration and highlight key differences between bats and birds."},{"title":"Kinematics of the ribbon fin in hovering and swimming of the electric ghost knifefish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/823","abstract":"Weakly electric knifefish are exceptionally maneuverable swimmers. In prior work, we have shown that they are able to move their entire body omnidirectionally so that they can rapidly reach prey up to several centimeters away. Consequently, in addition to being a focus of efforts to understand the neural basis of sensory signal processing in vertebrates, knifefish are increasingly the subject of biomechanical analysis to understand the coupling of signal acquisition and biomechanics. Here, we focus on a key subset of the knifefish's omnidirectional mechanical abilities: hovering in place, and swimming forward at variable speed. Using high-speed video and a markerless motion capture system to capture fin position, we show that hovering is achieved by generating two traveling waves, one from the caudal edge of the fin and one from the rostral edge, moving toward each other. These two traveling waves overlap at a nodal point near the center of the fin, cancelling fore–aft propulsion. During forward swimming at low velocities, the caudal region of the fin continues to have counter-propagating waves, directly retarding forward movement. The gait transition from hovering to forward swimming is accompanied by a shift in the nodal point toward the caudal end of the fin. While frequency varies significantly to increase speed at low velocities, beyond approximately one body length per second, the frequency stays near 10 Hz, and amplitude modulation becomes more prominent. A coupled central pattern generator model is able to reproduce qualitative features of fin motion and suggest hypotheses regarding the fin's neural control."},{"title":"Sexual dimorphism in the feeding mechanism of threespine stickleback","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/835","abstract":"Sexual dimorphism is common in nature and has the potential to increase intraspecific variation in performance and patterns of resource use. We sought to determine whether anadromous threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, exhibit sexual dimorphism in feeding kinematics. We filmed four males and four females consuming live prey in a total of 51 sequences filmed at 500 Hz, then tested for differences in cranial kinematics using a combination of principal component analysis and linear mixed models. We document, for the first time in fishes, divergence between males and females in both the timing of key movements and the magnitude of excursions reached by the hyoid, jaws and neurocranium during prey capture. Some of the largest differences are in jaw protrusion, with males exhibiting faster time to peak jaw protrusion but females exhibiting greater maximum jaw protrusion. Measurements of morphological jaw protrusion on cleared and stained specimens significantly predict jaw protrusion in kinematics. This morphological divergence could reflect ecological divergence between the sexes, or the demands of nest building and territory defense compromising male feeding performance. Remarkably, the morphological jaw protrusion divergence in anadromous males and females is similar to jaw protrusion divergence between ecomorphs in a benthic–limnetic species pair, with limnetics exhibiting female-like patterns of protrusion and benthics exhibiting male-like patterns. These results suggest that sexual dimorphism in feeding functional morphology exists in nature and may have played an important role in the radiation of threespine stickleback."},{"title":"Mechanical and energetic scaling relationships of running gait through ontogeny in the ostrich (Struthio camelus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/841","abstract":"It is unclear whether small animals, with their high stride frequency and crouched posture, or large animals, with more tendinous limbs, are more reliant on storage and return of elastic energy during locomotion. The ostrich has a limb structure that appears to be adapted for high-speed running with long tendons and short muscle fibres. Here we investigate biomechanics of ostrich gait through growth and, with consideration of anatomical data, identify scaling relationships with increasing body size, relating to forces acting on the musculoskeletal structures, effective mechanical advantage (EMA) and mechanical work. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected through growth from running ostriches. Joint moments scaled in a similar way to the pelvic limb segments as a result of consistent posture through growth, such that EMA was independent of body mass. Because no postural change was observed, relative loads applied to musculoskeletal tissues would be predicted to increase during growth, with greater muscle, and hence tendon, load allowing increased potential for elastic energy storage with increasing size. Mass-specific mechanical work per unit distance was independent of body mass, resulting in a small but significant increase in the contribution of elastic energy storage to locomotor economy in larger ostriches."},{"title":"Temperature-dependent behaviours are genetically variable in the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/850","abstract":"Temperature-dependent behaviours in Caenorhabditis elegans, such as thermotaxis and isothermal tracking, are complex behavioural responses that integrate sensation, foraging and learning, and have driven investigations to discover many essential genetic and neural pathways. The ease of manipulation of the Caenorhabditis model system also has encouraged its application to comparative analyses of phenotypic evolution, particularly contrasts of the classic model C. elegans with C. briggsae. And yet few studies have investigated natural genetic variation in behaviour in any nematode. Here we measure thermotaxis and isothermal tracking behaviour in genetically distinct strains of C. briggsae, further motivated by the latitudinal differentiation in C. briggsae that is associated with temperature-dependent fitness differences in this species. We demonstrate that C. briggsae performs thermotaxis and isothermal tracking largely similar to that of C. elegans, with a tendency to prefer its rearing temperature. Comparisons of these behaviours among strains reveal substantial heritable natural variation within each species that corresponds to three general patterns of behavioural response. However, intraspecific genetic differences in thermal behaviour often exceed interspecific differences. These patterns of temperature-dependent behaviour motivate further development of C. briggsae as a model system for dissecting the genetic underpinnings of complex behavioural traits."},{"title":"Dietary composition regulates Drosophila mobility and cardiac physiology","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/859","abstract":"The impact of dietary composition on exercise capacity is a subject of intense study in both humans and model organisms. Interactions between diet and genetics are a crucial component of optimized dietary design. However, the genetic factors governing exercise response are still not well understood. The recent development of invertebrate models for endurance exercise is likely to facilitate study designs examining the conserved interactions between diet, exercise and genetics. As a first step, we used the Drosophila model to describe the effects of varying dietary composition on several physiological indices, including fatigue tolerance and climbing speed, cardiac performance, lipid storage and autophagy. We found that flies of two divergent genetic backgrounds optimize endurance and cardiac performance on relatively balanced low calorie diets. When flies are provided with unbalanced diets, diets higher in sugar than in yeast facilitate greater endurance at the expense of cardiac performance. Importantly, we found that dietary composition has a profound effect on various physiological indices, whereas total caloric intake per se has very little predictive value for performance. We also found that the effects of diet on endurance are completely reversible within 48 h if flies are switched to a different diet."},{"title":"Serotonergic and cholinergic elements of the hypoxic ventilatory response in developing zebrafish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/869","abstract":"The chemosensory roles of gill neuroepithelial cells (NECs) in mediating the hyperventilatory response to hypoxia are not clearly defined in fish. While serotonin (5-HT) is the predominant neurotransmitter in O2-sensitive gill NECs, acetylcholine (ACh) plays a more prominent role in O2 sensing in terrestrial vertebrates. The present study characterized the developmental chronology of potential serotonergic and cholinergic chemosensory pathways of the gill in the model vertebrate, the zebrafish (Danio rerio). In immunolabelled whole gills from larvae, serotonergic NECs were observed in epithelia of the gill filaments and gill arches, while non-serotonergic NECs were found primarily in the gill arches. Acclimation of developing zebrafish to hypoxia (PO2=75 mmHg) reduced the number of serotonergic NECs observed at 7 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.), and this effect was absent at 10 d.p.f. In vivo administration of 5-HT mimicked hypoxia by increasing ventilation frequency (fV) in early stage (7–10 d.p.f.) and late stage larvae (14–21 d.p.f.), while ACh increased fV only in late stage larvae. In time course experiments, application of ketanserin inhibited the hyperventilatory response to acute hypoxia (PO2=25 mmHg) at 10 d.p.f., while hexamethonium did not have this effect until 12 d.p.f. Cells immunoreactive for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) began to appear in the gill filaments by 14 d.p.f. Characterization in adult gills revealed that VAChT-positive cells were a separate population of neurosecretory cells of the gill filaments. These studies suggest that serotonergic and cholinergic pathways in the zebrafish gill develop at different times and contribute to the hyperventilatory response to hypoxia."},{"title":"Social status-dependent modulation of LG-flip habituation in the crayfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/681","abstract":"Strong stimuli applied to the tailfan of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii evoked lateral giant interneurone (LG)-mediated tailflips. When the sensory stimulus was applied repeatedly, the response of the LG habituated until it failed to give rise to a spike. We found that this LG-flip habituation was dependent on social status. With a short interstimulus interval of 5 s, the rate of habituation of the LG in both socially dominant and subordinate crayfish was lower than that in socially isolated animals. By contrast, with a long interstimulus interval of 60 s, the rate of habituation of subordinate animals was lower than that of both socially isolated and dominant animals. The excitability of the LGs following habituation was also dependent on social status. Following habituation, the spike response of LGs recovered within several minutes; however, they showed significant depression with a decrease in excitability. With a 5 or 60 s interstimulus interval, subordinate animals showed longer delays of depression compared with dominant animals. A decrease in the rate of habituation and a delay of depression in subordinate crayfish would be advantageous for maintaining an active escape response to evade repeated attacks of dominant animals and a reduced learning ability to adapt to social status."},{"title":"Enhanced erythropoiesis in mice exposed to low environmental temperature","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/901","abstract":"Hematopoietic responses to environmental factors are not fully characterized. Polycythemia has been reported during exposure to low temperatures in ectothermic animals. The relationship between the causes of polycythemia and erythropoiesis during low temperature exposure is not fully understood. In this study, we exposed C57BL/6 mice to 5°C and monitored the blood cell counts and erythropoiesis. The hematocrit level increased from 45.6 to 52.2% after 14 days. Likewise, the hemoglobin concentration, initially 15.1 g dl–1, rose to 16.0 g dl–1. The reticulocyte production index significantly increased from 4 to 8% after 7 days. We examined the anatomy and cell composition of the spleens of the mice. On day 5, the spleens were ∼6 mg g–1 of body mass, which was twofold greater than the spleens on day 0. Flow cytometry showed fourfold more proerythroblasts on day 5, compared with day 0. Additionally, the number of late-stage mature erythroblasts increased on day 14. Erythropoietin mRNA levels increased in the kidneys, and hypoxia-inducible genes were enhanced in the kidney. Our findings indicated that low ambient temperature is a novel erythropoietic stress, which induces polycythemia by enhanced erythropoiesis."},{"title":"Protein kinase A-dependent and -independent activation of the V-ATPase in Malpighian tubules of Aedes aegypti","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/881","abstract":"Transepithelial ion transport in insect Malpighian tubules is energized by an apical V-ATPase. In hematophagous insects, a blood meal during which the animal ingests huge amounts of salt and water stimulates transepithelial transport processes linked to V-ATPase activation, but how this is accomplished is still unclear. Here we report that membrane-permeant derivatives of cAMP increase the bafilomycin-sensitive ATPase activity in Malpighian tubules of Aedes aegypti twofold and activate ATP-dependent transport processes. In parallel, membrane association of the V1 subunits C and D increases, consistent with the assembly of the holoenzyme. The protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 abolishes all cAMP-induced effects, consistent with protein kinase A (PKA) being involved in V-ATPase activation. Metabolic inhibition induced by KCN, azide and 2,4-dinitrophenol, respectively, also induces assembly of functional V-ATPases at the membrane without PKA involvement, indicating a phosphorylation-independent activation mechanism."},{"title":"Atmospheric propagation modeling indicates homing pigeons use loft-specific infrasonic ‘map’ cues","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/687","abstract":"Results from an acoustic ray-tracing program using daily meteorological profiles are presented to explain ‘release-site biases’ for homing pigeons at three experimental sites in upstate New York where W. T. Keeton and his co-workers at Cornell University conducted extensive releases between 1968 and 1987 in their investigations of the avian navigational ‘map’. The sites are the Jersey Hill and Castor Hill fire towers, and another near Weedsport, where control pigeons from the Cornell loft vanished in random directions, in directions consistently >50 deg clockwise and in directions ∼15 deg clockwise from the homeward bearing, respectively. Because Cornell pigeons were disoriented at Jersey Hill whereas birds from other lofts were not, it is inferred that Jersey Hill lies within an acoustic ‘shadow’ zone relative to infrasonic signals originating from the Cornell loft’s vicinity. Such signals could arise from ground-to-air coupling of near-continuous microseisms, or from scattering of direct microbaroms off terrain features, both of which are initially generated by wave–wave interactions in the deep ocean. HARPA runs show that little or no infrasound from the loft area arrived at Jersey Hill on days when Cornell pigeons were disoriented there, and that homeward infrasonic signals could have arrived at all three sites from directions consistent with pigeon departure bearings, especially on days when these bearings were unusual. The general stability of release-site biases might be due to influences of terrain on transmission of the homeward signals under prevailing weather patterns, whereas short-term changes in biases might be caused by rapid shifts in atmospheric conditions."},{"title":"Iodine accumulation in sea urchin larvae is dependent on peroxide","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/915","abstract":"Iodine has many important biological functions and its concentrations vary with the environment. Recent research has provided novel insights into iodine uptake mechanisms in marine bacteria and kelp through hydrogen peroxide-dependent diffusion (PDD). This mechanism is distinct from sodium-dependent mechanisms known from vertebrates. In vertebrates, iodine accumulates in the thyroid gland by the action of the apical iodide transporter (AIT) and the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS). Neither of these proteins has, thus far, been identified outside of the chordates, and PDD (as an iodine uptake mechanism) has never been studied in animals. Using 125I as a marker for total iodine influx, we tested iodine uptake via sodium-dependent transport versus PDD in embryos and larvae of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. We found that iodine uptake in S. purpuratus is largely independent of NIS/AIT. Instead, we found that uptake is dependent on the presence and production of hydrogen peroxide, indicating that sea urchin larvae use PDD as a mechanism for iodine acquisition. Our data, for the first time, provide conclusive evidence for this mechanism in an animal. Furthermore, our data provide preliminary evidence that sodium-dependent iodine uptake via active transporter proteins is a synapomorphy of vertebrates."},{"title":"Learning and memory in Rhodnius prolixus: habituation and aversive operant conditioning of the proboscis extension response","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/892","abstract":"It has been largely accepted that the cognitive abilities of disease vector insects may have drastic consequences on parasite transmission. However, despite the research effort that has been invested in the study of learning and memory in haematophagous insects, hitherto few conclusive results have been obtained. Adapting procedures largely validated in Drosophila, honeybees and butterflies, we demonstrate here that the proboscis extension response (PER) of the haematophagous insect Rhodnius prolixus can be modulated by non-associative (habituation) and associative (aversive conditioning) learning forms. Thermal stimuli were used as both unconditional stimulus (appetitive temperatures) and negative reinforcement (thermal shock). In the first part of this work, the PER was habituated and dishabituated to thermal stimuli, demonstrating the true central processing of information and discarding motor fatigue or sensory adaptation. Habituation was revealed to be modulated by the spatial context. In the second part, bugs that were submitted to aversive operant conditioning stopped responding with PER to thermal stimulation more quickly than by habituation. They were able to use their training experience when tested up to 72 h later. Our work constitutes the first demonstration of PER habituation and conditioning in a blood-sucking insect and provides reproducible experimental tools for the study of the mechanisms underlying learning and memory in disease vectors."},{"title":"The vestibuloocular reflex of tadpoles (Xenopus laevis) after knock-down of the isthmus-related transcription factor XTcf-4","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/733","abstract":"Development of the amphibian vestibular organ is regulated by molecular and neuronal mechanisms and by environmental input. The molecular component includes inductive signals derived from neural tissue of the hindbrain and from the surrounding mesoderm. The integrity of hindbrain patterning, on the other hand, depends on instructive signals from the isthmus organizer of the midbrain, including the transcription factor XTcf-4. If the development of the vestibular system depends on the integrity of the isthmus as the organizing centre, suppression of isthmus maintenance should modify vestibular morphology and function. We tested this hypothesis by downregulation of the transcription factor XTcf-4. 10 pmol l–1 XTcf-4-specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotide was injected in one blastomere of two-cell-stage embryos of Xenopus laevis. For reconstitution experiments, 500 pg mRNA of the repressing XTcf-4A isoform or the activating XTcf-4C isoform were co-injected. Overexpression experiments were included using the same isoforms. Otoconia formation and vestibular controlled behaviour such as the roll-induced vestibuloocular reflex (rVOR) and swimming were recorded two weeks later. In 50% of tadpoles, downregulation of XTcf-4 induced (1) a depression of otoconia formation accompanied by a reduction of the rVOR, (2) abnormal tail development and (3) loop swimming behaviour. (4) All effects were rescued by co-injection of XTcf-4C but not, or only partially, by XTcf-4A. (5) Overexpression of XTcf-4A caused similar morphological and rVOR modifications as XTcf-4 depletion, while overexpression of XTcf-4C had no effect. Because XTcf-4C has been described as an essential factor for isthmus development, we postulate that the isthmus is strongly involved in vestibular development."},{"title":"Condition-dependent strategies of eggshell pigmentation: an experimental study of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/700","abstract":"A relationship has been suggested between eggshell colour and female body condition based on the opposing antioxidant properties of the two main eggshell pigments: the antioxidant biliverdin (blue–green) and the pro-oxidant protoporphyrin (brown). We hypothesized that experimentally food-restricted females with low antioxidant capacity would deposit more protoporphyrin and less biliverdin in their eggshells, resulting in eggshells of reduced brightness but increased colour intensity. Two eggs were collected at the beginning and two at the end of a 2 week period from each of 24 female Japanese quails that were either food restricted or receiving ad libitum food (i.e. controls) during that time. Reflectance spectra were recorded and analysed using spectral shape descriptors, chromatic and achromatic contrasts were computed accounting for avian visual sensitivities, and eggshell pigments were quantified. We examined both spot and background pigmentation and found no significant effect of food restriction on eggshell reflectance. However, food-restricted females in lower body condition increased the deposition of protoporphyrin and decreased the amount of biliverdin invested in their eggshells. We hypothesize that in species laying brown-spotted eggshells, females modulate eggshell pigment investment in response to their body condition. According to this hypothesis, we predict that females maintain eggshell colour to limit visible changes that could be detected by predators and thereby conceal their eggs, although this work has yet to be conducted. We suggest that further experimental work on egg camouflage under different environmental conditions will elaborate on the process of pigment deposition and the physiological costs to females of laying heavily pigmented eggshells."},{"title":"Physiological and agonistic behavioural response of Procambarus clarkii to an acoustic stimulus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/709","abstract":"This study examined the effects of an acoustic stimulus on the haemolymph and agonistic behaviour of the red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii.

For flying fruit flies, recent experiments indicate that flies actively steer away from patterns of expansion. Whereas such a reflex makes sense for avoiding obstacles, it presents a paradox of sorts because an insect could not navigate stably through a visual scene unless it tolerated flight towards a focus of expansion during episodes of forward translation. One possible solution to this paradox is that a fly’s behavior might change such that it steers away from strong expansion, but actively steers towards weak expansion. In this study, we use a tethered flight arena to investigate the influence of stimulus strength on the magnitude and direction of turning responses to visual expansion in flies. These experiments indicate that the expansion-avoidance behavior is speed dependent. At slower speeds of expansion, flies exhibit an attraction to the focus of expansion, whereas the behavior transforms to expansion avoidance at higher speeds. Open-loop experiments indicate that this inversion of the expansion-avoidance response depends on whether or not the head is fixed to the thorax. The inversion of the expansion-avoidance response with stimulus strength has a clear manifestation under closed-loop conditions. Flies will actively orient towards a focus of expansion at low temporal frequency but steer away from it at high temporal frequency. The change in the response with temporal frequency does not require motion stimuli directly in front or behind the fly. Animals in which the stimulus was presented within 120 deg sectors on each side consistently steered towards expansion at low temporal frequency and steered towards contraction at high temporal frequency. A simple model based on an array of Hassenstein–Reichardt type elementary movement detectors suggests that the inversion of the expansion-avoidance reflex can explain the spatial distribution of straight flight segments and collision-avoidance saccades when flies fly freely within an open circular arena."},{"title":"Pronounced heritable variation and limited phenotypic plasticity in visual pigments and opsin expression of threespine stickleback photoreceptors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/656","abstract":"Vertebrate colour vision is mediated by the differential expression of visual pigment proteins (opsins) in retinal cone photoreceptors. Many species alter opsin expression during life, either as part of development or as a result of changes in habitat. The latter, a result of phenotypic plasticity, appears common among fishes, but its cellular origin and ecological significance are unknown. Here, we used adult threespine stickleback fish from different photic regimes to investigate heritable variability and phenotypic plasticity in opsin expression. Fish from clear waters had double cones that expressed long (LWS) and middle (RH2) wavelength opsins, one per double cone member. In contrast, fish from red light-shifted lakes had double cones that were >95% LWS/LWS pairs. All fish had single cones that predominantly expressed a short wavelength (SWS2) opsin but ultraviolet cones, expressing a SWS1 opsin, were present throughout the retina. Fish from red light-shifted lakes, when transferred to clear waters, had a ∼2% increase in RH2/LWS double cones, though double cone density remained constant. Comparison of visual pigment absorbance and light transmission in the environment indicated that the opsin complements of double cones maximized sensitivity to the background light, whereas single cones had visual pigments that were spectrally offset from the dominant background wavelengths. Our results indicate that phenotypic plasticity in opsin expression is minor in sticklebacks and of questionable functional significance."},{"title":"Information content of visual scenes influences systematic search of desert ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/742","abstract":"Many animals – including insects – navigate visually through their environment. Solitary foraging desert ants are known to acquire visual information from the surrounding panorama and use it to navigate along habitual routes or to pinpoint a goal such as the nest. Returning foragers that fail to find the nest entrance engage in searching behaviour, during which they continue to use vision. The characteristics of searching behaviour have typically been investigated in unfamiliar environments. Here we investigated in detail the nest-searching behaviour of Melophorus bagoti foragers within the familiar visual environment of their nest. First, by relating search behaviour to the information content of panoramic (360 deg) images, we found that searches were more accurate in visually cluttered environments. Second, as observed in unfamiliar visual surrounds, searches were dynamic and gradually expanded with time, showing that nest pinpointing is not rigidly controlled by vision. Third, contrary to searches displayed in unfamiliar environments, searches observed here could be modelled as a single exponential search strategy, which is similar to a Brownian walk, and there was no evidence of a Lévy walk. Overall, our results revealed that searching behaviour is remarkably flexible and varies according to the relevance of information provided by the surrounding visual scenery."},{"title":"Species-specific recognition of the carrier insect by dauer larvae of the nematode Caenorhabditis japonica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/568","abstract":"Host recognition is crucial during the phoretic stage of nematodes because it facilitates their association with hosts. However, limited information is available on the direct cues used for host recognition and host specificity in nematodes. Caenorhabditis japonica forms an intimate association with the burrower bug Parastrachia japonensis. Caenorhabditis japonica dauer larvae (DL), the phoretic stage of the nematode, are mainly found on adult P. japonensis females but no other species. To understand the mechanisms of species-specific and female carrier-biased ectophoresy in C. japonica, we investigated whether C. japonica DL could recognize their hosts using nematode loading and chemoattraction experiments. During the loading experiments, up to 300 C. japonica DL embarked on male and female P. japonensis, whereas none or very few utilized the other shield bugs Erthesina fullo and Macroscytus japonensis or the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare. In the chemoattraction experiments, hexane extracts containing the body surface components of nymphs and both adult P. japonensis sexes attracted C. japonica DL, whereas those of other shield bugs did not. Parastrachia japonensis extracts also arrested the dispersal of C. japonica DL released at a site where hexane extracts were spotted on an agar plate; i.e. >50% of DL remained at the site even 60 min after nematode inoculation whereas M. japonensis extracts or hexane alone did not have the same effect. These results suggest that C. japonica DL recognize their host species using direct chemical attractants from their specific host to maintain their association."},{"title":"ACTH-stimulated cortisol release from head kidney of rainbow trout is modulated by glucose concentration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/554","abstract":"To assess the hypothesis that cortisol release in rainbow trout is modulated by glucose levels, we first evaluated cortisol release [basal and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-regulated] by head kidney tissue superfused with medium reflecting hypoglycaemic, normoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic conditions. Next, cortisol release from head kidney fragments in static incubations was assessed in parallel with changes in parameters related to cortisol synthesis (mRNA abundance of StAR, P450scc, 3βHSD and 11βH) and the GK-mediated glucosensing mechanism (levels of glycogen and glucose, activities of GK, GSase and PK, and mRNA levels of GK, GLUT-2, Kir6.x-like and SUR-like). We then evaluated the effects of two inhibitors of glucose transport, cytochalasin B and phlorizin, on cortisol production and glucosensing mechanisms. The ACTH-induced release of cortisol proved to be modulated by glucose concentration such that increased release occurs under high glucose levels, and decreased ACTH-stimulated cortisol release occurs when glucose transport is inhibited by cytochalasin B. The release of cortisol can be associated with increased synthesis as enhanced mRNA abundance of genes related to cortisol synthesis was also noted in high glucose medium. Specific GK immunoreactivity in the cortisol-producing cells (not in chromaffin cells) further substantiates GK-mediated glucosensing in cortisol production. In contrast, no changes compatible with those of glucose levels and cortisol release/synthesis in the presence of ACTH were noted for any other putative glucosensor mechanisms based on LXR, SGLT-1 or Gnat3. These combined results are the first evidence for a mechanism in fish linking the synthesis and release of a non-pancreatic hormone like cortisol with circulating glucose levels. The relationship was evident for the regulated (ACTH-dependent) pathway and this suggests that under acute stress conditions glucose is important for the regulation of cortisol synthesis and release."},{"title":"A conserved role for the 20S proteasome and Nrf2 transcription factor in oxidative stress adaptation in mammals, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/543","abstract":"In mammalian cells, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced adaptation to oxidative stress is strongly dependent on an Nrf2 transcription factor-mediated increase in the 20S proteasome.

As in mammalian cells, this adaptive response in worms and flies involves an increase in proteolytic activity and increased expression of the 20S proteasome, but not of the 26S proteasome. We also found that the increase in 20S proteasome expression in both worms and flies, as in mammalian cells, is important for the adaptive response, and that it is mediated by the SKN-1 and CNC-C orthologs of the mammalian Nrf2 transcription factor, respectively. These studies demonstrate that stress mechanisms operative in cell culture also apply in disparate intact organisms across a wide biological diversity."},{"title":"Forelimb kinematics during swimming in the pig-nosed turtle, Carettochelys insculpta, compared with other turtle taxa: rowing versus flapping, convergence versus intermediacy","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/668","abstract":"Animals that swim using appendages do so by way of rowing and/or flapping motions. Often considered discrete categories, rowing and flapping are more appropriately regarded as points along a continuum. The pig-nosed turtle, Carettochelys insculpta, is unusual in that it is the only freshwater turtle to have limbs modified into flippers and swim via synchronous forelimb motions that resemble dorsoventral flapping, traits that evolved independently from their presence in sea turtles. We used high-speed videography to quantify forelimb kinematics in C. insculpta and a closely related, highly aquatic rower (Apalone ferox). Comparisons of our new data with those previously collected for a generalized freshwater rower (Trachemys scripta) and a flapping sea turtle (Caretta caretta) allow us to: (1) more precisely quantify and characterize the range of limb motions used by flappers versus rowers, and (2) assess whether the synchronous forelimb motions of C. insculpta can be classified as flapping (i.e. whether they exhibit forelimb kinematics and angles of attack more similar to closely related rowing species or more distantly related flapping sea turtles). We found that the forelimb kinematics of previously recognized rowers (T. scripta and A. ferox) were most similar to each other, but that those of C. insculpta were more similar to rowers than to flapping C. caretta. Nevertheless, of the three freshwater species, C. insculpta was most similar to flapping C. caretta. ‘Flapping’ in C. insculpta is achieved through humeral kinematics very different from those in C. caretta, with C. insculpta exhibiting significantly more anteroposterior humeral motion and protraction, and significantly less dorsoventral humeral motion and depression. Based on several intermediate kinematic parameters and angle of attack data, C. insculpta may in fact represent a synchronous rower or hybrid rower-flapper, suggesting that traditional views of C. insculpta as a flapper should be revised."},{"title":"Waking to drink: rates of evaporative water loss determine arousal frequency in hibernating bats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/573","abstract":"Bats hibernate to cope with low ambient temperatures (Ta) and low food availability during winter. However, hibernation is frequently interrupted by arousals, when bats increase body temperature (Tb) and metabolic rate (MR) to normothermic levels.

This has been associated with variation in Tb, Ta or both, leading to a single testable prediction, i.e. that torpor bout length (TBL) is negatively correlated with Ta and Tb. Ta and Tb were both found to be correlated with TBL, but correlations alone cannot establish a causal link between arousal and Tb or Ta. Because hydration state has also been implicated in arousals from hibernation, we hypothesized that water loss during hibernation creates the need in bats to arouse to drink. We measured TBL of bats (Pipistrellus kuhlii) at the same Ta but under different conditions of humidity, and found an inverse relationship between TBL and total evaporative water loss, independent of metabolic rate, which directly supports the hypothesis that hydration state is a cue to arousal in bats."},{"title":"The energy cost of voluntary running in the weasel Mustela nivalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/578","abstract":"The small size and elongate shape of weasels (Mustela nivalis) probably evolved to facilitate movement within the burrow systems of prey species, but result in high energy costs of thermoregulation. In this study we measured metabolic rates of weasels during voluntary locomotion to determine whether energy costs of transport are also high in these unusually shaped mammals. In addition, we measured the lower and upper limits of aerobic metabolism [resting metabolic rate (RMR) and maximal oxygen consumption in forced exercise (V̇O2,max)], and used the wide size range of adult weasels to investigate the intraspecific scaling of energy metabolism. Finally, we combined measurements of energy use during running with radiotracking and doubly labeled water data from free-living weasels to estimate the importance of locomotor costs in daily energy budgets. We found that weasels have higher than predicted costs of running, largely because of an elevated intercept of the speed versus metabolic rate relationship. Running costs were strongly affected by the approximately fourfold range of body size in adults. As reported in other studies, the RMR of weasels was considerably higher than predicted from body mass. Maximal oxygen consumption was also higher than predicted, but factorial aerobic scope (V̇O2,max/RMR) was within the normal range for mammals. Intraspecific mass scaling of RMR and V̇O2,max did not differ from typical interspecific mammalian allometries. In wild weasels, locomotor costs comprised roughly 5% of daily energy expenditures; this low value was primarily a result of short travel times and distances."},{"title":"More than a feeling: incidental learning of array geometry by blindfolded adult humans revealed through touch","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/587","abstract":"View-based matching theories of orientation suggest that mobile organisms encode a visual memory consisting of a visual panorama from a target location and maneuver to reduce discrepancy between current visual perception and this stored visual memory to return to a location. Recent success of such theories to explain the orientation behavior of insects and birds raises questions regarding the extent to which such an explanation generalizes to other species. In the present study, we attempted to determine the extent to which such view-based matching theories may explain the orientation behavior of a mammalian species (in this case adult humans). We modified a traditional enclosure orientation task so that it involved only the use of the haptic sense. The use of a haptic orientation task to investigate the extent to which view-based matching theories may explain the orientation behavior of adult humans appeared ideal because it provided an opportunity for us to explicitly prohibit the use of vision. Specifically, we trained disoriented and blindfolded human participants to search by touch for a target object hidden in one of four locations marked by distinctive textural cues located on top of four discrete landmarks arranged in a rectangular array. Following training, we removed the distinctive textural cues and probed the extent to which participants learned the geometry of the landmark array. In the absence of vision and the trained textural cues, participants showed evidence that they learned the geometry of the landmark array. Such evidence cannot be explained by an appeal to view-based matching strategies and is consistent with explanations of spatial orientation related to the incidental learning of environmental geometry."},{"title":"Differential strain patterns of the human Achilles tendon determined in vivo with freehand three-dimensional ultrasound imaging","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/594","abstract":"The human Achilles tendon (AT) has often been considered to act as a single elastic structure in series with the muscles of the triceps surae. As such it has been commonly modelled as a Hookean spring of uniform stiffness. However, the free AT and the proximal AT have distinctly different structures that lend themselves to different elastic properties. This study aimed to use three-dimensional freehand ultrasound imaging to determine whether the proximal AT and the free AT exhibit different elastic behaviour during sub-maximal, fixed-end contractions of the triceps surae. Six male and five female participants (mean ± s.d. age=27±5 years) performed fixed position contractions of the plantar-flexors on an isokinetic dynamometer at 50% of their maximum voluntary contraction in this position. Freehand three-dimensional ultrasound imaging was used to reconstruct the free-tendon and proximal AT at rest and during contraction. The free-tendon exhibited significantly (P=0.03) greater longitudinal strain (5.2±1.7%) than the proximal AT (2.6±2.0%). The lesser longitudinal strain of the proximal AT was linked to the fact that it exhibited considerable transverse (orthogonal to the longitudinal direction) strains (5.0±4%). The transverse strain of the proximal AT is likely due to the triceps surae muscles bulging upon contraction, and thus the level of bulging may influence the elastic behaviour of the proximal AT. This might have implications for the understanding of triceps surae muscle–tendon interaction during locomotion, tendon injury mechanics and previous measurements of AT elastic properties."},{"title":"Antioxidant and molecular chaperone defences during estivation and arousal in the South American apple snail Pomacea canaliculata","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/614","abstract":"The invasive Pomacea canaliculata estivates during periods of drought and should cope with harmful effects of reoxygenation during arousal.

Both kidney and foot (but not the midgut gland) showed a TBARS increase during estivation and a decrease after arousal. Tissue SOD and CAT did not change in any experimental groups. Uric acid increased during estivation in all tissues, and it decreased after arousal in the kidney. Allantoin, the oxidation product of uric acid, remained constant in the midgut gland but it decreased in the kidney until 20 min after arousal; however, allantoin levels rose in both kidney and foot 24 h after arousal. Reduced glutathione decreased during estivation and arousal, in both midgut gland and kidney, and it remained constant in the foot. Hsc70 and Hsp70 kidney levels were stable during the activity–estivation cycle and Hsp90 expression decreases during estivation and recovers in the early arousal. In foot, the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 was high during activity and estivation periods and disminished after arousal. Results indicate that a panoply of antioxidant and molecular chaperone defences may be involved during the activity–estivation cycle in this freshwater gastropod."},{"title":"Cardioacceleratory function of the neurohormone CCAP in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/601","abstract":"Crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) is a highly conserved arthropod neurohormone that is involved in ecdysis, hormone release and the modulation of muscle contractions. Here, we determined the CCAP gene structure in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, assessed the developmental expression of CCAP and its receptor and determined the role that CCAP plays in regulating mosquito cardiac function. RACE sequencing revealed that the A. gambiae CCAP gene encodes a neuropeptide that shares 100% amino acid identity with all sequenced CCAP peptides, with the exception of Daphnia pulex. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of CCAP and the CCAP receptor displays a bimodal distribution, with peak mRNA levels in second instar larvae and pupae. Injection of CCAP revealed that augmenting hemocoelic CCAP levels in adult mosquitoes increases the anterograde and retrograde heart contraction rates by up to 28%, and increases intracardiac hemolymph flow velocities by up to 33%. Partial CCAP knockdown by RNAi had the opposite effect, decreasing the mosquito heart rate by 6%. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments showed that CCAP mRNA is enriched in the head region, and immunohistochemical experiments in newly eclosed mosquitoes detected CCAP in abdominal neurons and projections, some of which innervated the heart, but failed to detect CCAP in the abdomens of older mosquitoes. Instead, in older mosquitoes CCAP was detected in the pars lateralis, the subesophageal ganglion and the corpora cardiaca. In conclusion, CCAP has a potent effect on mosquito circulatory physiology, and thus heart physiology in this dipteran insect is under partial neuronal control."},{"title":"Mechanisms of transepithelial ammonia excretion and luminal alkalinization in the gut of an intestinal air-breathing fish, Misgurnus anguilliacaudatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/623","abstract":"The weatherloach, Misgurnus angulliacaudatus, is an intestinal air-breathing, freshwater fish that has the unique ability to excrete ammonia through gut volatilization when branchial and cutaneous routes are compromised during high environmental ammonia or air exposure. We hypothesized that transepithelial gut NH4+ transport is facilitated by an apical Na+/H+ (NH4+) exchanger (NHE) and a basolateral Na+/K+(NH4+)-ATPase, and that gut boundary layer alkalinization (NH4+ → NH3 + H+) is facilitated by apical HCO3– secretion through a Cl–/HCO3– anion exchanger. This was tested using a pharmacological approach with anterior (digestive) and posterior (respiratory) intestine preparations mounted in pH-stat-equipped Ussing chambers. The anterior intestine had a markedly higher conductance, increased short-circuit current, and greater net base (Jbase) and ammonia excretion rates (Jamm) than the posterior intestine. In the anterior intestine, HCO3– accounted for 70% of Jbase. In the presence of an imposed serosal–mucosal ammonia gradient, inhibitors of both NHE (EIPA, 0.1 mmol l–1) and Na+/K+-ATPase (ouabain, 0.1 mmol l–1) significantly inhibited Jamm in the anterior intestine, although only EIPA had an effect in the posterior intestine. In addition, the anion exchange inhibitor DIDS significantly reduced Jbase in the anterior intestine although only at a high dose (1 mmol l–1). Carbonic anhydrase does not appear to be associated with gut alkalinization under these conditions as ethoxzolamide was without effect on Jbase. Membrane fluidity of the posterior intestine was low, suggesting low permeability, which was also reflected in a lower mucosal–serosal Jamm in the presence of an imposed gradient, in contrast to that in the anterior intestine. To conclude, although the posterior intestine is highly modified for gas exchange, it is the anterior intestine that is the likely site of ammonia excretion and alkalinization leading to ammonia volatilization in the gut."},{"title":"Humoral immune responses are maintained with age in a long-lived ectotherm, the red-eared slider turtle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/633","abstract":"Aging is typically associated with a decrease in immune function. However, aging does not affect each branch of the immune system equally. Because of these varying effects of age on immune responses, aging could affect taxa differently based on how the particular taxon employs its resources towards different components of immune defense. An example of this is found in the humoral immune system. Specific responses tend to decrease with age while non-specific, natural antibody responses increase with age. Compared with mammals, reptiles of all ages have a slower and less robust humoral immune system. Therefore, they may invest more in non-specific responses and thus avoid the negative consequences of age on the immune system. We examined how the humoral immune system of reptiles is affected by aging and investigated the roles of non-specific, natural antibody responses and specific responses by examining several characteristics of antibodies against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the red-eared slider turtle. We found very little evidence of immunosenescence in the humoral immune system of the red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta, which supports the idea that non-specific, natural antibody responses are an important line of defense in reptiles. Overall, this demonstrates that a taxon’s immune strategy can influence how the immune system is affected by age."},{"title":"Differences in contractile behaviour between the soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscles during human walking","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/909","abstract":"The functional roles of individual lower limb muscles during human walking may differ depending on walking speed or duration. In this study, 11 volunteers walked on a treadmill for 60 min at speeds corresponding to both optimal and 20% above optimal energetic cost of transport whilst oxygen consumption and medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus fascicle lengths were measured. Although energetic cost of transport was ∼12% higher at the faster speed, it remained constant over 60 min at both speeds, suggesting that humans can walk for prolonged periods at a range of speeds without compromising energetic efficiency. The fascicles of both muscles exhibited rather ‘isometric’ behaviour during the early to mid stance phase of walking, which appears to be independent of walking speed or movement efficiency. However, several functional differences were observed between muscles. MG exhibited time- and speed-dependent decreases in operating length, and shortened faster during the pushoff phase at the faster walking speed. Conversely, soleus exhibited consistent contractile behaviour regardless of walking speed or duration, and always shortened slower than MG during pushoff. Soleus appears to play a more important functional role than MG during walking. This may be especially true when walking for prolonged periods or at speeds above the most energetically efficient, where the force potential and thus the functional importance of MG appears to decline."},{"title":"Increased aggression during pregnancy comes at a higher metabolic cost","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/5/771","abstract":"Aggressive behaviour is linked to fitness, but it is metabolically costly. Changes in metabolic demand during the reproductive cycle could constrain activity and thereby modulate behavioural phenotypes. We predicted that increased metabolic demands in late pregnancy would lead to reduced aggression and a lower metabolic cost of behaviour in the mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki. Contrary to our prediction, females became more aggressive in late pregnancy, but metabolic scope (i.e. the metabolic energy available for activity and behaviour) decreased. Consequently, late-stage pregnant females spent significantly more of their available metabolic scope on aggressive behaviour. Hence, as pregnancy progressed, females showed increasingly risky behaviour by depleting metabolic resources available for activities other than fighting. We argue that the metabolic cost of behaviour, and possibly personality, is best expressed with reference to metabolic scope, rather than resting metabolic rates or concentrations of metabolites. This dependence on metabolic scope could render reproductive success sensitive to environmental changes."},{"title":"Collision-avoidance behaviors of minimally restrained flying locusts to looming stimuli","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/4/641","abstract":"Visually guided collision avoidance is of paramount importance in flight, for instance to allow escape from potential predators. Yet, little is known about the types of collision-avoidance behaviors that may be generated by flying animals in response to an impending visual threat. We studied the behavior of minimally restrained locusts flying in a wind tunnel as they were subjected to looming stimuli presented to the side of the animal, simulating the approach of an object on a collision course. Using high-speed movie recordings, we observed a wide variety of collision-avoidance behaviors including climbs and dives away from – but also towards – the stimulus. In a more restrained setting, we were able to relate kinematic parameters of the flapping wings with yaw changes in the trajectory of the animal. Asymmetric wing flapping was most strongly correlated with changes in yaw, but we also observed a substantial effect of wing deformations. Additionally, the effect of wing deformations on yaw was relatively independent of that of wing asymmetries. Thus, flying locusts exhibit a rich range of collision-avoidance behaviors that depend on several distinct aerodynamic characteristics of wing flapping flight."},{"title":"Intracapsular algae provide fixed carbon to developing embryos of the salamander Ambystoma maculatum","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/452","abstract":"Each spring, North American spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) females each lay hundreds of eggs in shallow pools of water. Eggs are surrounded by jelly layers and are deposited as large gelatinous masses. Following deposition, masses are penetrated by a mutualistic green alga, Oophila amblystomatis, which enters individual egg capsules, proliferates and aggregates near the salamander embryo, providing oxygen that enhances development. We examined the effects of population density of intracapsular O. amblystomatis on A. maculatum embryos and show that larger algal populations promote faster embryonic growth and development. Also, we show that carbon fixed by O. amblystomatis is transferred to the embryos, providing the first evidence of direct translocation of photosynthate from a symbiont to a vertebrate host."},{"title":"Tracking bed bugs (Cimex lectularius): a study of the effect of physiological and extrinsic factors on the response to bed bug-derived volatiles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/460","abstract":"The common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, feeds on the blood of mammal and bird hosts, and is a pest of global importance. Semiochemicals are chemicals involved in animal communication that may affect behaviour and/or physiology. Attractive semiochemicals that play a role in mediating bed bug behaviour could be exploited for the development of a highly effective novel monitoring device. Tracking software was used to record the response of bed bugs to volatiles from paper previously exposed to conspecific bugs in a still-air olfactometer illuminated by infrared lights, through a variety of activity variables. The effect of time of day as an extrinsic factor, and sex, stage, mating status and nutritional status as physiological factors on the response of bed bugs to the volatiles was examined. Bed bugs of both sexes and all stages responded to the volatiles from bed bug-exposed papers, showing significant attraction and orientation towards the volatile source whether they were starved or engorged. Confirmation that the physiological factors examined do not affect the response of bed bugs to the volatiles from bed bug-exposed papers provides evidence that these bed bug-derived volatiles contain aggregation cues, as semiochemicals that promote aggregation should by definition be detected by both sexes and all life stages. A device baited with such semiochemicals could play a major role in limiting the impact of the current bed bug resurgence by enabling timely detection of infestations, along with quantitative evaluation of control and effective surveillance of the geographical distribution of the pest species."},{"title":"Adaptation to different salinities exposes functional specialization in the intestine of the sea bream (Sparus aurata L.)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/470","abstract":"The processing of intestinal fluid, in addition to a high drinking rate, is essential for osmoregulation in marine fish. This study analyzed the long-term response of the sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) to relevant changes of external salinity (12, 35 and 55 p.p.t.), focusing on the anterior intestine and in the less-often studied rectum. Intestinal water absorption, epithelial HCO3− secretion and gene expression of the main molecular mechanisms (SLC26a6, SLC26a3, SLC4a4, atp6v1b, CFTR, NKCC1 and NKCC2) involved in Cl− and HCO3− movements were examined. The anion transporters SLC26a6 and SLC26a3 are expressed severalfold higher in the anterior intestine, while the expression of Atp6v1b (V-type H+-ATPase β-subunit) is severalfold higher in the rectum. Prolonged exposure to altered external salinity was without effect on water absorption but was associated with concomitant changes in intestinal fluid content, epithelial HCO3− secretion and salinity-dependent expression of SLC26a6, SLC26a3 and SLC4a4 in the anterior intestine. However, the most striking response to external salinity was obtained in the rectum, where a 4- to 5-fold increase in water absorption was paralleled by a 2- to 3-fold increase in HCO3− secretion in response to a salinity of 55 p.p.t. In addition, the rectum of high salinity-acclimated fish shows a sustained (and enhanced) secretory current (Isc), identified in vitro in Ussing chambers and confirmed by the higher expression of CFTR and NKCC1 and by immunohistochemical protein localization. Taken together, the present results suggest a functional anterior–posterior specialization with regard to intestinal fluid processing and subsequently to salinity adaptation of the sea bream. The rectum becomes more active at higher salinities and functions as the final controller of intestinal function in osmoregulation."},{"title":"Shock avoidance by discrimination learning in the shore crab (Carcinus maenas) is consistent with a key criterion for pain","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/353","abstract":"Nociception allows for immediate reflex withdrawal whereas pain allows for longer-term protection via rapid learning. We examine here whether shore crabs placed within a brightly lit chamber learn to avoid one of two dark shelters when that shelter consistently results in shock. Crabs were randomly selected to receive shock or not prior to making their first choice and were tested again over 10 trials. Those that received shock in trial 2, irrespective of shock in trial 1, were more likely to switch shelter choice in the next trial and thus showed rapid discrimination. During trial 1, many crabs emerged from the shock shelter and an increasing proportion emerged in later trials, thus avoiding shock by entering a normally avoided light area. In a final test we switched distinctive visual stimuli positioned above each shelter and/or changed the orientation of the crab when placed in the chamber for the test. The visual stimuli had no effect on choice, but crabs with altered orientation now selected the shock shelter, indicating that they had discriminated between the two shelters on the basis of movement direction. These data, and those of other recent experiments, are consistent with key criteria for pain experience and are broadly similar to those from vertebrate studies."},{"title":"Ventilation rates and activity levels of juvenile jumbo squid under metabolic suppression in the oxygen minimum zone","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/359","abstract":"The Humboldt (jumbo) squid, Dosidicus gigas, is a part-time resident of the permanent oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific and, thereby, it encounters oxygen levels below its critical oxygen partial pressure. To better understand the ventilatory mechanisms that accompany the process of metabolic suppression in these top oceanic predators, we exposed juvenile D. gigas to the oxygen levels found in the OMZ (1% O2, 1 kPa, 10°C) and measured metabolic rate, activity cycling patterns, swimming mode, escape jet (burst) frequency, mantle contraction frequency and strength, stroke volume and oxygen extraction efficiency. In normoxia, metabolic rate varied between 14 and 29 μmol O2 g−1 wet mass h−1, depending on the level of activity. The mantle contraction frequency and strength were linearly correlated and increased significantly with activity level. Additionally, an increase in stroke volume and ventilatory volume per minute was observed, followed by a mantle hyperinflation process during high activity periods. Squid metabolic rate dropped more than 75% during exposure to hypoxia. Maximum metabolic rate was not achieved under such conditions and the metabolic scope was significantly decreased. Hypoxia changed the relationship between mantle contraction strength and frequency from linear to polynomial with increasing activity, indicating that, under hypoxic conditions, the jumbo squid primarily increases the strength of mantle contraction and does not regulate its frequency. Under hypoxia, jumbo squid also showed a larger inflation period (reduced contraction frequency) and decreased relaxed mantle diameter (shortened diffusion pathway), which optimize oxygen extraction efficiency (up to 82%/34%, without/with consideration of 60% potential skin respiration). Additionally, they breathe ‘deeply’, with more powerful contractions and enhanced stroke volume. This deep-breathing behavior allows them to display a stable ventilatory volume per minute, and explains the maintenance of the squid's cycling activity under such O2 conditions. During hypoxia, the respiratory cycles were shorter in length but increased in frequency. This was accompanied by an increase in the number of escape jets during active periods and a faster switch between swimming modes. In late hypoxia (onset ~170±10 min), all the ventilatory processes were significantly reduced and followed by a lethargic state, a behavior that seems closely associated with the process of metabolic suppression and enables the squid to extend its residence time in the OMZ."},{"title":"Spatial accuracy of a rapid defense behavior in caterpillars","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/379","abstract":"Aimed movements require that an animal accurately locates the target and correctly reaches that location. One such behavior is the defensive strike seen in Manduca sexta larva. These caterpillars respond to noxious mechanical stimuli applied to their abdomen with a strike of the mandibles towards the location of the stimulus. The accuracy with which the first strike movement reaches the stimulus site depends on the location of the stimulus. Reponses to dorsal stimuli are less accurate than those to ventral stimuli and the mandibles generally land ventral to the stimulus site. Responses to stimuli applied to anterior abdominal segments are less accurate than responses to stimuli applied to more posterior segments and the mandibles generally land posterior to the stimulus site. A trade-off between duration of the strike and radial accuracy is only seen in the anterior stimulus location (body segment A4). The lower accuracy of the responses to anterior and dorsal stimuli can be explained by the morphology of the animal; to reach these areas the caterpillar needs to move its body into a tight curve. Nevertheless, the accuracy is not exact in locations that the animal has shown it can reach, which suggests that consistently aiming more ventral and posterior of the stimulation site might be a defense strategy."},{"title":"Low-O2 acclimation shifts the hypoxia avoidance behaviour of snapper (Pagrus auratus) with only subtle changes in aerobic and anaerobic function","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/369","abstract":"It was hypothesised that chronic hypoxia acclimation (preconditioning) would alter the behavioural low-O2 avoidance strategy of fish as a result of both aerobic and anaerobic physiological adaptations. Avoidance and physiological responses of juvenile snapper (Pagrus auratus) were therefore investigated following a 6 week period of moderate hypoxia exposure (10.2–12.1 kPa PO2, 21±1°C) and compared with those of normoxic controls (PO2=20–21 kPa, 21±1°C). The critical oxygen pressure (Pcrit) limit of both groups was unchanged at ~7 kPa, as were standard, routine and maximum metabolic rates. However, hypoxia-acclimated fish showed increased tolerances to hypoxia in behavioural choice chambers by avoiding lower PO2 levels (3.3±0.7 vs 5.3±1.1 kPa) without displaying greater perturbations of lactate or glucose. This behavioural change was associated with unexpected physiological adjustments. For example, a decrease in blood O2 carrying capacity was observed after hypoxia acclimation. Also unexpected was an increase in whole-blood P50 following acclimation to low O2, perhaps facilitating Hb–O2 off-loading to tissues. In addition, cardiac mitochondria measured in situ using permeabilised fibres showed improved O2 uptake efficiencies. The proportion of the anaerobic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, at least relative to the aerobic marker enzyme citrate synthase, also increased in heart and skeletal red muscle, indicating enhanced anaerobic potential, or in situ lactate metabolism, in these tissues. Overall, these data suggest that a prioritization of O2 delivery and O2 utilisation over O2 uptake during long-term hypoxia may convey a significant survival benefit to snapper in terms of behavioural low-O2 tolerance."},{"title":"Zebrafish larvae evade predators by sensing water flow","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/388","abstract":"The ability of fish to evade predators is central to the ecology and evolution of a diversity of species. However, it is largely unclear how prey fish detect predators in order to initiate their escape. We tested whether larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) sense the flow created by adult predators of the same species. When placed together in a cylindrical arena, we found that larvae were able to escape 70% of predator strikes (mean escape probability Pescape=0.7, N=13). However, when we pharmacologically ablated the flow-sensitive lateral line system, larvae were rarely capable of escape (mean Pescape=0.05, N=11). In order to explore the rapid events that facilitate a successful escape, we recorded freely swimming predators and prey using a custom-built camera dolly. This device permitted two-dimensional camera motion to manually track prey and record their escape response with high temporal and spatial resolution. These recordings demonstrated that prey were more than 3 times more likely to evade a suction-feeding predator if they responded before (Pescape=0.53, N=43), rather than after (Pescape=0.15, N=13), a predator's mouth opened, which is a highly significant difference. Therefore, flow sensing plays an essential role in predator evasion by facilitating a response prior to a predator's strike."},{"title":"Contribution of larval nutrition to adult reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/399","abstract":"Within the complex life cycle of holometabolous insects, nutritional resources acquired during larval feeding are utilized by the pupa and the adult. The broad features of the transfer of larval resources to the pupae and the allocation of larval resources in the adult have been described by studies measuring and tracking macronutrients at different developmental stages. However, the mechanisms of resource transfer from the larva and the factors regulating the allocation of these resources in the adult between growth, reproduction and somatic maintenance are unknown. Drosophila melanogaster presents a tractable system in which to test cellular and tissue mechanisms of resource acquisition and allocation because of the detailed understanding of D. melanogaster development and the experimental tools to manipulate its tissues across developmental stages. In previous work, we demonstrated that the fat body of D. melanogaster larvae is important for survival of starvation stress in the young adult, and suggested that programmed cell death of the larval fat cells in the adult is important for allocation of resources for female reproduction. Here, we describe the temporal uptake of larval-derived carbon by the ovaries, and demonstrate the importance of larval fat-cell death in the maturation of the ovary and in fecundity. Larvae and adults were fed stable carbon isotopes to follow the acquisition of larval-derived carbon by the adult ovaries. We determined that over half of the nutrients acquired by the ovaries in 2-day-old adult females are dependent upon the death of the fat cells. Furthermore, when programmed cell death is inhibited in the larval fat cells, ovarian development was depressed and fecundity was reduced."},{"title":"Mechanics of snout expansion in suction-feeding seahorses: musculoskeletal force transmission","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/407","abstract":"Seahorses and other syngnathid fishes rely on a widening of the snout to create the buccal volume increase needed to suck prey into the mouth. This snout widening is caused by abduction of the suspensoria, the long and flat bones outlining the lateral sides of the mouth cavity. However, it remains unknown how seahorses can generate a forceful abduction of the suspensoria. To understand how force is transmitted to the suspensoria via the hyoid and the lower jaw, we performed mathematical simulations with models based on computerized tomography scans of Hippocampus reidi. Our results show that the hinge joint between the left and right hyoid bars, as observed in H. reidi, allows for an efficient force transmission to the suspensorium from a wide range of hyoid angles, including the extremely retracted hyoid orientations observed in vivo for syngnathids. Apart from the hyoid retraction force by the sternohyoideus–hypaxial muscles, force generated in the opposite direction on the hyoid by the mandibulohyoid ligament also has an important contribution to suspensorium abduction torque. Forces on the lower jaw contribute only approximately 10% of the total suspensorium torque. In particular, when dynamical aspects of hyoid retraction are included in the model, a steep increase is shown in suspensorium abduction torque at highly retracted hyoid positions, when the linkages to the lower jaw counteract further hyoid rotation in the sagittal plane. A delayed strain in these linkages allows syngnathids to postpone suction generation until the end of cranial rotation, a fundamental difference from non-syngnathiform fishes."},{"title":"Context-dependent correlation between resting metabolic rate and daily energy expenditure in wild chipmunks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/418","abstract":"Several empirical studies have shown that variation in daily energy expenditure (DEE) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) is influenced by environmental and individual factors, but whether these shared influences are responsible for, or independent of, relationships between DEE and RMR remains unknown. The objectives of this study were to (i) simultaneously evaluate the effects of environmental and individual variables on DEE and RMR in free-ranging eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) and (ii) quantify the correlation between DEE and RMR before and after controlling for common sources of variation. We found that the influence of individual factors on DEE and RMR is most often shared, whereas the influence of environmental factors tends to be distinct. Both raw and mass-adjusted DEE and RMR were significantly correlated, but this correlation vanished after accounting for the shared effect of reproduction on both traits. However, within reproductive individuals, DEE and RMR remained positively correlated after accounting for all other significant covariates. The ratio of DEE to RMR was significantly higher during reproduction than at other times of the year and was negatively correlated with ambient temperature. DEE and RMR appear to be inherently correlated during reproduction, but this correlation does not persist during other, less energy-demanding periods of the annual cycle."},{"title":"miR-203b: a novel regulator of MyoD expression in tilapia skeletal muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/447","abstract":"MyoD is one of the helix-loop-helix proteins regulating muscle-specific gene expression in tilapia. Tight regulation of the MyoD protein level is necessary for the precise regulation of skeletal muscle development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of regulatory RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. An increasing amount of evidence has suggested that miRNAs play an important role in regulating skeletal muscle development. We reasoned that MyoD expression may be regulated by miRNAs. Predictions from bioinformatics have identified a putative miR-203b target site in the 3′-UTR of the MyoD gene. Interestingly, miR-203b expression is negatively correlated with MyoD expression, whereas miR-203b suppression leads to a significant increase in MyoD expression, thereby activating MyoD downstream genes. A 3′-UTR luciferase reporter assay further verifies the direct interaction between miR-203b and MyoD. Taken together, our results reveal a novel molecular mechanism in which miRNA participates in transcriptional circuits that regulate gene expression in tilapia skeletal muscle."},{"title":"Glucose uptake and metabolism by red blood cells from fish with different extracellular glucose levels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/437","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to assess whether mechanisms of glucose trafficking by red blood cells (RBCs) relate to species-specific extracellular glucose levels. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus) and short-horned sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) had plasma glucose levels of 4, 4.1, 1.95 and 0.73 mmol l−1, respectively. Glucose uptake by isolated RBCs was measured by the initial incorporation of [6-14C]-glucose and steady-state glucose metabolism was determined by the production of 3H2O from [2-3H]-glucose. Saturation kinetics of glucose uptake and inhibition of both glucose uptake and metabolism by cytochalasin B and phloretin revealed that Atlantic cod, cunner and sculpin RBCs all had a facilitated transport component to glucose trafficking. RBCs from Atlantic salmon showed a linear relationship between glucose uptake and extracellular glucose level, but exhibited clear inhibition of glucose metabolism by cytochalasin B and phloretin, suggesting a component of facilitated glucose transport that is more elusive to detect. The production of 3H2O was linear for at least 6 h and as such presents a rigorous approach to measuring glycolytic rate. Steady-state rates of glucose metabolism were achieved at extracellular levels of approximately 1 mmol l−1 glucose for RBCs from all species, showing that within-species normal extracellular glucose level is not a primary determinant of the basal level of glycolysis. At physiological levels of extracellular glucose, the ratio of initial glucose uptake to glucose metabolism was 1.5 to 4 for all RBCs, suggesting that there is scope to increase metabolic rate without alteration of the basal glucose uptake capacity."},{"title":"Minke whales maximise energy storage on their feeding grounds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/427","abstract":"Seasonal trends in energy storage of the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), a capital breeder, were investigated in Iceland, a North Atlantic feeding ground. The aim was to better understand the energy acquisition strategies of minke whales and the energetic costs that different reproductive classes face during the breeding season. We modelled total blubber volume, using blubber thickness and morphometric measurements of individual whales. Blubber volume was influenced by body length, and was higher for pregnant females than mature whales. Blubber volume increased linearly through the feeding season at the same rate for mature (mean ± s.e.m.=0.0028±0.00103 m3 day−1; N=61 male, 5 female) and pregnant whales (0.0024±0.00100 m3 day−1; N=49), suggesting that minke whales aim to maximise energy storage while on the feeding grounds. The total amount of blubber accumulated over the feeding season (0.51±0.119 m3 for mature and 0.43±0.112 m3 for pregnant whales), together with energy stored as muscle and intra-abdominal fats, constitutes the total amount of energy available for reproduction (fetus development and lactation) on the breeding grounds, as well as migration, daily field metabolic rates, growth and body maintenance. No seasonal variation was observed for immature whales (N=4 male, 12 female), suggesting that they are investing most of their excess energy into growth rather than reproduction, in order to reach the length of sexual maturity faster and start reproducing earlier. Our novel modelling approach provides insight into large whale bioenergetics and life history strategies, as well as the relationship between single-site measurement of blubber thickness and total blubber volume."},{"title":"Pharmacological assays reveal age-related changes in synaptic transmission at the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junction that are modified by reduced insulin signalling","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/492","abstract":"Frailty is a feature of neuromuscular ageing. Here we provide insight into the relative contribution of pre- and postsynaptic dysfunction to neuromuscular ageing using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Assays of C. elegans motility highlight a precipitous decline during ageing. We describe a novel deployment of pharmacological assays of C. elegans neuromuscular function to resolve pre- and postsynaptic dysfunction that underpin this decreased motility during ageing. The cholinergic agonist levamisole and the cholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb elicited whole worm contraction and allowed a direct comparison of neuromuscular integrity, from 1 to 16 days old: measurements could be made from aged worms that were otherwise almost completely immobile. The rapidity and magnitude of the drug-induced contraction provides a measure of neuromuscular signalling whilst the difference between levamisole and aldicarb highlights presynaptic effects. Presynaptic neuromuscular transmission increased between 1 and 5 days old in wild-type but not in the insulin/IGF1 receptor mutant daf-2 (e1370). Intriguingly, there was no evidence of a role for insulin-dependent effects in older worms. Notably in 16-day-old worms, which were virtually devoid of spontaneous movement, the maximal contraction produced by both drugs was unchanged. Taken together the data support a maturation of presynaptic function and/or upstream elements during early ageing that is lost after genetic reduction of insulin signalling. Furthermore, this experimental approach has demonstrated a counterintuitive phenomenon: in aged worms neuromuscular strength is maintained despite the absence of motility."},{"title":"Behavior and survival of Mytilus congeners following episodes of elevated body temperature in air and seawater","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/502","abstract":"Coping with environmental stress may involve combinations of behavioral and physiological responses. We examined potential interactions between adult mussels' simple behavioral repertoire – opening/closing of the shell valves – and thermal stress physiology in common-gardened individuals of three Mytilus congeners found on the West Coast of North America: two native species (M. californianus and M. trossulus) and one invasive species from the Mediterranean (M. galloprovincialis). We first continuously monitored valve behavior over three consecutive days on which body temperatures were gradually increased, either in air or in seawater. A temperature threshold effect was evident between 25 and 33°C in several behavioral measures. Mussels tended to spend much less time with the valves in a sealed position following exposure to 33°C body temperature, especially when exposed in air. This behavior could not be explained by decreases in adductor muscle glycogen (stores of this metabolic fuel actually increased in some scenarios), impacts of forced valve sealing on long-term survival (none observed in a second experiment), or loss of contractile function in the adductor muscles (individuals exhibited as many or more valve adduction movements following elevated body temperature compared with controls). We hypothesize that this reduced propensity to seal the valves following thermal extremes represents avoidance of hypoxia–reoxygenation cycles and concomitant oxidative stress. We further conjecture that prolonged valve gaping following episodes of elevated body temperature may have important ecological consequences by affecting species interactions. We then examined survival over a 90 day period following exposure to elevated body temperature and/or emersion, observing ongoing mortality throughout this monitoring period. Survival varied significantly among species (M. trossulus had the lowest survival) and among experimental contexts (survival was lowest after experiencing elevated body temperature in seawater). Surprisingly, we observed no cumulative impact on survival of 3 days relative to 1 day of exposure to elevated body temperature. The delayed mortality and context-specific outcomes we observed have important implications for the design of future experiments and for interpretation of field distribution patterns of these species. Ultimately, variation in the catalog of physiological and behavioral capacities among closely related or sympatric species is likely to complicate prediction of the ecological consequences of global change and species invasions."},{"title":"Mice selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running have larger midbrains: support for the mosaic model of brain evolution","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/515","abstract":"Increased brain size, relative to body mass, is a primary characteristic distinguishing the mammalian lineage. This greater encephalization has come with increased behavioral complexity and, accordingly, it has been suggested that selection on behavioral traits has been a significant factor leading to the evolution of larger whole-brain mass. In addition, brains may evolve in a mosaic fashion, with functional components having some freedom to evolve independently from other components, irrespective of, or in addition to, changes in size of the whole brain. We tested whether long-term selective breeding for high voluntary wheel running in laboratory house mice results in changes in brain size, and whether those changes have occurred in a concerted or mosaic fashion. We measured wet and dry brain mass via dissections and brain volume with ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging of brains that distinguished the caudate-putamen, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum and forebrain. Adjusting for body mass as a covariate, mice from the four replicate high-runner (HR) lines had statistically larger non-cerebellar wet and dry brain masses than those from four non-selected control lines, with no differences in cerebellum wet or dry mass or volume. Moreover, the midbrain volume in HR mice was ~13% larger (P<0.05), while volumes of the caudate-putamen, hippocampus, cerebellum and forebrain did not differ statistically between HR and control lines. We hypothesize that the enlarged midbrain of HR mice is related to altered neurophysiological function in their dopaminergic system. To our knowledge, this is the first example in which selection for a particular mammalian behavior has been shown to result in a change in size of a specific brain region."},{"title":"Lobula-specific visual projection neurons are involved in perception of motion-defined second-order motion in Drosophila","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/524","abstract":"A wide variety of animal species including humans and fruit flies see second-order motion although they lack coherent spatiotemporal correlations in luminance. Recent electrophysiological recordings, together with intensive psychophysical studies, are bringing to light the neural underpinnings of second-order motion perception in mammals. However, where and how the higher-order motion signals are processed in the fly brain is poorly understood. Using the rich genetic tools available in Drosophila and examining optomotor responses in fruit flies to several stimuli, we revealed that two lobula-specific visual projection neurons, specifically connecting the lobula and the central brain, are involved in the perception of motion-defined second-order motion, independent of whether the second-order feature is moving perpendicular or opposite to the local first-order motion. By contrast, blocking these neurons has no effect on first-order and flicker-defined second-order stimuli in terms of response delay. Our results suggest that visual neuropils deep in the optic lobe and the central brain, whose functional roles in motion processing were previously unclear, may be specifically required for motion-defined motion processing."},{"title":"Ant foraging on complex trails: route learning and the role of trail pheromones in Lasius niger","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/188","abstract":"Ants are central place foragers and use multiple information sources to navigate between the nest and feeding sites. Individual ants rapidly learn a route, and often prioritize memory over pheromone trails when tested on a simple trail with a single bifurcation. However, in nature, ants often forage at locations that are reached via more complex routes with multiple trail bifurcations. Such routes may be more difficult to learn, and thus ants would benefit from additional information. We hypothesized that trail pheromones play a more significant role in ant foraging on complex routes, either by assisting in navigation or route learning or both. We studied Lasius niger workers foraging on a doubly bifurcating trail with four end points. Route learning was slower and errors greater on alternating (e.g. left–right) versus repeating routes (e.g. left–left), with error rates of 32 and 3%, respectively. However, errors on alternating routes decreased by 30% when trail pheromone was present. Trail pheromones also aid route learning, leading to reduced errors in subsequent journeys without pheromone. If an experienced forager makes an error when returning to a food source, it reacts by increasing pheromone deposition on the return journey. In addition, high levels of trail pheromone suppress further pheromone deposition. This negative feedback mechanism may act to conserve pheromone or to regulate recruitment. Taken together, these results demonstrate further complexity and sophistication in the foraging system of ant colonies, especially in the role of trail pheromones and their relationship with learning and the use of private information (memory) in a complex environment."},{"title":"Inter-leg coordination in the control of walking speed in Drosophila","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/3/480","abstract":"Legged locomotion is the most common behavior of terrestrial animals and it is assumed to have become highly optimized during evolution. Quadrupeds, for instance, use distinct gaits that are optimal with regard to metabolic cost and have characteristic kinematic features and patterns of inter-leg coordination. In insects, the situation is not as clear. In general, insects are able to alter inter-leg coordination systematically with locomotion speed, producing a continuum of movement patterns. This notion, however, is based on the study of several insect species, which differ greatly in size and mass. Each of these species tends to walk at a rather narrow range of speeds. We have addressed these issues by examining four strains of Drosophila, which are similar in size and mass, but tend to walk at different speed ranges. Our data suggest that Drosophila controls its walking speed almost exclusively via step frequency. At high walking speeds, we invariably found tripod coordination patterns, the quality of which increased with speed as indicated by a simple measure of tripod coordination strength (TCS). At low speeds, we also observed tetrapod coordination and wave gait-like walking patterns. These findings not only suggest a systematic speed dependence of inter-leg movement patterns but also imply that inter-leg coordination is flexible. This was further supported by amputation experiments in which we examined walking behavior in animals after the removal of a hindleg. These animals show immediate adaptations in body posture, leg kinematics and inter-leg coordination, thereby maintaining their ability to walk."},{"title":"Analysis of the transitional flow field over a fixed hummingbird wing","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/303","abstract":"We analyzed the flow fields characterized by chord-based Reynolds numbers of 5000 to 15,000 over a stationary model of a hummingbird (Calypte anna) wing. Utilizing two experimental techniques, constant-temperature anemometry and stereo particle image velocimetry, the high-fidelity results depict a laminar-to-turbulent transition process that develops over the wing. At both zero and non-zero angles of attack the spectrum of the velocity signals is wide. At non-zero angles of attack the flow separates from the wing surface and a shear layer forms. As a result, unsteady flow disturbances amplify at a chord-based Reynolds numbers as low as 5000. Nevertheless, only at a Reynolds number of 15,000 is the flow disturbance growth rate sufficient to bring enough momentum from the outer region of the boundary layer to reattach the flow to the wing surface. For a Reynolds number of 5000, a comparison between the observed growth rates and a theoretical approximation concludes that flow disturbances of a Strouhal number of unity (and above) are no longer two-dimensional. In view of these conclusions, this study could serve as the first step towards a better understanding of the flow mechanisms over steady revolving and periodically flapping wings at this Reynolds number regime."},{"title":"Using the American alligator and a repeated-measures design to place constraints on in vivo shoulder joint range of motion in dinosaurs and other fossil archosaurs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/275","abstract":"Using the extant phylogenetic bracket of dinosaurs (crocodylians and birds), recent work has reported that elbow joint range of motion (ROM) studies of fossil dinosaur forearms may be providing conservative underestimates of fully fleshed in vivo ROM. As humeral ROM occupies a more central role in forelimb movements, the placement of quantitative constraints on shoulder joint ROM could improve fossil reconstructions. Here, we investigated whether soft tissues affect the more mobile shoulder joint in the same manner in which they affect elbow joint ROM in an extant archosaur. This test involved separately and repeatedly measuring humeral ROM in Alligator mississippiensis as soft tissues were dissected away in stages to bare bone. Our data show that the ROMs of humeral flexion and extension, as well as abduction and adduction, both show a statistically significant increase as flesh is removed, but then decrease when the bones must be physically articulated and moved until they separate from one another and/or visible joint surfaces. A similar ROM pattern is inferred for humeral pronation and supination. All final skeletonized ROMs were less than initial fully fleshed ROMs. These results are consistent with previously reported elbow joint ROM patterns from the extant phylogenetic bracket of dinosaurs. Thus, studies that avoid separation of complementary articular surfaces may be providing fossil shoulder joint ROMs that underestimate in vivo ROM in dinosaurs, as well as other fossil archosaurs."},{"title":"Rapid decline of cold tolerance at young age is associated with expression of stress genes in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/253","abstract":"Many endogenous factors influence thermal tolerance of insects. Among these, age contributes an important source of variation. Heat tolerance is typically high in newly eclosed insects, before declining dramatically. It is not known whether this phenomenon relates to cold tolerance also. In addition, the underlying mechanisms of this variation are unresolved. In this study, we tested whether cold tolerance declines in Drosophila melanogaster females aged from 0 to 5 days. We also assessed whether expression (basal and induced) of eight stress genes (hsp22, hsp23, hsp40, hsp68, hsp70Aa, hsp83, Starvin and Frost) varied post-eclosion in correspondence with changes found in cold tolerance. We report that cold tolerance was very high at eclosion and then it rapidly declined in young flies. hsp23 and hsp68 showed a dramatic age-related variation of basal expression that was associated with cold tolerance proxies. Significant age-related plasticity of cold-induced expression was also found for hsp22, hsp23, hsp68, hsp70Aa, Frost and Starvin. Induced expression of hsp22 and hsp70Aa was high in newly enclosed phenotypes before declining dramatically, whilst opposite age-related patterns were found for hsp23, hsp68, Starvin and Frost. This study shows a marked within-stage variation in cold tolerance. The involvement of the stress genes in setting basal thermal tolerance is discussed."},{"title":"Gestation increases the energetic cost of breathing in the lizard Tiliqua rugosa","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/171","abstract":"High gestational loads result in fetuses that occupy a large proportion of the body cavity and may compress maternal organs. Compression of the lungs results in alterations in breathing patterns during gestation, which may affect the energetic cost of breathing. In this study, the energetic cost of breathing during gestation was determined in the viviparous skink Tiliqua rugosa. Radiographic imaging showed progressive lung compression during gestation and a 30% reduction in the lung inflation index (rib number at which the caudal margin of the lung was imaged divided by total rib number). Pneumotachography and open flow respirometry were used to measure breathing patterns and metabolic rates. Gestation induced a twofold increase in minute ventilation via increases in breathing frequency, but no change in inspired tidal volume. The rates of O2 consumption and CO2 production did not change significantly during gestation. Together, these results suggest that a relative hyperventilation occurs during gestation in T. rugosa, which in turn suggests that diffusion and/or perfusion limitations may exist at the lung during gestation. The energetic cost of breathing was estimated as a percentage of resting metabolic rate using hypercapnia to stimulate ventilation at different stages of pregnancy. The energetic cost of breathing in non-pregnant lizards was 19.96±3.85% of resting metabolic rate and increased threefold to 62.80±10.11% during late gestation. This significant increase in the energetic cost of breathing may have significant consequences for energy budgets during gestation."},{"title":"Social scent marks do not improve avoidance of parasites in foraging bumblebees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/285","abstract":"Foraging is a result of innate and acquired mechanisms, and is optimized in order to increase fitness. During foraging, an animal faces many threats, such as predation and infection. The uptake of parasites and diseases while foraging is common and an individual should be adapted to detect and avoid such threats, using cues from either the abiotic environment or the parasite. Social animals possess an additional cue to detect such contaminated food sources: information provided by conspecifics. Bumblebees avoid contaminated flowers, but the cues used by the bees to distinguish contamination remain unknown. Under controlled laboratory conditions, we tested the use of scent marks derived from other foragers in choosing between a contaminated (by Crithidia bombi) and an uncontaminated flower. As a positive control we tested the bee's choice between two flowers, one scented with geraniol and containing a highly rewarding sugar solution, and the other not scented and containing a poorer reward. The bees mainly chose the uncontaminated and the rewarding scented flowers. Scent marks did not increase the efficiency of the bumblebees in choosing the better flower. The bees from both experiments behaved similarly, showing that the main and most relevant cue used to choose the uncontaminated flower is the odour from the parasite itself. The adaptation of bumblebees to avoid flowers contaminated by C. bombi arose from the long-term host–parasite interaction between these species. This strong adaptation results in an innate behaviour of bees and a detection and aversion of the odour of contaminated flower nectar."},{"title":"Human IGF1 extends lifespan and enhances resistance to Plasmodium falciparum infection in the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/208","abstract":"The highly conserved insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling (IIS) pathway regulates metabolism, development, lifespan and immunity across a wide range of organisms. Previous studies have shown that human insulin ingested in the blood meal can activate mosquito IIS, resulting in attenuated lifespan and increased malaria parasite infection. Because human IGF1 is present at higher concentrations in blood than insulin and is functionally linked with lifespan and immune processes, we predicted that human IGF1 ingested in a blood meal would affect lifespan and malaria parasite infection in the mosquito Anopheles stephensi. Here we demonstrate that physiological levels of ingested IGF1, like insulin, can persist intact in the blood-filled midgut for up to 30 h and disseminate into the mosquito body, and that both peptides activate IIS in mosquito cells and midgut. At these same levels, ingested IGF1 alone extended average mosquito lifespan by 23% compared with controls and, more significantly, when ingested in infected blood meals, reduced the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquitoes by >20% and parasite load by 35–50% compared with controls. Thus, the effects of ingested IGF1 on mosquito lifespan and immunity are opposite to those of ingested insulin. These results offer the first evidence that insect cells can functionally discriminate between mammalian insulin and IGF1. Further, in light of previous success in genetically targeting IIS to alter mosquito lifespan and malaria parasite transmission, this study indicates that a more complete understanding of the IIS-activating ligands in blood can be used to optimize transgenic strategies for malaria control."},{"title":"Ovarian developmental variation in the primitively eusocial wasp Ropalidia marginata suggests a gateway to worker ontogeny and the evolution of sociality","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/181","abstract":"Social insects are characterized by reproductive caste differentiation of colony members into one or a small number of fertile queens and a large number of sterile workers. The evolutionary origin and maintenance of such sterile workers remains an enduring puzzle in insect sociobiology. Here, we studied ovarian development in over 600 freshly eclosed, isolated, virgin female Ropalidia marginata wasps, maintained in the laboratory. The wasps differed greatly both in the time taken to develop their ovaries and in the magnitude of ovarian development despite having similar access to resources. All females started with no ovarian development at day zero, and the percentage of individuals with at least one oocyte at any stage of development increased gradually across age, reached 100% at 100 days and decreased slightly thereafter. Approximately 40% of the females failed to develop ovaries within the average ecological lifespan of the species. Age, body size and adult feeding rate, when considered together, were the most important factors governing ovarian development. We suggest that such flexibility and variation in the potential and timing of reproductive development may physiologically predispose females to accept worker roles and thus provide a gateway to worker ontogeny and the evolution of sociality."},{"title":"Real-time measurement of metabolic rate during freezing and thawing of the wood frog, Rana sylvatica: implications for overwinter energy use","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/292","abstract":"Ectotherms overwintering in temperate ecosystems must survive low temperatures while conserving energy to fuel post-winter reproduction. Freeze-tolerant wood frogs, Rana sylvatica, have an active response to the initiation of ice formation that includes mobilising glucose from glycogen and circulating it around the body to act as a cryoprotectant. We used flow-through respirometry to measure CO2 production (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/216/2/292/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>) in real time during cooling, freezing and thawing. CO2 production increases sharply at three points during freeze–thaw: at +1°C during cooling prior to ice formation (total of 104±17 μl CO2 frog−1 event−1), at the initiation of freezing (565±85 μl CO2 frog−1 freezing event−1) and after the frog has thawed (564±75 μ l CO2 frog−1 freezing event−1). We interpret these increases in metabolic rate to represent the energetic costs of preparation for freezing, the response to freezing and the re-establishment of homeostasis and repair of damage after thawing, respectively. We assumed that frogs metabolise lipid when unfrozen and that carbohydrate fuels metabolism during cooling, freezing and thawing, and when frozen. We then used microclimate temperature data to predict overwinter energetics of wood frogs. Based on the freezing and melting points we measured, frogs in the field were predicted to experience as many as 23 freeze–thaw cycles in the winter of our microclimate recordings. Overwinter carbohydrate consumption appears to be driven by the frequency of freeze–thaw events, and changes in overwinter climate that affect the frequency of freeze–thaw will influence carbohydrate consumption, but changes that affect mean temperatures and the frequency of winter warm spells will modify lipid consumption."},{"title":"Associative learning in the dengue vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti: avoidance of a previously attractive odor or surface color that is paired with an aversive stimulus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/218","abstract":"Associative learning has been shown in a variety of insects, including the mosquitoes Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae.

After training in which a dark surface alone or a dark surface with odor was paired with electric shock, mosquitoes avoided the previously attractive area. The association was stronger when odor was included in training, was retained for at least 60 min but not for 24 h, and was equal for males and females.

The ‘feature’ being manipulated is the presence of a single blue circle among three circles marking the location of a small sucrose reward. That is, a ‘feature-negative’ target had three white circles, while a ‘feature-positive’ target had two white circles and one blue one. Two experiments were performed. In both experiments, each bee was tested under two different reward scenarios (treatments). In the first experiment, during the feature-positive treatment bees received 4 μl of 2 mol l−1 sucrose when choosing the feature-positive plate, but received 4 μl of saturated NaCl solution (saltwater) when choosing the feature-negative plate. During the feature-negative treatment, bees were rewarded when visiting the feature-negative plate, while visitation to the feature-positive plate only offered bees the saltwater. The second experiment was a repeat of the first except that pure water was offered instead of saltwater in the non-rewarding feeding plate. As an experimental control, a set of bees was offered sequential trials where both the feature-positive and feature-negative plates offered the sucrose reward. Bee feeding plate choice differed between the feature-positive and feature-negative treatments in both experiments. Bees favored the feeding plate type with the sucrose reward in each treatment, and never consumed the saltwater or pure water when encountered in either treatment. Further, behavior of bees during both the feature-positive and feature-negative treatments differed from that of control bees. However, neither feature-positive nor feature-negative learning reached high levels of success. Further, a feature-positive effect was seen when pure water was offered; bees learned to solve the feature-positive problem more rapidly. When we tested bees using simply the choice of blue versus white targets, where one color held the sucrose reward and the other the saltwater, a bee's fidelity to the color offering the sucrose reward quickly reached very high levels."},{"title":"Factors shaping the ontogeny of vocal signals in a wild parrot","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/338","abstract":"Parrots rely heavily on vocal signals to maintain their social and mobile lifestyles. We studied vocal ontogeny in nests of wild green-rumped parrotlets (Forpus passerinus) in Venezuela. We identified three successive phases of vocal signaling that corresponded closely to three independently derived phases of physiological development. For each ontogenetic phase, we characterized the relative importance of anatomical constraints, motor skills necessary for responding to specific contexts of the immediate environment, and the learning of signals that are necessary for adult forms of communication. We observed shifts in the relative importance of these three factors as individuals progressed from one stage to the next; there was no single fixed ratio of factors that applied across the entire ontogenetic sequence. The earliest vocalizations were short in duration, as predicted from physical constraints and under-developed motor control. Calls became longer and frequency modulated during intermediate nestling ages in line with motor skills required for competitive begging. In the week before fledging, calls drastically shortened in accordance with the flight-constrained short durations of adult contact calls. The latter constraints were made evident by the demonstrated links between wing-assisted incline running, a widespread prelude to avian flight, just before the shift from long-duration begging calls to short-duration contact calls. At least in this species, the shifting emphases of factors at different ontogenetic stages precluded the morphing of intermediate-stage begging calls into adult contact calls; as shown previously, the latter are influenced by sample templates provided by parents."},{"title":"Apoptosis of Ascogregarina taiwanensis (Apicomplexa: Lecudinidae), which failed to migrate within its natural host","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/230","abstract":"Sexual reproduction of Ascogregarina taiwanensis (Apicomplexa: Lecudinidae), a parasite specific to the mosquito Aedes albopictus, in Malpighian tubules is initiated by the entry of the trophotozoites developed in the midgut shortly after pupation (usually <5 h). However, only a low proportion of trophozoites are able to migrate; others end up dying. In this study, we demonstrated that those trophozoites that failed to migrate eventually died of apoptosis. Morphological changes such as shrinkage, chromatin aggregations and formation of blunt ridges on the surface were seen in moribund trophozoites. In addition, DNA fragmentation of trophozoites isolated from the midgut of pupae was demonstrated by the presence of DNA ladders, Annexin V staining and TUNEL assays. Detection of caspase-like activity suggests that apoptosis of those trophozoites may have occurred through a mechanism of an intrinsic or mitochondrial-mediated pathway. Although apoptosis has been observed in various protozoan species, it is not clear how apoptosis in single-celled organisms might result from evolution by natural selection. However, we speculate that apoptosis may regulate the parasite load of A. taiwanensis within its natural mosquito host, leading to an optimized state of the survival rate for both parasite and host."},{"title":"Protein-induced mass increase of the gastrointestinal tract of locusts improves net nutrient uptake via larger meals rather than more efficient nutrient absorption","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/329","abstract":"Increasing the tissue biomass and/or volume of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is commonly seen when animals feed on poor-quality diets. This increase can simply permit larger meal sizes, but may also rebalance nutritionally imbalanced ingesta by allowing selective absorption of limiting nutrients. In an insect herbivore, the migratory locust, a synthetic diet with a high ratio of protein to carbohydrate was found to induce mass enhancement of the GIT. When normalised for sex and overall body size, increases to the mass of the foregut and midgut caeca resulted in higher absorption (20–30%) of both protein and carbohydrate when subsequently feeding on three chemically and structurally different grasses. Greater net absorption of macronutrients occurred because these locusts ate larger meals that transited at the same time and with the same digestive efficiency as locusts in which the GIT was not enlarged. Thus, plasticity of the GIT did not improve nutritional homeostasis, but increased the rate of nutrient uptake."},{"title":"Walking on smooth and rough ground: activity and timing of the claw retractor muscle in the beetle Pachnoda marginata peregrina (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/319","abstract":"The activity pattern of the claw retractor muscle of Pachnoda marginata peregrina beetles was examined in this study.

Electromyograms of the muscle revealed a rather similar activity pattern during beetle locomotion on rough and smooth substrates. We recorded units with small and large amplitude, with the smaller unit being active during almost the entire stance phase, and the larger unit active roughly in the first half of stance. Small but significant differences were found in the precise onset and end of activity. Both small and large units began their activity earlier on the rough surface. Although there was no difference at the end of activity in the small unit between surfaces, the large unit ended its activity significantly earlier on the rough substrate. The spike frequencies on both surfaces were also significantly different for small and large units. The small unit showed a higher spike frequency on the smooth surface, while the large unit had a higher spike frequency on the rough surface. From our experiments, we conclude that the muscle is controlled by the same basic activity pattern on different surfaces, with some adjustments that are due to sensory feedback. The adjustments cause differences in onset and end of activity, as well as in spike frequency of the involved muscle units."},{"title":"Intrinsic expression of transcortin in neural cells of the mouse brain: a histochemical and molecular study","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/245","abstract":"Corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG, transcortin) has been shown to be expressed in the brain of rat and human species. In this study, we examined the CBG brain expression and cDNA structure in mice, comparing wild-type (Cbg+/+) and Cbg knockout mice (Cbg−/−, obtained by genetic disruption of the SerpinA6 alias Cbg gene). We used double immunofluorescence labeling with specific neuronal and glial markers to analyze the cellular localization of CBG in various regions of the mouse brain. In wild-type (Cbg+/+) mice, we found CBG immunoreactivity in neuronal perikarya of the magnocellular hypothalamic nuclei, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and pituitary. A portion of glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) contained CBG immunoreactivity, including some of the ependymal cells and choroid plexus cells. No CBG immunoreactivity was detected in Cbg−/− brain tissues. Using RT-PCR, we showed that the full-length Cbg mRNA is present in those regions, indicating an intrinsic expression of the steroid-binding globulin. Furthermore, sequencing analysis showed that Cbg cDNA obtained from the mouse hypothalamus was homologous to Cbg cDNA obtained from the liver. Finally, we have evaluated the relative levels of CBG expression in various brain regions and in the liver by quantitative PCR. We found that brain levels of Cbg mRNA are low compared with the liver but significantly higher than in CBG-deficient mice. Although derived from the same gene as liver CBG, brain CBG protein may play a specific or complementary role that requires the production and analysis of brain-specific Cbg knockout models."},{"title":"Environmental interaction influences muscle activation strategy during sand-swimming in the sandfish lizard Scincus scincus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/260","abstract":"Animals like the sandfish lizard (Scincus scincus) that live in desert sand locomote on and within a granular medium whose resistance to intrusion is dominated by frictional forces. Recent kinematic studies revealed that the sandfish utilizes a wave of body undulation during swimming. Models predict that a particular combination of wave amplitude and wavelength yields maximum speed for a given frequency, and experiments have suggested that the sandfish targets this kinematic waveform. To investigate the neuromechanical strategy of the sandfish during walking, burial and swimming, here we use high-speed X-ray and visible light imaging with synchronized electromyogram (EMG) recordings of epaxial muscle activity. While moving on the surface, body undulation was not observed and EMG showed no muscle activation. During subsurface sand-swimming, EMG revealed an anterior-to-posterior traveling wave of muscle activation which traveled faster than the kinematic wave. Muscle activation intensity increased as the animal swam deeper into the material but was insensitive to undulation frequency. These findings were in accord with empirical force measurements, which showed that resistance force increased with depth but was independent of speed. The change in EMG intensity with depth indicates that the sandfish targets a kinematic waveform (a template) that models predict maximizes swimming speed and minimizes the mechanical cost of transport as the animal descends into granular media. The differences in the EMG pattern compared with EMG of undulatory swimmers in fluids can be attributed to the friction-dominated intrusion forces of granular media."},{"title":"Protective buttressing of the human fist and the evolution of hominin hands","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/236","abstract":"The derived proportions of the human hand may provide supportive buttressing that protects the hand from injury when striking with a fist. Flexion of digits 2–5 results in buttressing of the pads of the distal phalanges against the central palm and the palmar pads of the proximal phalanges. Additionally, adduction of the thenar eminence to abut the dorsal surface of the distal phalanges of digits 2 and 3 locks these digits into a solid configuration that may allow a transfer of energy through the thenar eminence to the wrist. To test the hypothesis of a performance advantage, we measured: (1) the forces and rate of change of acceleration (jerk) from maximum effort strikes of subjects striking with a fist and an open hand; (2) the static stiffness of the second metacarpo-phalangeal (MCP) joint in buttressed and unbuttressed fist postures; and (3) static force transfer from digits 2 and 3 to digit 1 also in buttressed and unbuttressed fist postures. We found that peak forces, force impulses and peak jerk did not differ between the closed fist and open palm strikes. However, the structure of the human fist provides buttressing that increases the stiffness of the second MCP joint by fourfold and, as a result of force transfer through the thenar eminence, more than doubles the ability of the proximal phalanges to transmit ‘punching’ force. Thus, the proportions of the human hand provide a performance advantage when striking with a fist. We propose that the derived proportions of hominin hands reflect, in part, sexual selection to improve fighting performance."},{"title":"Terrestrial locomotion imposes high metabolic requirements on bats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4340","abstract":"The evolution of powered flight involved major morphological changes in Chiroptera. Nevertheless, all bats are also capable of crawling on the ground and some are even skilled sprinters. We asked if a highly derived morphology adapted for flapping flight imposes high metabolic requirements on bats when moving on the ground. We measured the metabolic rate during terrestrial locomotion in mastiff bats, Molossus currentium, a species that is both a fast-flying aerial-hawking bat and an agile crawler on the ground. Metabolic rates of bats averaged 8.0±4.0 ml CO2 min–1 during a 1-min period of sprinting at 1.3±0.6 km h–1. With rising average speed, mean metabolic rates increased, reaching peak values that were similar to those of flying conspecifics. Metabolic rates of M. currentium were higher than those of similar-sized rodents that sprinted at similar velocities under steady-state conditions. When M. currentium sprinted at peak velocities, its aerobic metabolic rate was 3–5 times higher than those of rodent species running continuously in steady-state conditions. Costs of transport (J kg–1 m–1) were more than 10 times higher for running than for flying bats. We conclude that at the same speed bats experience higher metabolic rates during short sprints than quadruped mammals during steady-state terrestrial locomotion, yet running bats achieve higher maximal mass-specific aerobic metabolic rates than non-volant mammals such as rodents."},{"title":"Recruitment of faster motor units is associated with greater rates of fascicle strain and rapid changes in muscle force during locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/216/2/198","abstract":"Animals modulate the power output needed for different locomotor tasks by changing muscle forces and fascicle strain rates. To generate the necessary forces, appropriate motor units must be recruited. Faster motor units have faster activation–deactivation rates than slower motor units, and they contract at higher strain rates; therefore, recruitment of faster motor units may be advantageous for tasks that involve rapid movements or high rates of work. This study identified motor unit recruitment patterns in the gastrocnemii muscles of goats and examined whether faster motor units are recruited when locomotor speed is increased. The study also examined whether locomotor tasks that elicit faster (or slower) motor units are associated with increased (or decreased) in vivo tendon forces, force rise and relaxation rates, fascicle strains and/or strain rates. Electromyography (EMG), sonomicrometry and muscle-tendon force data were collected from the lateral and medial gastrocnemius muscles of goats during level walking, trotting and galloping and during inclined walking and trotting. EMG signals were analyzed using wavelet and principal component analyses to quantify changes in the EMG frequency spectra across the different locomotor conditions. Fascicle strain and strain rate were calculated from the sonomicrometric data, and force rise and relaxation rates were determined from the tendon force data. The results of this study showed that faster motor units were recruited as goats increased their locomotor speeds from level walking to galloping. Slow inclined walking elicited EMG intensities similar to those of fast level galloping but different EMG frequency spectra, indicating that recruitment of the different motor unit types depended, in part, on characteristics of the task. For the locomotor tasks and muscles analyzed here, recruitment patterns were generally associated with in vivo fascicle strain rates, EMG intensity and tendon force. Together, these data provide new evidence that changes in motor unit recruitment have an underlying mechanical basis, at least for certain locomotor tasks."},{"title":"Thermal effects on motor control and in vitro muscle dynamics of the ballistic tongue apparatus in chameleons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4345","abstract":"Temperature strongly affects whole-organism performance through its effect on muscle contractile rate properties, but movements powered by elastic recoil are liberated from much of the performance decline experienced by muscle-powered movements at low temperature. We examined the motor control and muscle contractile physiology underlying an elastically powered movement – tongue projection in chameleons – and the associated muscle powered retraction to test the premise that the thermal dependence of muscle contractile dynamics is conserved. We further tested the associated hypothesis that motor control patterns and muscle contractile dynamics must change as body temperature varies, despite the thermal robustness of tongue-projection performance. We found that, over 14–26°C, the latency between the onset of the tongue projector muscle activity and tongue projection was significantly affected by temperature (Q10 of 2.56), as were dynamic contractile properties of the tongue projector and retractor muscles (Q10 of 1.48–5.72), supporting our hypothesis that contractile rates slow with decreasing temperature and, as a result, activity durations of the projector muscle increase at low temperatures. Over 24–36°C, thermal effects on motor control and muscle contractile properties declined, indicating that temperature effects are more extreme across lower temperature ranges. Over the entire 14–36°C range, intensity of muscle activity for the tongue muscles was not affected by temperature, indicating that recruitment of motor units in neither muscle increases with decreasing temperature to compensate for declining contractile rates. These results reveal that specializations in morphology and motor control, not muscle contractile physiology, are responsible for the thermal robustness of tongue projection in chameleons."},{"title":"Acoustic gaze adjustments during active target selection in echolocating porpoises","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4358","abstract":"Visually dominant animals use gaze adjustments to organize perceptual inputs for cognitive processing. Thereby they manage the massive sensory load from complex and noisy scenes. Echolocation, as an active sensory system, may provide more opportunities to control such information flow by adjusting the properties of the sound source. However, most studies of toothed whale echolocation have involved stationed animals in static auditory scenes for which dynamic information control is unnecessary. To mimic conditions in the wild, we designed an experiment with captive, free-swimming harbor porpoises tasked with discriminating between two hydrophone-equipped targets and closing in on the selected target; this allowed us to gain insight into how porpoises adjust their acoustic gaze in a multi-target dynamic scene. By means of synchronized cameras, an acoustic tag and on-target hydrophone recordings we demonstrate that porpoises employ both beam direction control and range-dependent changes in output levels and pulse intervals to accommodate their changing spatial relationship with objects of immediate interest. We further show that, when switching attention to another target, porpoises can set their depth of gaze accurately for the new target location. In combination, these observations imply that porpoises exert precise vocal-motor control that is tied to spatial perception akin to visual accommodation. Finally, we demonstrate that at short target ranges porpoises narrow their depth of gaze dramatically by adjusting their output so as to focus on a single target. This suggests that echolocating porpoises switch from a deliberative mode of sensorimotor operation to a reactive mode when they are close to a target."},{"title":"The ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia is absent in the neonatal fat-tailed dunnart","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4242","abstract":"At birth, the newborn fat-tailed dunnart relies on cutaneous gas exchange to meet metabolic demands, with continuous lung ventilation emerging several days later. We hypothesised that the delayed expression of lung ventilation (VE) in these animals is in part due to a low responsiveness of the respiratory control system to blood gas perturbations. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the ventilatory and metabolic response to hypoxia (10% O2) and hypercapnia (5% CO2) using closed-system respirometry from birth to 23 days postpartum (P). Neonatal fat-tailed dunnarts displayed no significant hypoxic or hypercapnic ventilatory responses at any age. Regardless, significant hyperventilation through a suppression of metabolic rate (VO2) was observed at birth in response to hypercapnia and in response to hypoxia at all ages, except P12. Therefore, reliance on cutaneous gas exchange during early life may be partially attributed to reduced chemosensitivity or a lack of central integration of chemosensitive afferent information. This may be in part due to the relative immaturity of this species at birth, compared with other mammals."},{"title":"Predictive saccade in the absence of smooth pursuit: interception of moving targets in the archer fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4248","abstract":"Interception of fast-moving targets is a demanding task many animals solve. To handle it successfully, mammals employ both saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements in order to confine the target to their area centralis. But how can non-mammalian vertebrates, which lack smooth pursuit, intercept moving targets? We studied this question by exploring eye movement strategies employed by archer fish, an animal that possesses an area centralis, lacks smooth pursuit eye movements, but can intercept moving targets by shooting jets of water at them. We tracked the gaze direction of fish during interception of moving targets and found that they employ saccadic eye movements based on prediction of target position when it is hit. The fish fixates on the target’s initial position for ∼0.2 s from the onset of its motion, a time period used to predict whether a shot can be made before the projection of the target exits the area centralis. If the prediction indicates otherwise, the fish performs a saccade that overshoots the center of gaze beyond the present target projection on the retina, such that after the saccade the moving target remains inside the area centralis long enough to prepare and perform a shot. These results add to the growing body of knowledge on biological target tracking and may shed light on the mechanism underlying this behavior in other animals with no neural system for the generation of smooth pursuit eye movements."},{"title":"Quadrupedal gaits in hexapod animals – inter-leg coordination in free-walking adult stick insects","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4255","abstract":"The analysis of inter-leg coordination in insect walking is generally a study of six-legged locomotion. For decades, the stick insect Carausius morosus has been instrumental for unravelling the rules and mechanisms that control leg coordination in hexapeds. We analysed inter-leg coordination in C. morosus that freely walked on straight paths on plane surfaces with different slopes. Consecutive 1.7 s sections were assigned inter-leg coordination patterns (which we call gaits) based on footfall patterns. Regular gaits, i.e. wave, tetrapod or tripod gaits, occurred in different proportions depending on surface slopes. Tetrapod gaits were observed most frequently, wave gaits only occurred on 90 deg inclining slopes and tripod gaits occurred most often on 15 deg declining slopes, i.e. in 40% of the sections. Depending on the slope, 36–66% of the sections were assigned irregular gaits. Irregular gaits were mostly due to multiple stepping by the front legs, which is perhaps probing behaviour, not phase coupled to the middle legs’ cycles. In irregular gaits, middle leg and hindleg coordination was regular, related to quadrupedal walk and wave gaits. Apparently, front legs uncouple from and couple to the walking system without compromising middle leg and hindleg coordination. In front leg amputees, the remaining legs were strictly coordinated. In hindleg and middle leg amputees, the front legs continued multiple stepping. The coordination of middle leg amputees was maladapted, with front legs and hindlegs performing multiple steps or ipsilateral legs being in simultaneous swing. Thus, afferent information from middle legs might be necessary for a regular hindleg stepping pattern."},{"title":"The impact of acute temperature stress on hemocytes of invasive and native mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis and Mytilus californianus): DNA damage, membrane integrity, apoptosis and signaling pathways","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4267","abstract":"We investigated the effects of acute heat stress and cold stress on cell viability, lysosome membrane stability, double- and single-stranded DNA breakage, and signaling mechanisms involved in cellular homeostasis and apoptosis in hemocytes of native and invasive mussels, Mytilus californianus and Mytilus galloprovincialis, respectively. Both heat stress (28, 32°C) and cold stress (2, 6°C) led to significant double- and single-stranded breaks in DNA. The type and extent of DNA damage were temperature and time dependent, as was caspase-3 activation, an indicator of apoptosis, which may occur in response to DNA damage. Hemocyte viability and lysosomal membrane stability decreased significantly under heat stress. Western blot analyses of hemocyte extracts with antibodies for proteins associated with cell signaling and stress responses [including members of the phospho-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family c-JUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-MAPK, and apoptosis executor caspase-3] revealed that heat and cold stress induced a time-dependent activation of JNK, p38-MAPK and caspase-3 and that these signaling and stress responses differed between species. The thermal limits for activation of cell signaling processes linked to the repair of stress-induced damage may help determine cellular thermal tolerance limits. Our results show similarities in responses to cold and heat stress and suggest causal linkages between levels of DNA damage at both extremes of temperature and downstream regulatory responses, including induction of apoptosis. Compared with M. californianus, M. galloprovincialis might have a wider temperature tolerance due to a lower amount of single- and double-stranded DNA damage, faster signaling activation and transduction, and stronger repair ability against temperature stress."},{"title":"Strike mechanics of an ambush predator: the spearing mantis shrimp","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4374","abstract":"Ambush predation is characterized by an animal scanning the environment from a concealed position and then rapidly executing a surprise attack. Mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda) consist of both ambush predators (‘spearers’) and foragers (‘smashers’). Spearers hide in sandy burrows and capture evasive prey, whereas smashers search for prey away from their burrows and typically hammer hard-shelled, sedentary prey. Here, we examined the kinematics, morphology and field behavior of spearing mantis shrimp and compared them with previously studied smashers. Using two species with dramatically different adult sizes, we found that strikes produced by the diminutive species, Alachosquilla vicina, were faster (mean peak speed 5.72±0.91 m s–1; mean duration 3.26±0.41 ms) than the strikes produced by the large species, Lysiosquillina maculata (mean peak speed 2.30±0.85 m s–1; mean duration 24.98±9.68 ms). Micro-computed tomography and dissections showed that both species have the spring and latch structures that are used in other species for producing a spring-loaded strike; however, kinematic analyses indicated that only A. vicina consistently engages the elastic mechanism. In the field, L. maculata ambushed evasive prey primarily at night while hidden in burrows, striking with both long and short durations compared with laboratory videos. We expected ambush predators to strike with very high speeds, yet instead we found that these spearing mantis shrimp struck more slowly and with longer durations than smashers. Nonetheless, the strikes of spearers occurred at similar speeds and durations to those of other aquatic predators of evasive prey. Although counterintuitive, these findings suggest that ambush predators do not actually need to produce extremely high speeds, and that the very fastest predators are using speed to achieve other mechanical feats, such as producing large impact forces."},{"title":"Sonar jamming in the field: effectiveness and behavior of a unique prey defense","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4278","abstract":"Bats and insects provide a model system for integrating our understanding of predator–prey ecology, animal behavior and neurophysiology. Previous field studies of bat–insect interactions have been limited by the technological challenges involved with studying nocturnal, volant animals that use ultrasound and engage in battles that frequently last a fraction of a second. We overcame these challenges using a robust field methodology that included multiple infrared cameras calibrated for three-dimensional reconstruction of bat and moth flight trajectories and four ultrasonic microphones that provided a spatial component to audio recordings. Our objectives were to document bat–moth interactions in a natural setting and to test the effectiveness of a unique prey defense – sonar jamming. We tested the effect of sonar jamming by comparing the results of interactions between bats and Grote’s tiger moth, Bertholdia trigona, with their sound-producing organs either intact or ablated. Jamming was highly effective, with bats capturing more than 10 times as many silenced moths as clicking moths. Moths frequently combined their acoustic defense with two separate evasive maneuvers: flying away from the bat and diving. Diving decreased bat capture success for both clicking and silenced moths, while flying away did not. The diving showed a strong directional component, a first for insect defensive maneuvers. We discuss the timing of B. trigona defensive maneuvers – which differs from that of other moths – in the context of moth auditory neuroethology. Studying bat–insect interactions in their natural environment provides valuable information that complements work conducted in more controlled settings."},{"title":"MAPK phosphorylation is implicated in the adaptation to desiccation stress in nematodes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4288","abstract":"Some nematodes can survive almost complete desiccation by entering an ametabolic state called anhydrobiosis requiring the accumulation of protective molecules such as trehalose and LEA proteins. However, it is not known how anhydrobiotic organisms sense and regulate the response to water loss. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are highly conserved signalling proteins that regulate adaptation to various stresses. Here, we first compared the anhydrobiotic potential of three nematode species, Caenorhabditis elegans, Aphelenchus avenae and Panagrolaimus superbus, and then determined the phosphorylation status of the MAPKs p38, JNK and ERK during desiccation and rehydration. Caenorhabditis elegans was unable to undergo anhydrobiosis even after an initial phase of slow drying (preconditioning), while A. avenae did survive desiccation after preconditioning. In contrast, P. superbus withstood desiccation under rapid drying conditions, although survival rates improved with preconditioning. These results characterise C. elegans as desiccation sensitive, A. avenae as a slow desiccation strategist anhydrobiote and P. superbus as a fast desiccation strategist anhydrobiote. Both C. elegans and A. avenae showed increased MAPK phosphorylation during drying, consistent with an attempt to mount protection systems against desiccation stress. In P. superbus, however, MAPK phosphorylation was apparent prior to water loss and then decreased on dehydration, suggesting that signal transduction pathways are constitutively active in this nematode. Inhibition of p38 and JNK in P. superbus decreased its desiccation tolerance. This is consistent with the designation of P. superbus as a fast desiccation strategist and its high level of preparedness for anhydrobiosis in the hydrated state. These findings show that MAPKs play an important role in the survival of organisms during anhydrobiosis."},{"title":"Limb force and non-sagittal plane joint moments during maximum-effort curve sprint running in humans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4314","abstract":"Compared with running straight, when human runners sprint along a curve, the ability of the inside leg to generate force is compromised. This decreased force generation has been suggested to limit the overall performance of the runner. One theory for this force loss is that the large non-sagittal plane joint moments of the inside leg reach their operating limits, thus prohibiting further generation of the performance-related sagittal plane joint moments. We investigated the inside leg force generation and the ankle and knee joint moments when 13 subjects sprinted with and without an additional mass of 12.4 kg along a curve of 2.5 m radius. The increase in the subjects’ mass evoked a significant increase in the resultant ground reaction force. The peak non-sagittal plane moments increased significantly for both the ankle and knee joints. This observation suggests that when sprinting normally with maximum effort, the non-sagittal plane joint moments are not operating at their limits. The large increases in ground reaction force were associated with greater extension moments generated at the knee joint. In contrast, the peak ankle plantarflexion moment remained unchanged across conditions. It is possible that for the specific joint configuration experienced, the overall ability to generate plantarflexion moment reaches the limit. Future studies with interventions increasing the ability of the muscle-tendon units to generate plantarflexion moment may provide an experimental opportunity to further examine this speculation."},{"title":"The pro-apoptotic action of the peptide hormone Neb-colloostatin on insect haemocytes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4308","abstract":"The gonadoinhibitory peptide hormone Neb-colloostatin was first isolated from ovaries of the flesh fly Neobellieria bullata. This 19-mer peptide is thought to be a cleaved product of a collagen-like precursor molecule that is formed during remodelling of the extracellular matrix. In this study, we report that upon injection of picomolar and nanomolar doses, this peptide exerts a pro-apoptotic action on haemocytes of Tenebrio molitor adults, as visualized by changes in morphology and viability. The F-actin cytoskeleton was found to aggregate into distinctive patches. This may be responsible for the observed inhibition of adhesion of haemocytes and for the stimulation of filopodia formation. However, Neb-colloostatin injection did not induce the formation of autophagic vacuoles. Our results suggest that physiological concentrations of Neb-colloostatin play an important role in controlling the quantity and activity of haemocytes in insect haemolymph. They also suggest that during periods in which Neb-colloostatin is released, this peptide may cause a weakening of the insects’ immune system. This is the first report that exposure to a peptide hormone causes apoptosis in insect haemocytes."},{"title":"Lipid composition of the stratum corneum and cutaneous water loss in birds along an aridity gradient","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4299","abstract":"Intercellular and covalently bound lipids within the stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of the epidermis, are the primary barrier to cutaneous water loss (CWL) in birds. We compared CWL and intercellular SC lipid composition in 20 species of birds from desert and mesic environments. Furthermore, we compared covalently bound lipids with CWL and intercellular lipids in the lark family (Alaudidae). We found that CWL increases in birds from more mesic environments, and this increase was related to changes in intercellular SC lipid composition. The most consistent pattern that emerged was a decrease in the relative amount of cerebrosides as CWL increased, a pattern that is counterintuitive based on studies of mammals with Gaucher disease. Although covalently bound lipids in larks did not correlate with CWL, we found that covalently bound cerebrosides correlated positively with intercellular cerebrosides and intercellular cholesterol ester, and intercellular cerebrosides correlated positively with covalently bound free fatty acids. Our results led us to propose a new model for the organization of lipids in the avian SC, in which the sugar moieties of cerebrosides lie outside of intercellular lipid layers, where they may interdigitate with adjacent intercellular cerebrosides or with covalently bound cerebrosides."},{"title":"Lipid class and depth-specific thermal properties in the blubber of the short-finned pilot whale and the pygmy sperm whale","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4330","abstract":"Blubber, the specialized hypodermis of cetaceans, provides thermal insulation through the quantity and quality of lipids it contains. Quality refers to percent lipid content; however, not all lipids are the same. Certain deep-diving cetacean groups possess blubber with lipids – wax esters (WE) – that are not typically found in mammals, and the insulative quality of ‘waxy’ blubber is unknown. Our study explored the influence of lipid storage class – specifically WE in pygmy sperm whales (Kogia breviceps; N=7) and typical mammalian triacylglycerols in short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus; N=7) – on blubber’s thermal properties. Although the blubber of both species had similar total lipid contents, the thermal conductivity of G. macrorhynchus blubber (0.20±0.01 W m–1 °C–1) was significantly higher than that of K. breviceps (0.15±0.01 W m–1 °C–1; P=0.0006). These results suggest that lipid class significantly influences the ability of blubber to resist heat flow. In addition, because the lipid content of blubber is known to be stratified, we measured its depth-specific thermal conductivities. In K. breviceps blubber, the depth-specific conductivity values tended to vary inversely with lipid content. In contrast, G. macrorhynchus blubber displayed unexpected depth-specific relationships between lipid content and conductivity, which suggests that temperature-dependent effects, such as melting, may be occurring. Differences in heat flux measurements across the depth of the blubber samples provide evidence that both species are capable of storing heat in their blubber. The function of blubber as an insulator is complex and may rely upon its lipid class, stratified composition and dynamic heat storage capabilities."},{"title":"What’s hot: the enhancing effects of thermal stress on long-term memory formation in Lymnaea stagnalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/24/4322","abstract":"The pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, naturally inhabits slow flowing, shallow and stagnant environments in the northern temperate zone. Consequently, it will experience wide temperature fluctuations dependent on prevailing weather conditions. We hypothesize that periods of warming act as a thermal stressor to alter memory formation. Snails were exposed to an acute 1 h period of 30°C pond water and we determined how memory formation following operant conditioning of aerial respiration was affected. In the snails used here (Dutch strain), a single 0.5 h training session (TS) results in intermediate-term (3 h) but not long-term memory (LTM). Applying the thermal stressor during training caused memory enhancement (i.e. LTM lasting 24 h). However, the breathing rate also increased in warm water, which might explain the enhanced memory. Therefore, we applied the thermal stressor (1 h at 30°C) up to 4 h before or 1 h after training. This did not alter baseline breathing rate during the period when snails would experience training. However, the thermal stressor whether experienced prior to or following the single TS, resulted in an enhanced memory that persisted up to 48h (i.e. LTM). We conclude that memory enhancement is due to the stress associated with the thermal stimulus."},{"title":"The ontogenetic scaling of bite force and head size in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta): implications for durophagy in neritic, benthic habitats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4166","abstract":"Ontogenetic studies of vertebrate feeding performance can help address questions relevant to foraging ecology. Feeding morphology and performance can either limit access to food resources or open up new trophic niches in both aquatic and terrestrial systems. Loggerhead sea turtles are long-lived vertebrates with complex life histories that are marked by an ontogenetic shift from an oceanic habitat to a coastal neritic habitat, and a transition from soft oceanic prey to hard, benthic prey. Although considered durophagous and strong biters, bite performance has not been measured in loggerheads, nor has the ontogeny of bite performance been characterized. In the present study, we collected measurements of bite force in loggerhead turtles from hatchlings to adults. When subadults reach the body size at which the ontogenetic shift occurs, their crushing capability is great enough for them to consume numerous species of hard benthic prey of small sizes. As loggerheads mature and bite performance increases, larger and harder benthic prey become accessible. Loggerhead bite performance eventually surpasses the crushing capability of other durophagous carnivores, thereby potentially reducing competition for hard benthic prey. The increasing bite performance and accompanying changes in morphology of the head and jaws are likely an effective mechanism for resource partitioning and decreasing trophic competition. Simultaneous measurements of body and head size and the use of non-linear reduced major axis regression show that bite force increases with significant positive allometry relative to body size (straight carapace length, straight carapace width and mass) and head size (head width, height and length). Simple correlation showed that all recorded morphometrics were good predictors of measured bite performance, but an AICc-based weighted regression showed that body size (straight carapace width followed by straight carapace length and mass, respectively) were more likely predictors of bite force than head size morphometrics (head width and head length)."},{"title":"Protective effect of hypothermia on brain potassium homeostasis during repetitive anoxia in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4157","abstract":"Oxygen deprivation in nervous tissue depolarizes cell membranes, increasing extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o).

The total [K+]o baseline variation (Δ[K+]o) was stabilized at 17°C (−1.1±1.3 mmol l−1), mildly rose at 23°C (17.3±1.4 mmol l−1), and considerably increased at 29°C (332.7±83.0 mmol l−1). We conclude that (1) reperfusion patterns consisting of long anoxia, short normoxia and high cycle frequency increase disruption of brain [K+]o baseline maintenance, and (2) hypothermia has a protective effect on brain K+ homeostasis during repetitive anoxia. Male flies are suggested as a useful model for examining deleterious consequences of O2 reperfusion with possible application for therapeutic treatment of stroke or heart attack."},{"title":"Beyond the Jamming Avoidance Response: weakly electric fish respond to the envelope of social electrosensory signals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4196","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that central nervous system neurons in weakly electric fish respond to artificially constructed electrosensory envelopes, but the behavioral relevance of such stimuli is unclear. Here we investigate the possibility that social context creates envelopes that drive behavior. When Eigenmannia virescens are in groups of three or more, the interactions between their pseudo-sinusoidal electric fields can generate ‘social envelopes’. We developed a simple mathematical prediction for how fish might respond to such social envelopes. To test this prediction, we measured the responses of E. virescens to stimuli consisting of two sinusoids, each outside the range of the Jamming Avoidance Response (JAR), that when added to the fish's own electric field produced low-frequency (below 10 Hz) social envelopes. Fish changed their electric organ discharge (EOD) frequency in response to these envelopes, which we have termed the Social Envelope Response (SER). In 99% of trials, the direction of the SER was consistent with the mathematical prediction. The SER was strongest in response to the lowest initial envelope frequency tested (2 Hz) and depended on stimulus amplitude. The SER generally resulted in an increase of the envelope frequency during the course of a trial, suggesting that this behavior may be a mechanism for avoiding low-frequency social envelopes. Importantly, the direction of the SER was not predicted by the superposition of two JAR responses: the SER was insensitive to the amplitude ratio between the sinusoids used to generate the envelope, but was instead predicted by the sign of the difference of difference frequencies."},{"title":"Parental hypoxic exposure confers offspring hypoxia resistance in zebrafish (Danio rerio)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4208","abstract":"Parental influences are a potentially important component of transgenerational transfer of phenotype in vertebrates. This study examined how chronic hypoxic exposure on adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) affected the phenotype of their offspring. Separate adult populations were exposed to hypoxia (13.1 kPa O2) or normoxia (21.1 kPa O2) for periods ranging from 1 to 12 weeks. Adults were then returned to normoxia and bred within experimental groups. Adult fecundity and egg characteristics (volume of egg, yolk and perivitelline fluid) were assessed. Subsequently, larval body length, time to loss of equilibrium in severe hypoxia (~4 kPa O2), and critical thermal minima (CTmin) and maxima (CTmax) were measured at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 60 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.). Adult fecundity was depressed by hypoxic exposure. Egg component volumes were also depressed in adults exposed to 1–2 weeks of hypoxia, but returned to control levels following longer hypoxic exposure. Adult hypoxic exposures of >1 week resulted in longer body lengths in their larval offspring. Time to loss of equilibrium in severe hypoxia (i.e. hypoxic resistance) in control larvae decreased from 6 to 12 d.p.f., remaining constant thereafter. Notably, hypoxic resistance from 6 to 18 d.p.f. was ~15% lower in larvae whose parents were exposed to just 1 week of chronic hypoxia, but resistance was significantly increased by ~24–30% in 6–18 d.p.f. larvae from adults exposed to 2, 3 or 4 weeks of hypoxia. CTmin (~10–12°C) and CTmax (~39.5°C) were unchanged by parental hypoxic exposure. This study demonstrates that parental hypoxic exposure in adult zebrafish has profound epigenetic effects on the morphological and physiological phenotype of their offspring."},{"title":"Dine or dash? Turbulence inhibits blue crab navigation in attractive–aversive odor plumes by altering signal structure encoded by the olfactory pathway","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4175","abstract":"Blue crabs can distinguish and navigate to attractive (food) odors even when aversive odors (injured crab metabolites) are released nearby. Blue crabs in these conditions detect the aversive odor and avoid it, but find the attractive source with nearly the same success rate as when the attractive source is presented alone. Spatially and temporally distinct odor filaments appear to signal to foragers that the two odor sources are not co-located, and hence navigating to the attractive odor entails an acceptable risk of predation. However, environmentally produced turbulence suppresses tracking by homogenizing the two odors; blue crabs fail to track to the attractive source when the aversive source is present, even though turbulence does not substantially inhibit tracking to the attractive source alone. Removal of sensory input from aesthetascs on the antennules, but not chemosensors on the legs, rescues navigation to attractive–aversive dual plumes in turbulent conditions. These results suggest that mixing in the natural environment may amplify the effects of predators by suppressing tracking to food odors when aversive cues are present, and that the olfactory pathway mediates the response."},{"title":"The effects of a variable temperature regime on the physiology of the reef-building coral Seriatopora hystrix: results from a laboratory-based reciprocal transplant","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4183","abstract":"To understand the effects of global climate change on reef-building corals, a thorough investigation of their physiological mechanisms of acclimatization is warranted. However, static temperature manipulations may underestimate the thermal complexity of the reefs in which many corals live. For instance, corals of Houbihu, Taiwan, experience changes in temperature of up to 10°C over the course of a day during spring-tide upwelling events. To better understand the phenotypic plasticity of these corals, a laboratory-based experiment was conducted whereby specimens of Seriatopora hystrix from an upwelling reef (Houbihu) and conspecifics from a non-upwelling reef (Houwan) were exposed to both a stable seawater temperature (26°C) regime and a regime characterized by a 6°C fluctuation (23–29°C) over a 12 h period for 7 days. A suite of physiological and molecular parameters was measured in samples of both treatments, as well as in experimental controls, to determine site of origin (SO) and temperature treatment (TT) responses. Only chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and growth demonstrated the hypothesized trend of higher levels when exposed to a TT that mimicked SO conditions. In contrast, chl a, maximum dark-adapted quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), and Symbiodinium ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL), photosystem I (psI, subunit III) and phosphoglycolate phosphatase (pgpase) mRNA expression demonstrated significant TT effects. Specifically, levels of these response variables were higher in samples exposed to a variable temperature regime, suggesting that S. hystrix may acclimate to fluctuating temperatures by increasing its capacity for photosynthesis."},{"title":"Structure, innervation and response properties of integumentary sensory organs in crocodilians","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4217","abstract":"Integumentary sensory organs (ISOs) are densely distributed on the jaws of crocodilians and on body scales of members of the families Crocodilidae and Gavialidae. We examined the distribution, anatomy, innervation and response properties of ISOs on the face and body of crocodilians and documented related behaviors for an alligatorid (Alligator mississippiensis) and a crocodylid (Crocodylus niloticus). Each of the ISOs (roughly 4000 in A. mississippiensis and 9000 in C. niloticus) was innervated by networks of afferents supplying multiple different mechanoreceptors. Electrophysiological recordings from the trigeminal ganglion and peripheral nerves were made to isolate single-unit receptive fields and to test possible osmoreceptive and electroreceptive functions. Multiple small (<0.1 mm2) receptive fields, often from a single ISO, were recorded from the premaxilla, the rostral dentary, the gingivae and the distal digits. These responded to a median threshold of 0.08 mN. The less densely innervated caudal margins of the jaws had larger receptive fields (>100 mm2) and higher thresholds (13.725 mN). Rapidly adapting, slowly adapting type I and slowly adapting type II responses were identified based on neuronal responses. Several rapidly adapting units responded maximally to vibrations at 20–35 Hz, consistent with reports of the ISOs' role in detecting prey-generated water surface ripples. Despite crocodilians' armored bodies, the ISOs imparted a mechanical sensitivity exceeding that of primate fingertips. We conclude that crocodilian ISOs have diverse functions, including detection of water movements, indicating when to bite based on direct contact of pursued prey, and fine tactile discrimination of items held in the jaws."},{"title":"Comparative intralimb coordination in avian bipedal locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4055","abstract":"Analyses of how intralimb coordination during locomotion varies within and across different taxa are necessary for understanding the morphological and neurological basis for locomotion in general. Previous findings suggest that intralimb proportions are the major source of kinematic variation that governs intralimb coordination across taxa. Also, independence of kinematics from habitat preference and phylogenetic position has been suggested for mammals. This leads to the hypothesis that among equally sized bird species exhibiting equal limb proportions, similar kinematics can be observed. To test this hypothesis, the bipedal locomotion of two distantly related ground-dwelling bird species (Eudromia elegans and Coturnix coturnix) and of a less terrestrial species (Corvus monedula) was investigated by means of a biplanar high-speed X-ray videographic analysis. Birds exhibited similar intralimb proportions and were filmed over a broad range of speed while moving on a treadmill. Joint and limb element angles, as well as pelvic rotations, were quantified. Regarding fore–aft motions of the limb joints and elements, a congruent pattern of intralimb coordination was observed among all experimental species. The sample of species suggests that this is largely independent of their habitat preference and systematic position and seems to be related to demands for coping with an irregular terrain with a minimum of necessary control. Hence, the initial hypothesis was confirmed. However, this congruence is not found when looking at medio-lateral limb motions and pelvic rotations, showing distinct differences between ground-dwellers (e.g. largely restricted to a parasagittal plane) and C. monedula (e.g. increased mobility of the hip joint)."},{"title":"Wingbeat kinematics and motor control of yaw turns in Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte anna)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4070","abstract":"The biomechanical and neuromuscular mechanisms used by different animals to generate turns in flight are highly variable. Body size and body plan exert some influence, e.g. birds typically roll their body to orient forces generated by the wings whereas insects are capable of turning via left–right wingbeat asymmetries. Turns are also relatively brief and have low repeatability, with almost every wingbeat serving a different function throughout the change in heading. Here we present an analysis of Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte anna) as they fed continuously from an artificial feeder revolving around the outside of the animal. This setup allowed for examination of sustained changes in yaw without requiring any corresponding changes in pitch, roll or body position. Hummingbirds sustained yaw turns by expanding the wing stroke amplitude of the outer wing during the downstroke and by altering the deviation of the wingtip path during both downstroke and upstroke. The latter led to a shift in the inner–outer stroke plane angle during the upstroke and shifts in the elevation of the stroke plane and in the deviation of the wingtip path during both strokes. These features are generally more similar to how insects, as opposed to birds, turn. However, time series analysis also revealed considerable stroke-to-stroke variation. Changes in the stroke amplitude and the wingtip velocity were highly cross-correlated, as were changes in the stroke deviation and the elevation of the stroke plane. As was the case for wingbeat kinematics, electromyogram recordings from pectoral and wing muscles were highly variable, but no correlations were found between these two features of motor control. The high variability of both kinematic and muscle activation features indicates a high level of wingbeat-to-wingbeat adjustments during sustained yaw. The activation timing of the muscles was more repeatable than the activation intensity, which suggests that the former may be constrained by harmonic motion and that the latter may play a large role in kinematic adjustments. Comparing the revolution frequency of the feeder with measurements of free flight yaws reveals that feeder tracking, even at one revolution every 2 s, is well below the maximum yaw capacity of the hummingbirds."},{"title":"Nocturnal light environments and species ecology: implications for nocturnal color vision in forests","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4085","abstract":"Although variation in the color of light in terrestrial diurnal and twilight environments has been well documented, relatively little work has examined the color of light in nocturnal habitats. Understanding the range and sources of variation in nocturnal light environments has important implications for nocturnal vision, particularly following recent discoveries of nocturnal color vision. In this study, we measured nocturnal irradiance in a dry forest/woodland and a rainforest in Madagascar over 34 nights. We found that a simple linear model including the additive effects of lunar altitude, lunar phase and canopy openness successfully predicted total irradiance flux measurements across 242 clear sky measurements (r=0.85, P<0.0001). However, the relationship between these variables and spectral irradiance was more complex, as interactions between lunar altitude, lunar phase and canopy openness were also important predictors of spectral variation. Further, in contrast to diurnal conditions, nocturnal forests and woodlands share a yellow-green-dominant light environment with peak flux at 560 nm. To explore how nocturnal light environments influence nocturnal vision, we compared photoreceptor spectral tuning, habitat preference and diet in 32 nocturnal mammals. In many species, long-wavelength-sensitive cone spectral sensitivity matched the peak flux present in nocturnal forests and woodlands, suggesting a possible adaptation to maximize photon absorption at night. Further, controlling for phylogeny, we found that fruit/flower consumption significantly predicted short-wavelength-sensitive cone spectral tuning in nocturnal mammals (P=0.002). These results suggest that variation in nocturnal light environments and species ecology together influence cone spectral tuning and color vision in nocturnal mammals."},{"title":"Does immune suppression during stress occur to promote physical performance?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4097","abstract":"Two adaptationist hypotheses have been proposed to explain why stress, particularly elevation of stress hormones (i.e. glucocorticoids), tends to suppress immune functions. One is that immune suppression represents efforts to minimize autoimmune responses to self-antigens released as organisms cope with stressors (i.e. the autoimmune-avoidance hypothesis). The other is that immune suppression occurs to promote a shunting of resources to life processes more conducive to survival of the stressor (i.e. the re-allocation hypothesis). Here in wild-caught house sparrows (Passer domesticus), we tested the second hypothesis, asking whether sustained elevation of baseline glucocorticoids, due to captivity, caused a greater rate of decline in immune functions than flight performance. A greater decline in immune functions than flight performance would support the re-allocation hypothesis. As in previous studies, we found that captivity tended to alter baseline corticosterone, suggesting that house sparrows experience captivity as a stressor. Captivity also affected several constitutive and induced innate immune metrics: bacterial (Escherichia coli) killing activity of blood and oxidative burst of leukocytes both changed in a manner consistent with immune disregulation. In contrast, breast muscle size and vertical flight (hovering) duration improved over captivity. Collectively, these changes provide indirect support for the re-allocation hypothesis, although within individuals, changes in immune and physical performance were unrelated."},{"title":"Muscle function during takeoff and landing flight in the pigeon (Columba livia)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4104","abstract":"This study explored the muscle strain and activation patterns of several key flight muscles of the pigeon (Columba livia) during takeoff and landing flight. Using electromyography (EMG) to measure muscle activation, and sonomicrometry to quantify muscle strain, we evaluated the muscle function patterns of the pectoralis, biceps, humerotriceps and scapulotriceps as pigeons flew between two perches. These recordings were analyzed in the context of three-dimensional wing kinematics. To understand the different requirements of takeoff, midflight and landing, we compared the activity and strain of these muscles among the three flight modes. The pectoralis and biceps exhibited greater fascicle strain rates during takeoff than during midflight or landing. However, the triceps muscles did not exhibit notable differences in strain among flight modes. All observed strain, activation and kinematics were consistent with hypothesized muscle functions. The biceps contracted to stabilize and flex the elbow during the downstroke. The humerotriceps contracted to extend the elbow at the upstroke–downstroke transition, followed by scapulotriceps contraction to maintain elbow extension during the downstroke. The scapulotriceps also appeared to contribute to humeral elevation. Greater muscle activation intensity was observed during takeoff, compared with mid-flight and landing, in all muscles except the scapulotriceps. The timing patterns of muscle activation and length change differed among flight modes, yet demonstrated that pigeons do not change the basic mechanical actions of key flight muscles as they shift from flight activities that demand energy production, such as takeoff and midflight, to maneuvers that require absorption of energy, such as landing. Similarly, joint kinematics were consistent among flight modes. The stereotypy of these neuromuscular and joint kinematic patterns is consistent with previously observed stereotypy of wing kinematics relative to the pigeon's body (in the local body frame) across these flight behaviors. Taken together, these observations suggest that the control of takeoff and landing flight primarily involves modulation of overall body pitch to effect changes in stroke plane angle and resulting wing aerodynamics."},{"title":"Feel, smell and see in an egg: emergence of perception and learning in an immature invertebrate, the cuttlefish embryo","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4125","abstract":"It is now well established that prenatal sensory experience affects development itself and has long-term consequences in terms of postnatal behavior. This study focused on the functionality of the sensory system in cuttlefish in ovo. Embryos of stage 23, 25 and 30 received a tactile, chemical or visual stimulus. An increase of mantle contraction rhythm was taken to indicate a behavioral response to the stimulus. We clearly demonstrated that tactile and chemical systems are functional from stage 23, whereas the visual system is functional only from stage 25. At stage 25 and 30, embryos were also exposed to a repeated light stimulus. Stage 30 embryos were capable of habituation, showing a progressive decrease in contractions across stimulations. This process was not due to fatigue as we observed response recovery after a dishabituation tactile stimulus. This study is the first to show that cuttlefish embryos behaviorally respond to stimuli of different modalities and that the visual system is the last to become functional during embryonic development, as in vertebrate embryos. It also provides new evidence that the memory system develops in ovo in cuttlefish."},{"title":"Transition from leg to wing forces during take-off in birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4115","abstract":"Take-off mechanics are fundamental to the ecology and evolution of flying animals. Recent research has revealed that initial take-off velocity in birds is driven mostly by hindlimb forces. However, the contribution of the wings during the transition to air is unknown. To investigate this transition, we integrated measurements of both leg and wing forces during take-off and the first three wingbeats in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata, body mass 15 g, N=7) and diamond dove (Geopelia cuneata, body mass 50 g, N=3). We measured ground reaction forces produced by the hindlimbs using a perch mounted on a force plate, whole-body and wing kinematics using high-speed video, and aerodynamic forces using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Take-off performance was generally similar between species. When birds were perched, an acceleration peak produced by the legs contributed to 85±1% of the whole-body resultant acceleration in finch and 77±6% in dove. At lift-off, coincident with the start of the first downstroke, the percentage of hindlimb contribution to initial flight velocity was 93.6±0.6% in finch and 95.2±0.4% in dove. In finch, the first wingbeat produced 57.9±3.4% of the lift created during subsequent wingbeats compared with 62.5±2.2% in dove. Advance ratios were <0.5 in both species, even when taking self-convection of shed vortices into account, so it was likely that wing–wake interactions dominated aerodynamics during wingbeats 2 and 3. These results underscore the relatively low contribution of the wings to initial take-off, and reveal a novel transitional role for the first wingbeat in terms of force production."},{"title":"Swimming away or clamming up: the use of phasic and tonic adductor muscles during escape responses varies with shell morphology in scallops","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4131","abstract":"The simple locomotor system of scallops facilitates the study of muscle use during locomotion. We compared five species of scallops with different shell morphologies to see whether shell morphology and muscle use change in parallel or whether muscle use can compensate for morphological constraints. Force recordings during escape responses revealed that the use of tonic and phasic contractions varied markedly among species. The active species, Amusium balloti, Placopecten magellanicus and Pecten fumatus, made more phasic contractions than the more sedentary species, Mimachlamys asperrima and Crassadoma gigantea. Tonic contractions varied considerably among these species, with the two more sedentary species often starting their response to the predator with a tonic contraction and the more active species using shorter tonic contractions between series of phasic contractions. Placopecten magellanicus made extensive use of short tonic contractions. Pecten fumatus mounted an intense series of phasic contractions at the start of its response, perhaps to overcome the constraints of its unfavourable shell morphology. Valve closure by the more sedentary species suggests that their shell morphology protects them against predation, whereas swimming by the more active species relies upon intense phasic contractions together with favourable shell characteristics."},{"title":"Biomechanical determinants of transverse and rotary gallop in cursorial mammals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/23/4144","abstract":"Transverse and rotary gallop differ in the placement of the leading hindfeet and forefeet: ipsilateral in the former gait, contralateral in the latter. We analysed 351 filmed sequences to assess the gallop type of 89 investigated mammalian species belonging to Carnivora, Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla orders. Twenty-three biometrical, ecological and physiological parameters were collected for each species both from literature data and from animal specimens. Most of the species showed only one kind of gallop: transverse (42%) or rotary (39%), while some species performed rotary gallop only at high speed (19%). In a factorial analysis, the first principal component (PC), which accounted for 40% of the total variance, was positively correlated to the relative speed and negatively correlated to size and body mass. The second PC was correlated to the ratio between distal and proximal limb segments. Large size and longer proximal limb segments were associated with transverse gallop, while rotary and speed-dependent species showed higher metacarpus/humerus and metatarsus/femur length ratio and faster relative speeds. The resulting limb excursion angles were proportional to the square-root of the Froude number, and significantly higher in rotary gallopers. The gait pattern analysis indicated significant differences between transverse and rotary gallop in forelimb and hindlimb duty factor (t-test; P<0.001), and in duration of the forelimb contact (t-test; P=0.045). Our results show that an exclusive gallop gait is adopted by a large number of mammalian species, and indicate that the gallop pattern depends on diverse environmental, morphometrical and biomechanical characters."},{"title":"Serotonergic neuroepithelial cells of the skin in developing zebrafish: morphology, innervation and oxygen-sensitive properties","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3881","abstract":"In teleost fish, O2 chemoreceptors of the gills (neuroepithelial cells or NECs) initiate cardiorespiratory reflexes during hypoxia. In developing zebrafish, hyperventilatory and behavioural responses to hypoxia are observed before development of gill NECs, indicating that extrabranchial chemoreceptors mediate these responses in embryos. We have characterised a population of cells of the skin in developing zebrafish that resemble O2-chemoreceptive gill NECs. Skin NECs were identified by serotonin immunolabelling and were distributed over the entire skin surface. These cells contained synaptic vesicles and were associated with nerve fibres. Skin NECs were first evident in embryos 24–26 h post-fertilisation (h.p.f.), and embryos developed a behavioural response to hypoxia between 24 and 48 h.p.f. The total number of NECs declined with age from approximately 300 cells per larva at 3 days post-fertilisation (d.p.f.) to ~120 cells at 7 d.p.f., and were rarely observed in adults. Acclimation to hypoxia (30 mmHg) or hyperoxia (300 mmHg) resulted in delayed or accelerated development, respectively, of peak resting ventilatory frequency and produced changes in the ventilatory response to hypoxia. In hypoxia-acclimated larvae, the temporal pattern of skin NECs was altered such that the number of cells did not decrease with age. By contrast, hyperoxia produced a more rapid decline in NEC number. The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine degraded catecholaminergic nerve terminals that made contact with skin NECs and eliminated the hyperventilatory response to hypoxia. These results indicate that skin NECs are sensitive to changes in O2 and suggest that they may play a role in initiating responses to hypoxia in developing zebrafish."},{"title":"Experimental selection for body size at age modifies early life-history traits and muscle gene expression in adult zebrafish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3895","abstract":"The short generation time of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) was exploited to investigate the effects of selection for body size at age on early life-history traits and on the transcriptional response to a growth stimulus in skeletal muscle of adult fish.

Body mass was on average 16.3% and 41.0% higher in the L- than in the U- and S-lineages, respectively. Egg diameter was 6.4% lower with 13% less yolk in the S-lineage compared with the other lineages. Maternal transcripts for igf2r, bmpr1aa, igf1ar, igf2a, igfbp5a, ghra and igfbp3 in 2–4 cell stage embryos were higher in the L- than in the S-lineage.

On average, brain temperature was 0.24±0.05°C lower than carotid blood temperature for four oryx in April. Selective brain cooling was enhanced in our Arabian oryx compared with another species from the same genus (gemsbok Oryx gazella gazella) exposed to similar ambient temperatures but less aridity. Arabian oryx displayed a lower threshold (37.8±0.1°C vs 39.8±0.4°C), a higher frequency (87±6% vs 15±15%) and a higher maximum magnitude (1.2±0.2°C vs 0.5±0.3°C) of selective brain cooling than did gemsbok. The dominant male oryx displayed less selective brain cooling than did any of the other oryx, but selective brain cooling was enhanced in this oryx as conditions became hotter and drier. Enhanced selective brain cooling in Arabian oryx supports the hypothesis that selective brain cooling would bestow survival advantages for artiodactyl species inhabiting hot hyper-arid environments."},{"title":"Proteomics of hyposaline stress in blue mussel congeners (genus Mytilus): implications for biogeographic range limits in response to climate change","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3905","abstract":"Climate change is affecting species' physiology, pushing environmental tolerance limits and shifting distribution ranges. In addition to temperature and ocean acidification, increasing levels of hyposaline stress due to extreme precipitation events and freshwater runoff may be driving some of the reported recent range shifts in marine organisms. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry, we characterized the proteomic responses of the cold-adapted blue mussel Mytilus trossulus, a native to the Pacific coast of North America, and the warm-adapted M. galloprovincialis, a Mediterranean invader that has replaced the native from the southern part of its range, but may be limited from expanding north due to hyposaline stress. After exposing laboratory-acclimated mussels for 4 h to two different experimental treatments of hyposaline conditions and one control treatment (24.5, 29.8 and 35.0 psu, respectively) followed by a 0 and 24 h recovery at ambient salinity (35 psu), we detected changes in the abundance of molecular chaperones of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), indicating protein unfolding, during stress exposure. Other common responses included changes in small GTPases of the Ras superfamily during recovery, which suggests a role for vesicle transport, and cytoskeletal adjustments associated with cell volume, as indicated by cytoskeletal elements such as actin, tubulin, intermediate filaments and several actin-binding regulatory proteins. Changes of proteins involved in energy metabolism and scavenging of reactive oxygen species suggest a reduction in overall energy metabolism during recovery. Principal component analyses of protein abundances suggest that M. trossulus is able to respond to a greater hyposaline challenge (24.5 psu) than M. galloprovincialis (29.8 psu), as shown by changing abundances of proteins involved in protein chaperoning, vesicle transport, cytoskeletal adjustments by actin-regulatory proteins, energy metabolism and oxidative stress. While proteins involved in energy metabolism were lower in M. trossulus during recovery from hyposaline stress, M. galloprovincialis showed higher abundances of those proteins at 29.8 psu, suggesting an energetic constraint in the invader but not the native congener. Both species showed lower levels of oxidative stress proteins during recovery. In addition, oxidative stress proteins associated with protein synthesis and folding in the ER showed lower levels during recovery in M. galloprovincialis, in parallel with ER chaperones, indicating a reduction in protein synthesis. These differences may enable the native M. trossulus to cope with greater hyposaline stress in the northern part of its range, as well as to outcompete M. galloprovincialis in the southern part of M. trossulus' range, thereby preventing M. galloprovincialis from expanding further north."},{"title":"Self-cleaning in tree frog toe pads; a mechanism for recovering from contamination without the need for grooming","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3965","abstract":"Tree frogs use adhesive toe pads for climbing on a variety of surfaces.

We compared adhesive forces prior to and after contamination of (1) the whole animal on a rotatable platform and (2) individual toe pads in restrained frogs mimicking individual steps using a motorised stage. In both cases, the adhesive forces recovered after a few steps but this took significantly longer in single toe pad experiments from restrained frogs, showing that use of the pads increases recovery.

However, adults may still use suckers to re-scale waterfalls if displaced. If attachment force is proportional to sucker area and if growth of the sucker is isometric, then increases in the forces that climbing fish must resist might outpace adhesive capacity, causing climbing performance to decline through ontogeny. To test for such trends, we measured pressure differentials and adhesive suction forces generated by the pelvic sucker across wide size ranges in six goby species, including climbing and non-climbing taxa. Suction was achieved via two distinct growth strategies: (1) small suckers with isometric (or negatively allometric) scaling among climbing gobies and (2) large suckers with positively allometric growth in non-climbing gobies. Species using the first strategy show a high baseline of adhesive capacity that may aid climbing performance throughout ontogeny, with pressure differentials and suction forces much greater than expected if adhesion were a passive function of sucker area. In contrast, large suckers possessed by non-climbing species may help compensate for reduced pressure differentials, thereby producing suction sufficient to support body weight. Climbing Sicyopterus species also use oral suckers during climbing waterfalls, and these exhibited scaling patterns similar to those for pelvic suckers. However, oral suction force was considerably lower than that for pelvic suckers, reducing the ability for these fish to attach to substrates by the oral sucker alone."},{"title":"Pre- and post-natal stress in context: effects on the stress physiology in a precocial bird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3955","abstract":"Developmental stress can significantly influence physiology and survival in many species. Mammalian studies suggest that pre- and post-natal stress can have different effects (i.e. hyper- or hypo-responsiveness) on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, the main mediator of the stress response. In mammals, the physiological intimacy between mother and offspring constrains the possibility to control, and therefore manipulate, maternal pre- and post-natal influences. Here, using the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) as our model, we elevated levels of the glucocorticoid stress hormone corticosterone in ovo and/or in the endogenous circulation of hatchlings. We examined the effects of treatments on corticosterone and glucose stress responses at two different ages, in juvenile and adult quail. In juveniles, corticosterone data revealed a sex-specific effect of post-natal treatment regardless of the previous pre-natal protocol, with post-natally treated females showing shorter stress responses in comparison with the other groups, while no differences were observed among males. In adulthood, birds previously stressed as embryos showed higher corticosterone concentrations over the stress response compared with controls. This effect was not evident in birds subjected to either post-natal treatment or the combined treatments. There were no effects on glucose in the juveniles. However, adult birds previously stressed in ovo showed opposite sex-specific basal glucose patterns compared with the other groups. Our results demonstrate that (1) early glucocorticoid exposure can have both transient and long-term effects on the HPA axis, depending upon the developmental stage and sex and (2) post-natal stress can modulate the effects of pre-natal stress on HPA activity."},{"title":"Gill remodelling during terrestrial acclimation reduces aquatic respiratory function of the amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3973","abstract":"The skin-breathing amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus experiences rapid environmental changes when moving between water- and air-breathing, but remodelling of respiratory morphology is slower (~1 week). We tested the hypotheses that (1) there is a trade-off in respiratory function of gills displaying aquatic versus terrestrial morphologies and (2) rapidly increased gill ventilation is a mechanism to compensate for reduced aquatic respiratory function. Gill surface area, which varied inversely to the height of the interlamellar cell mass, was increased by acclimating fish for 1 week to air or low ion water, or decreased by acclimating fish for 1 week to hypoxia (~20% dissolved oxygen saturation). Fish were subsequently challenged with acute hypoxia, and gill ventilation or oxygen uptake was measured. Fish with reduced gill surface area increased ventilation at higher dissolved oxygen levels, showed an increased critical partial pressure of oxygen and suffered impaired recovery compared with brackish water control fish. These results indicate that hyperventilation, a rapid compensatory mechanism, was only able to maintain oxygen uptake during moderate hypoxia in fish that had remodelled their gills for land. Thus, fish moving between aquatic and terrestrial habitats may benefit from cutaneously breathing oxygen-rich air, but upon return to water must compensate for a less efficient branchial morphology (mild hypoxia) or suffer impaired respiratory function (severe hypoxia)."},{"title":"High oxidative capacity and type IIx fibre content in springbok and fallow deer skeletal muscle suggest fast sprinters with a resistance to fatigue","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3997","abstract":"Some wild antelopes are fast sprinters and more resistant to fatigue than others. This study therefore investigated two wild antelope species to better understand their reported performance capability. Muscle samples collected post mortem from the vastus lateralis and longissimus lumborum of fallow deer (Dama dama) and springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) were analysed for myosin heavy chain isoform content, citrate synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities. Cross-sectional areas, fibre type and oxidative capacities of each fibre type were determined in the vastus lateralis only. The predominant fibre type in both muscle groups and species were type IIX (>50%), with springbok having more type IIX fibres than fallow deer (P<0.05). Overall cross-sectional area was not different between the two species. The metabolic pathway analyses showed high glycolytic and oxidative capacities for both species, but springbok had significantly higher CS activities than fallow deer. Large variation and overlap in oxidative capacities existed within and between the fibre types. Some type IIX fibres presented with oxidative capacities similar to those from type I and IIA fibres. The data suggest that springbok and fallow deer are able sprint at >90 and 46 km h−1, respectively, partly from having large type IIX fibre contents and high glycolytic capacities. The high oxidative capacities also suggest that these animals may be able to withstand fatigue for long periods of time."},{"title":"Honeybees consolidate navigation memory during sleep","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3981","abstract":"Sleep is known to support memory consolidation in animals, including humans. Here we ask whether consolidation of novel navigation memory in honeybees depends on sleep. Foragers were exposed to a forced navigation task in which they learned to home more efficiently from an unexpected release site by acquiring navigational memory during the successful homing flight. This task was quantified using harmonic radar tracking and applied to bees that were equipped with a radio frequency identification device (RFID). The RFID was used to record their outbound and inbound flights and continuously monitor their behavior inside the colony, including their rest during the day and sleep at night. Bees marked with the RFID behaved normally inside and outside the hive. Bees slept longer during the night following forced navigation tasks, but foraging flights of different lengths did not lead to different rest times during the day or total sleep time during the night. Sleep deprivation before the forced navigation task did not alter learning and memory acquired during the task. However, sleep deprivation during the night after forced navigation learning reduced the probability of returning successfully to the hive from the same release site. It is concluded that consolidation of novel navigation memory is facilitated by night sleep in bees."},{"title":"Body dynamics and hydrodynamics of swimming fish larvae: a computational study","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/4015","abstract":"To understand the mechanics of fish swimming, we need to know the forces exerted by the fluid and how these forces affect the motion of the fish. To this end, we developed a 3-D computational approach that integrates hydrodynamics and body dynamics. This study quantifies the flow around a swimming zebrafish (Danio rerio) larva. We used morphological and kinematics data from actual fish larvae aged 3 and 5 days post fertilization as input for a computational model that predicted free-swimming dynamics from prescribed changes in body shape. We simulated cyclic swimming and a spontaneous C-start. A rigorous comparison with 2-D particle image velocimetry and kinematics data revealed that the computational model accurately predicted the motion of the fish's centre of mass as well as the spatial and temporal characteristics of the flow. The distribution of pressure and shear forces along the body showed that thrust is mainly produced in the posterior half of the body. We also explored the effect of the body wave amplitude on swimming performance by considering wave amplitudes that were up to 40% larger or smaller than the experimentally observed value. Increasing the body wave amplitude increased forward swimming speed from 7 to 21 body lengths per second, which is consistent with experimental observations. The model also predicted a non-linear increase in propulsive efficiency from 0.22 to 0.32 while the required mechanical power quadrupled. The efficiency increase was only minor for wave amplitudes above the experimental reference value, whereas the cost of transport rose significantly."},{"title":"Cell death and renewal during prey capture and digestion in the carnivorous sponge Asbestopluma hypogea (Porifera: Poecilosclerida)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3937","abstract":"The sponge Asbestopluma hypogea is unusual among sponges due to its peculiar carnivorous feeding habit. During various stages of its nutrition cycle, the sponge is subjected to spectacular morphological modifications. Starved animals are characterized by many elongated filaments, which are crucial for the capture of prey. After capture, and during the digestion process, these filaments actively regress before being regenerated during a subsequent period of starvation. Here, we demonstrate that these morphological events rely on a highly dynamic cellular turnover, implying a coordinated sequence of programmed cell death (apoptosis and autophagy), cell proliferation and cell migration. A candidate niche for cell renewal by stem cell proliferation and differentiation was identified at the base of the sponge peduncle, characterized by higher levels of BrdU/EdU incorporation. Therefore, BrdU/EdU-positive cells of the peduncle base are candidate motile cells responsible for the regeneration of the prey-capturing main sponge body, i.e. the dynamic filaments. Altogether, our results demonstrate that dynamics of cell renewal in sponge appear to be regulated by cellular mechanisms as multiple and complex as those already identified in bilaterian metazoans."},{"title":"Disrupted flow sensing impairs hydrodynamic performance and increases the metabolic cost of swimming in the yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3944","abstract":"The yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi, shows a distribution of anaerobic and aerobic (red and pink) muscle fibres along the trunk that is characteristic of active pelagic fishes. The athletic capacity of S. lalandi is also shown by its relative high standard metabolic rate and optimal (i.e. least cost) swimming speed. To test the hypothesis that lateral line afferent information contributes to efficient locomotion in an active pelagic species, the swimming performance of S. lalandi was evaluated after unilateral disruption of trunk superficial neuromasts (SNs). Unilaterally disrupting the SNs of the lateral line impaired both swimming performance and energetic efficiency. The critical swimming speed (Ucrit; mean ± s.d., N=12) for unilaterally SN-disrupted fish was 2.11±0.96 fork lengths (FL) s−1, which was significantly slower than the 3.66±0.19 FL s−1 Ucrit of sham SN-disrupted fish. The oxygen consumption rate (mg O2 kg−1 min−1) of the unilaterally SN-disrupted fish in a speed range of 1.0–2.2 FL s−1 was significantly greater than that of the sham SN-disrupted fish. The least gross cost of transport (GCOT; N=6) for SN-disrupted fish was 0.18±0.06 J N−1 m−1, which was significantly greater than the 0.11±0.03 J N−1 m−1 GCOT for sham SN-disrupted fish. The factorial metabolic scope (N=6) of the unilaterally SN-disrupted fish (2.87±0.78) was significantly less than that of sham controls (4.14±0.37).

Intrinsic heart rate (fH) decreased from 41 beats min−1 at 10°C to 33 beats min−1 at 4°C and 25 beats min−1 at 0°C. However, this degree of thermal dependency was not reflected in maximal cardiac output (Qmax values were ~44, ~37 and ~34 ml min−1 kg−1 at 10, 4 and 0°C, respectively). Further, cardiac scope showed a slight positive compensation between 4 and 0°C (Q10=1.7), and full, if not a slight over compensation between 10 and 4°C (Q10=0.9). The maximal performance of hearts exposed to an acute decrease in temperature (i.e. from 10 to 4°C and 4 to 0°C) was comparable to that measured for hearts from 4°C- and 0°C-acclimated fish, respectively. In contrast, 4°C-acclimated hearts significantly out-performed 10°C-acclimated hearts when tested at a common temperature of 10°C (in terms of both Qmax and power output). Only minimal differences in cardiac function were seen between hearts stimulated with basal (5 nmol l−1) versus maximal (200 nmol l−1) levels of adrenaline, the effects of which were not temperature dependent. These results: (1) show that maximum performance of the isolated cod heart is not compromised by exposure to cold temperatures; and (2) support data from other studies, which show that, in contrast to salmonids, cod cardiac performance/myocardial contractility is not dependent upon humoral adrenergic stimulation."},{"title":"Light interference as a possible stressor altering HSP70 and its gene expression levels in brain and hepatic tissues of golden spiny mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/4034","abstract":"Light at night and light interference (LI) disrupt the natural light:dark cycle, causing alterations at physiological and molecular levels, partly by suppressing melatonin (MLT) secretion at night.

We assessed changes in gene expression and protein level of HSP70 in brain and hepatic tissues of golden spiny mice (Acomys russatus) acclimated to LI for two (SLI), seven (MLI) and 21 nights (LLI). The effect of MLT treatment on LI-mice was also assessed. HSP70 levels increased in brain and hepatic tissues after SLI, whereas after MLI and LLI, HSP70 decreased to control levels. Changes in HSP70 levels as a response to MLT occurred after SLI only in hepatic tissue. However, hsp70 expression following SLI increased in brain tissue, but not in hepatic tissue. MLT treatment and SLI caused a decrease in hsp70 levels in brain tissue and an increase in hsp70 in hepatic tissue. SLI acclimation elicited a stress response in A. russatus, as expressed by increased HSP70 levels and gene expression. Longer acclimation decreases protein and gene expression to their control levels. We conclude that for brain and hepatic tissues of A. russatus, LI is a short-term stressor. Our results also revealed that A. russatus can acclimate to LI, possibly because of its circadian system plasticity, which allows it to behave both as a nocturnal and as a diurnal rodent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the effect of LI as a stressor at the cellular level, by activating HSP70."},{"title":"King penguins adjust their diving behaviour with age","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3685","abstract":"Increasing experience in long-lived species is fundamental to improving breeding success and ultimately individual fitness. Diving efficiency of marine animals is primarily determined by their physiological and mechanical characteristics. This efficiency may be apparent via examination of biomechanical performance (e.g. stroke frequency and amplitude, change in buoyancy or body angle, etc.), which itself may be modulated according to resource availability, particularly as a function of depth. We investigated how foraging and diving abilities vary with age in a long-lived seabird. During two breeding seasons, small accelerometers were deployed on young (5 year old) and older (8/9 year old) brooding king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) at the Crozet Archipelago, Indian Ocean. We used partial dynamic body acceleration (PDBA) to quantify body movement during dive and estimate diving cost. During the initial part of the descent, older birds exerted more effort for a given speed but younger penguins worked harder in relation to performance at greater depths. Younger birds also worked harder per unit speed for virtually the whole of the ascent. We interpret these differences using a model that takes into account the upthrust and drag to which the birds are subjected during the dive. From this, we suggest that older birds inhale more at the surface but that an increase in the drag coefficient is the factor leading to the increased effort to swim at a given speed by the younger birds at greater depths. We propose that this higher drag may be the result of young birds adopting less hydrodynamic postures or less direct trajectories when swimming or even having a plumage in poorer condition."},{"title":"Fatiguing stimulation of one skeletal muscle triggers heat shock protein activation in several rat organs: the role of muscle innervation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/4041","abstract":"We hypothesised that activation of muscle afferents by fatigue triggers a widespread activation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in resting muscles and different organs.

One TA muscle was electrically stimulated and tissues were sampled 10 or 60 min after the stimulation had ended. The nerve supply to the stimulated TA or its counterpart in the contralateral limb was left intact or suppressed. In control rats, no muscle stimulation was performed and tissues were sampled at the same time points (10 or 60 min). After TA stimulation, ELISA showed an increased HSP25 content in the contralateral TA, EDL and diaphragm at 10 min but not at 60 min, and HSP70 increased in all sampled tissues at 60 min. Western blotting did not show any changes in HSP25 and HSP70 at 10 min, while at 60 min HSP25 increased in all sampled tissues except the brain and HSP70 was elevated in all tissues. Denervation of the contralateral non-stimulated limb suppressed HSP changes in TA and after denervation of the stimulated TA the widespread activation of HSPs in other organs was absent. Our data suggest that fatigue-induced activation of skeletal muscle afferents triggers an early increase in phosphorylated HSP25 in muscles and a delayed elevation of non-phosphorylated HSP25 and HSP70 in skeletal and respiratory muscles, kidney and brain."},{"title":"Ontogeny of aerodynamics in mallards: comparative performance and developmental implications","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3693","abstract":"Wing morphology correlates with flight performance and ecology among adult birds, yet the impact of wing development on aerodynamic capacity is not well understood. Recent work using chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar), a precocial flier, indicates that peak coefficients of lift and drag (CL and CD) and lift-to-drag ratio (CL:CD) increase throughout ontogeny and that these patterns correspond with changes in feather microstructure. To begin to place these results in a comparative context that includes variation in life-history strategy, we used a propeller and force-plate model to study aerodynamic force production across a developmental series of the altricial-flying mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). We observed the same trend in mallards as reported for chukar in that coefficients of vertical (CV) and horizontal force (CH) and CV:CH ratio increased with age, and that measures of gross-wing morphology (aspect ratio, camber and porosity) in mallards did not account for intraspecific trends in force production. Rather, feather microstructure (feather unfurling, rachis width, feather asymmetry and barbule overlap) all were positively correlated with peak CV:CH. Throughout ontogeny, mallard primary feathers became stiffer and less transmissive to air at both macroscale (between individual feathers) and microscale (between barbs/barbules/barbicels) levels. Differences between species were manifest primarily as heterochrony of aerodynamic force development. Chukar wings generated measurable aerodynamic forces early (<8 days), and improved gradually throughout a 100 day ontogenetic period. Mallard wings exhibited delayed aerodynamic force production until just prior to fledging (day 60), and showed dramatic improvement within a condensed 2-week period. These differences in timing may be related to mechanisms of escape used by juveniles, with mallards swimming to safety and chukar flap-running up slopes to take refuge. Future comparative work should test whether the need for early onset of aerodynamic force production in the chukar, compared with delayed, but rapid, change in the mallard wing, leads to a limited repertoire of flight behavior in adult chukar compared with mallards."},{"title":"Precocial hindlimbs and altricial forelimbs: partitioning ontogenetic strategies in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3703","abstract":"Precocial development, in which juveniles are relatively mature at hatching or birth, is more common among vertebrates than altricial development, and is likely to be the basal condition. Altricial development characterizes many birds and mammals and is generally viewed as an alternate strategy, promoting fast growth rates, short developmental periods and relatively poor locomotor performance prior to attaining adult size. Many aquatic birds such as Anseriformes (ducks, geese and swans), Charadriformes (gulls and terns) and Gruiformes (rails) undergo distinctive developmental trajectories, in that hatchlings are able to run and swim the day they hatch, yet they do not begin to fly until fully grown. We hypothesized that there should be tradeoffs in apportioning bone and muscle mass to the hindlimb and forelimb that could account for these patterns in locomotor behavior within the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Growth of the musculoskeletal system in the forelimbs and hindlimbs was measured and compared with maximal aquatic and terrestrial sprint speeds and aerial descent rates throughout the 2-month-long mallard ontogenetic period. At 30 days post hatching, when body mass is 50% of adult values, hindlimb muscle mass averages 90% and forelimb muscle mass averages 10% of adult values; similarly, bone growth (length and width) in the hindlimbs and forelimbs averages 90 and 60% of adult values, respectively. The attainment of mallard locomotor performance parallels the morphological maturation of forelimb and hindlimb morphometrics – hindlimb performance initiates just after hatching at a relatively high level (~50% adult values) and gradually improves throughout the first month of development, while forelimb performance is relatively non-existent at hatching (~10% adult values), experiencing delayed and dramatic improvement in function, and maturing at the time of fledging. This divergence in ontogenetic strategy between locomotor modules could allow developing Anseriformes to inhabit aquatic, predator-reduced refuges without relying on flight for juvenile escape. Furthermore, by freeing the forelimbs from locomotor demand early in ontogeny, Anseriformes may bypass the potential canalization (i.e. retention) of juvenile form present within their precocial hindlimbs, to dramatically depart in forelimb form and function in the adult."},{"title":"Task-dependent activity of motor unit populations in feline ankle extensor muscles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3711","abstract":"Understanding the functional significance of the morphological diversity of mammalian skeletal muscles is limited by technical difficulties of estimating the contribution of motor units with different properties to unconstrained motor behaviours. Recently developed wavelet and principal components analysis of intramuscular myoelectric signals has linked signals with lower and higher frequency contents to the use of slower and faster motor unit populations. In this study we estimated the relative contributions of lower and higher frequency signals of cat ankle extensors (soleus, medial and lateral gastrocnemii, plantaris) during level, downslope and upslope walking and the paw-shake response. This was done using the first two myoelectric signal principal components (PCI, PCII), explaining over 90% of the signal, and an angle θ, a function of PCI/PCII, indicating the relative contribution of slower and faster motor unit populations. Mean myoelectric frequencies in all walking conditions were lowest for slow soleus (234 Hz) and highest for fast gastrocnemii (307 and 330 Hz) muscles. Motor unit populations within and across the studied muscles that demonstrated lower myoelectric frequency (suggesting slower populations) were recruited during tasks and movement phases with lower mechanical demands on the ankle extensors – during downslope and level walking and in early walking stance and paw-shake phases. With increasing mechanical demands (upslope walking, mid-phase of paw-shake cycles), motor unit populations generating higher frequency signals (suggesting faster populations) contributed progressively more. We conclude that the myoelectric frequency contents within and between feline ankle extensors vary across studied motor behaviours, with patterns that are generally consistent with muscle fibre-type composition."},{"title":"The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis, excretes urea mainly through the mouth instead of the kidney","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3723","abstract":"The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis, is well adapted to aquatic environments, including brackish swamps and marshes. It is ureotelic, and occasionally submerges its head into puddles of water during emersion, presumably for buccopharyngeal respiration. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the buccophyaryngeal cavity constitutes an important excretory route for urea in P. sinensis. Results indicate that a major portion of urea was excreted through the mouth instead of the kidney during immersion. When restrained on land, P. sinensis occasionally submerged their head into water (20–100 min), during which urea excretion and oxygen extraction occurred simultaneously. These results indicate for the first time that buccopharyngeal villiform processes (BVP) and rhythmic pharyngeal movements were involved in urea excretion in P. sinensis. Urea excretion through the mouth was sensitive to phloretin inhibition, indicating the involvement of urea transporters (UTs). In addition, saliva samples collected from the buccopharyngeal surfaces of P. sinensis injected intraperitoneally with saline contained ~36 mmol N l−1 urea, significantly higher than that (~2.4 mmol N l−1) in the plasma. After intraperitoneal injection with 20 μmol urea g−1 turtle, the concentration of urea in the saliva collected from the BVP increased to an extraordinarily high level of ~614 μmol N ml−1, but the urea concentration (~45 μmol N ml−1) in the plasma was much lower, indicating that the buccopharyngeal epithelium of P. sinensis was capable of active urea transport. Subsequently, we obtained from the buccopharyngeal epithelium of P. sinensis the full cDNA sequence of a putative UT, whose deduced amino acid sequence had ~70% similarity with human and mouse UT-A2. This UT was not expressed in the kidney, corroborating the proposition that the kidney had only a minor role in urea excretion in P. sinensis. As UT-A2 is known to be a facilitative urea transporter, it is logical to deduce that it was localized in the basolateral membrane of the buccopharyngeal epithelium, and that another type of primary or secondary active urea transporter yet to be identified was present in the apical membrane. The ability to excrete urea through the mouth instead of the kidney might have facilitated the ability of P. sinensis and other soft-shelled turtles to successfully invade the brackish and/or marine environment."},{"title":"Intense flight and endotoxin injection elicit similar effects on leukocyte distributions but dissimilar effects on plasma-based immunological indices in pigeons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3734","abstract":"Most birds rely on flight for survival. Yet as an energetically taxing and physiologically integrative process, flight has many repercussions. Studying pigeons (Columba livia) and employing physiological and immunological indices that are relevant to ecologists working with wild birds, we determined what, if any, acute immune-like responses result from bouts of intense, non-migratory flight. We compared the effects of flight with the effects of a simulated bacterial infection. We also investigated indices in terms of their post-flight changes within individuals and their relationship with flight speed among individuals. Compared to un-flown controls, flown birds exhibited significant elevations in numbers of heterophils relative to numbers of lymphocytes and significant reductions in numbers of eosinophils and monocytes. Furthermore, within-individual changes in concentrations of an acute phase protein were greater in flown birds than in controls. However, none of the flight-affected indices showed any evidence of being related to flight speed. While some of the effects of flight were comparable to the effects of the simulated bacterial infection, other effects were observed only after one of these two physiological challenges. Our study suggests that flight by pigeons yields immune-like responses, and these responses have the potential to complicate the conclusions drawn by ecologists regarding immune function in free-living birds. Still, a better understanding of the repercussions of flight can help clarify the ties between the physiology of exercise and the disease ecology of migration and will ultimately assist in the broader goal of accounting for immunological variation within and among species."},{"title":"The sender–receiver matching hypothesis: support from the peripheral coding of acoustic features in songbirds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3742","abstract":"The sender–receiver matching hypothesis predicts that species-specific features of vocalizations will be reflected in species-specific auditory processing.

We explored this hypothesis in five songbird species that vary in the rise times and frequency range of their vocalizations. We recorded auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) to onset and sustained portions of stimuli that varied in both frequency and rise time. AEPs are gross potentials generated in the auditory nerve and brainstem and measured from the scalp. We found that species with shorter rise times in their vocalizations had greater amplitude and shorter latency onset AEPs than species with longer rise times. We also found that species with lower frequency and/or more tonal vocalizations had stronger sustained AEPs that follow the sound pressure changes in the stimulus (i.e. frequency following responses) than species with higher frequency and/or less tonal vocalizations. This is the first study in songbirds to show that acoustic features such as rise time and tonality are reflected in peripheral auditory processing."},{"title":"How does the blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena lunulata) flash its blue rings?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3752","abstract":"The blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena lunulata), one of the world's most venomous animals, has long captivated and endangered a large audience: children playing at the beach, divers turning over rocks, and biologists researching neurotoxins. These small animals spend much of their time in hiding, showing effective camouflage patterns. When disturbed, the octopus will flash around 60 iridescent blue rings and, when strongly harassed, bite and deliver a neurotoxin that can kill a human. Here, we describe the flashing mechanism and optical properties of these rings. The rings contain physiologically inert multilayer reflectors, arranged to reflect blue–green light in a broad viewing direction. Dark pigmented chromatophores are found beneath and around each ring to enhance contrast. No chromatophores are above the ring; this is unusual for cephalopods, which typically use chromatophores to cover or spectrally modify iridescence. The fast flashes are achieved using muscles under direct neural control. The ring is hidden by contraction of muscles above the iridophores; relaxation of these muscles and contraction of muscles outside the ring expose the iridescence. This mechanism of producing iridescent signals has not previously been reported in cephalopods and we suggest that it is an exceptionally effective way to create a fast and conspicuous warning display."},{"title":"Ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormone activates egg maturation in the mosquito Georgecraigius atropalpus after adult eclosion or a blood meal","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3758","abstract":"The rockpool mosquito, Georgecraigius atropalpus, is a facultatively autogenous species that produces its first egg clutch without a blood meal shortly after emergence. Several days after depositing this clutch, females must take a blood meal to produce a second egg clutch. Decapitation of females shortly after emergence or blood ingestion prevents egg maturation. Here, we report that a single injected dose of the neuropeptide ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormone (OEH) fully restored egg maturation in decapitated females in both circumstances. This neuropeptide and two insulin-like peptides (ILPs) are potent gonadotropins in the related yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. ILP3 was marginally restorative in decapitated G. atropalpus, and ILP4 had no effect. Egg maturation in non- and blood-fed G. atropalpus was dependent on the enzymatic mobilization of amino acids from stored protein or the blood meal for yolk protein (vitellogenin, VG) synthesis and uptake by oocytes. We further show that OEH stimulates serine protease activity in the fat body of newly eclosed females or in the midgut of blood-fed ones, and ecdysteroid hormone production by the ovaries of both females. In contrast, only 20-hydroxyecdysone stimulated VG synthesis in the fat body of non- and blood-fed females. Using RNA interference to knock down expression of the insulin receptor, we found that OEH still fully restored autogenous egg maturation. In summary, our results identify OEH as a primary regulator of egg maturation in both autogenous and blood-fed G. atropalpus females and suggest the shift from blood meal-dependent to blood meal-independent release of OEH is a key factor in the evolution of autogeny in this species."},{"title":"Mild desiccation rapidly increases freeze tolerance of the goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis: evidence for drought-induced rapid cold-hardening","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3768","abstract":"Overwintering insects may experience extreme cold and desiccation stress. Both freezing and desiccation require cells to tolerate osmotic challenge as solutes become concentrated in the hemolymph. Not surprisingly, physiological responses to low temperature and desiccation share common features and may confer cross-tolerance against these stresses. Freeze-tolerant larvae of the goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae), experience extremely dry and cold conditions in winter. To determine whether mild desiccation can improve freeze tolerance at organismal and cellular levels, we assessed survival, hemolymph osmolality and glycerol levels of control and desiccated larvae. Larvae that lost only 6–10% of their body mass, in as little as 6 h, had markedly higher levels of freeze tolerance. Mild, rapid desiccation increased freezing tolerance at −15°C in September-collected larvae (33.3±6.7 to 73.3±12%) and at −20°C in October-collected larvae (16.7±6.7 to 46.7±3.3%). Similarly, 6 h of desiccation improved in vivo survival by 17–43% in fat body, Malpighian tubule, salivary gland and tracheal cells at −20°C. Desiccation also enhanced intrinsic levels of cold tolerance in midgut cells frozen ex vivo (38.7±4.6 to 89.2±5.5%). Whereas hemolymph osmolality increased significantly with desiccation treatment from 544±16 to 720±26 mOsm, glycerol levels did not differ between control and desiccated groups. The rapidity with which a mild desiccation stress increased freeze tolerance closely resembles the rapid cold-hardening response, which occurs during brief sub-lethal chilling, and suggests that drought stress can induce rapid cold-hardening."},{"title":"Persistence of circannual rhythms under constant periodic and aperiodic light conditions: sex differences and relationship with the external environment","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3774","abstract":"The timing and duration of gonadal phases in the year indicates that breeding cycles are regulated by endogenous mechanisms. The present study on tropical spotted munia (Lonchura punctulata) investigates whether such mechanisms are based on circannual rhythms, and whether circannual rhythms between sexes differ in their relationship with the light environment. Birds were subjected to 12 h light per day (12L:12D), alternate days of light and darkness (24L:24D, LL/DD) and continuous light (LL), with L=22 lx and D≤1 lx, for 28 months at constant temperature (18±1°C). Groups kept on natural day lengths (NDL) served as controls. Measurement of body mass, gonads and molts of the primary wing feathers and body plumage at regular intervals showed that birds underwent repeated cycles in gonads and molt, but not in body mass. Under NDL, gonadal phases in both sexes cycled with 12 month periods. Under other conditions, males cycled with similar periods of ~11 months, but females cycled with relatively large period variations, ~10–13 months. Gonadal recrudescence–regression phase was longer in males than in females and, in both sexes, longer in the second year compared with the first year. The molt of wing primaries was more closely coupled to gonadal maturation in groups on NDL and 12L:12D than in groups on LL and LL/DD, but this relationship drifted apart in the second year. Body plumage molts were relatively more highly variable in both frequency and pattern in females than in males. It is suggested that annual breeding cycle in spotted munia is regulated by the self-sustained circannual rhythms, which probably interact with the annual photoperiodic cycle to synchronize breeding cycles to calendar year. Both sexes seem to have independent timing strategies, but females appear to share a greater role in defining the reproductive season in relation with the environment."},{"title":"Keeping momentum with a mouthful of water: behavior and kinematics of humpback whale lunge feeding","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3786","abstract":"Rorqual baleen whales lunge feed by engulfment of tons of prey-laden water in a large and expandable buccal pouch. According to prior interpretations, feeding rorquals are brought to a near-halt at the end of each lunge by drag forces primarily generated by the open mouth. Accelerating the body from a standstill is energetically costly and is purported to be the key factor determining oxygen consumption in lunge-feeding rorquals, explaining the shorter dive times than expected given their sizes. Here, we use multi-sensor archival tags (DTAGs) sampling at high rates in a fine-scale kinematic study of lunge feeding to examine the sequence of events within lunges and how energy may be expended and conserved in the process of prey capture. Analysis of 479 lunges from five humpback whales reveals that the whales accelerate as they acquire prey, opening their gape in synchrony with strong fluke strokes. The high forward speed (mean depth rate: 2.0±0.32 m s−1) during engulfment serves both to corral active prey and to expand the ventral margin of the buccal pouch and so maximize the engulfed water volume. Deceleration begins after mouth opening when the pouch nears full expansion and momentum starts to be transferred to the engulfed water. Lunge-feeding humpback whales time fluke strokes throughout the lunge to impart momentum to the engulfed water mass and so avoid a near or complete stop, but instead continue to glide at ~1–1.5 m s−1 after the lunge has ended. Subsequent filtration and prey handling appear to take an average of 46 s and are performed in parallel with re-positioning for the next lunge."},{"title":"Light-induced degeneration and microglial response in the retina of an epibenthonic pigmented teleost: age-dependent photoreceptor susceptibility to cell death","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3799","abstract":"Constant intense light causes apoptosis of photoreceptors in the retina of albino fish. However, very few studies have been performed on pigmented species. Tench (Tinca tinca) is a teleost inhabiting dimly lit environments that has a predominance of rods within the photoreceptor layer. To test the hypothesis that constant high intensity light can result in retinal damage in such pigmented epibenthonic teleost species, photodegeneration of the retina was investigated in the larvae and in juveniles of tench to assess whether any damage may also be dependent on fish age. We exposed both groups of animals to 5 days of constant darkness, followed by 4 days of constant 20,000 lx light, and then by 6 days of recovery in a 14 h light:10 h dark cycle. The results showed that the retina of the larvae group exhibited abundant photoreceptor cell apoptosis during the time of exposition to intense light, whereas that of juveniles was indifferent to it. Damaged retinas showed a strong TUNEL signal in photoreceptor nuclei, and occasionally a weak cytoplasmic TUNEL signal in Müller glia. Specific labelling of microglial cells with Griffonia simplicifolia lectin (GSL) histochemistry revealed that photoreceptor cell death alerts microglia in the degenerating retina, leading to local proliferation, migration towards the injured outer nuclear layer (ONL), and enhanced phagocytosis of photoreceptor debris. During the first days of intense light treatment, Müller cells phagocytosed dead photoreceptor cells but, once microglial cells became activated, there was a progressive increase in the phagocytic capacity of the microglia."},{"title":"The regulatory role of the NO/cGMP signal transduction cascade during larval attachment and metamorphosis of the barnacle Balanus (=Amphibalanus) amphitrite","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3813","abstract":"The barnacle Balanus amphitrite is among the most dominant fouling species on intertidal rocky shores in tropical and subtropical areas and is thus a target organism in antifouling research. After being released from adults, the swimming nauplius undertakes six molting cycles and then transforms into a cyprid. Using paired antennules, a competent cyprid actively explores and selects a suitable substratum for attachment and metamorphosis (collectively known as settlement). This selection process involves the reception of exogenous signals and subsequent endogenous signal transduction. To investigate the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic GMP (cGMP) during larval settlement of B. amphitrite, we examined the effects of an NO donor and an NO scavenger, two nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors and a soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor on settling cyprids. We found that the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) inhibited larval settlement in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, both the NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO and the NOS inhibitors aminoguanidine hemisulfate (AGH) and S-methylisothiourea sulfate (SMIS) significantly accelerated larval settlement. Suppression of the downstream guanylyl cyclase (GC) activity using a GC-selective inhibitor ODQ could also significantly accelerate larval settlement. Interestingly, the settlement inhibition effects of SNP could be attenuated by ODQ at all concentrations tested. In the developmental expression profiling of NOS and sGC, the lowest expression of both genes was detected in the cyprid stage, a crucial stage for the larval decision to attach and metamorphose. In summary, we concluded that NO regulates larval settlement via mediating downstream cGMP signaling."},{"title":"Flexibility in locomotor–feeding integration during prey capture in varanid lizards: effects of prey size and velocity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3823","abstract":"Feeding movements are adjusted in response to food properties, and this flexibility is essential for omnivorous predators as food properties vary routinely. In most lizards, prey capture is no longer considered to solely rely on the movements of the feeding structures (jaws, hyolingual apparatus) but instead is understood to require the integration of the feeding system with the locomotor system (i.e. coordination of movements). Here, we investigated flexibility in the coordination pattern between jaw, neck and forelimb movements in omnivorous varanid lizards feeding on four prey types varying in length and mobility: grasshoppers, live newborn mice, adult mice and dead adult mice. We tested for bivariate correlations between 3D locomotor and feeding kinematics, and compared the jaw–neck–forelimb coordination patterns across prey types. Our results reveal that locomotor–feeding integration is essential for the capture of evasive prey, and that different jaw–neck–forelimb coordination patterns are used to capture different prey types. Jaw–neck–forelimb coordination is indeed significantly altered by the length and speed of the prey, indicating that a similar coordination pattern can be finely tuned in response to prey stimuli. These results suggest feed-forward as well as feed-back modulation of the control of locomotor–feeding integration. As varanids are considered to be specialized in the capture of evasive prey (although they retain their ability to feed on a wide variety of prey items), flexibility in locomotor–feeding integration in response to prey mobility is proposed to be a key component in their dietary specialization."},{"title":"Prolactin regulates luminal bicarbonate secretion in the intestine of the sea bream (Sparus aurata L.)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3836","abstract":"The pituitary hormone prolactin is a pleiotropic endocrine factor that plays a major role in the regulation of ion balance in fish, with demonstrated actions mainly in the gills and kidney. The role of prolactin in intestinal ion transport remains little studied. In marine fish, which have high drinking rates, epithelial bicarbonate secretion in the intestine produces luminal carbonate aggregates believed to play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. The present study was designed to establish the putative role of prolactin in the regulation of intestinal bicarbonate secretion in a marine fish. Basolateral addition of prolactin to the anterior intestine of sea bream mounted in Ussing chambers caused a rapid (<20 min) decrease of bicarbonate secretion measured by pH-stat. A clear inhibitory dose–response curve was obtained, with a maximal inhibition of 60–65% of basal bicarbonate secretion. The threshold concentration of prolactin for a significant effect on bicarbonate secretion was 10 ng ml−1, which is comparable with putative plasma levels in seawater fish. The effect of prolactin on apical bicarbonate secretion was independent of the generation route for bicarbonate, as shown in a preparation devoid of basolateral HCO3−/CO2 buffer. Specific inhibitors of JAK2 (AG-490, 50 μmol l−1), PI3K (LY-294002, 75 μmol l−1) or MEK (U-012610, 10 μmol l−1) caused a 50–70% reduction in the effect of prolactin on bicarbonate secretion, and demonstrated the involvement of prolactin receptors. In addition to rapid effects, prolactin has actions at the genomic level. Incubation of intestinal explants of anterior intestine of the sea bream in vitro for 3 h demonstrated a specific effect of prolactin on the expression of the Slc4a4A Na+–HCO3− co-transporter, but not on the Slc26a6A or Slc26a3B Cl−/HCO3− exchanger. We propose a new role for prolactin in the regulation of bicarbonate secretion, an essential function for ion/water homeostasis in the intestine of marine fish."},{"title":"New insights from serranid fishes on the role of trade-offs in suction-feeding diversification","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3845","abstract":"Suction feeding is central to prey capture in the vast majority of ray-finned fishes and has been well studied from a detailed, mechanistic perspective. Several major trade-offs are thought to have shaped the diversification of suction-feeding morphology and behavior, and have become well established in the literature. We revisited several of these expectations in a study of prey capture morphology and kinematics in 30 species of serranid fishes, a large, ecologically variable group that exhibits diverse combinations of suction and forward locomotion. We find that: (1) diversity among species in the morphological potential to generate suction changes drastically across the range of attack speeds that species use, with all species that use high-speed attacks having low capacity to generate suction, whereas slow-speed attackers exhibit the full range of suction abilities (this pattern indicates a more complex ‘ram–suction continuum’ than previously recognized); (2) there is no trade-off between the mechanical advantage of the lower jaw opening lever and the speed of jaw depression, revealing that this simple interpretation of lever mechanics fails to predict kinematic diversity; (3) high-speed attackers show increased cranial excursions, potentially to compensate for a decrease in accuracy; (4) the amount of jaw protrusion is positively related to attack speed, but not suction capacity; and (5) a principal component analysis revealed three significant multivariate axes of kinematic variation among species. Two of the three axes were correlated with the morphological potential to generate suction, indicating important but complex relationships between kinematics and suction potential. These results are consistent with other recent studies that show that trade-offs derived from simple biomechanical models may be less of a constraint on the evolutionary diversification of fish feeding systems than previously thought."},{"title":"Solubility of nitrogen in marine mammal blubber depends on its lipid composition","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3856","abstract":"Understanding the solubility of nitrogen gas in tissues is a crucial aspect of diving physiology, especially for air-breathing tetrapods. Adipose tissue is of particular interest because of the high solubility of nitrogen in lipids. Surprisingly, nothing is known about nitrogen solubility in the blubber of any marine mammal. We tested the hypothesis that N2 solubility is dependent on the lipid composition of blubber; most blubber is composed of triacylglycerols, but some toothed whales deposit large amounts of waxes in blubber instead. The solubility of N2 in the blubber of 13 toothed whale species ranged from 0.062 to 0.107 ml N2 ml−1 oil. Blubber with high wax ester content had higher N2 solubility, observed in the beaked (Ziphiidae) and small sperm (Kogiidae) whales, animals that routinely make long, deep dives. We also measured nitrogen solubility in the specialized cranial acoustic fat bodies associated with echolocation in a Risso's dolphin; values (0.087 ml N2 ml−1 oil) were 16% higher here than in its blubber (0.074 ml N2 ml−1 oil). As the acoustic fats of all Odontocetes contain waxes, even if the blubber does not, these tissues may experience greater interaction with N2. These data have implications for our understanding and future modeling of diving physiology in Odontocetes, as our empirically derived values for nitrogen solubility in toothed whale adipose were up to 40% higher than the numbers traditionally assumed in marine mammal diving models."},{"title":"Morphological specialization influences nectar extraction efficiency of sympatric nectar-feeding bats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/22/3989","abstract":"Mammals frequently use nectar as a supplementary food, while a predominantly nectarivorous lifestyle with morphological specializations for this feeding mode is rare within the class. However, Neotropical flower-visiting bats largely depend on nectar resources and show distinct adaptations to a nectar diet. Glossophagine bats form local guilds of 2–6 species that may differ distinctly in skull morphology. It is still unknown how and to what extent this morphological diversity influences the efficiency of nectar extraction and hence resource partitioning within the local bat guild. As foraging behaviour is a key factor for niche partitioning of co-existing species, we compared nectar extraction behaviour and efficiency at different flower depths among sympatric bat species with different degrees of morphological specialization (Glossophaga soricina, Leptonycteris yerbabuenae and Musonycteris harrisoni). In flight cage experiments with artificial flowers, at deeper nectar levels all species showed a distinct decrease in the amount of nectar extracted per visit and an increase in the time spent hovering at the flower, indicating increased energetic cost when foraging on longer tubed flowers. The lowest nectar extraction efficiency (g s−1) was found in the small G. soricina and the highest in the largest species L. yerbabuenae. However, when also considering the different energy requirements of the different-sized bat species, the morphologically most specialized M. harrisoni consistently showed the highest foraging efficiency. Our data suggest that the long rostrum and tongue of the extremely specialized M. harrisoni are probably not evolved for monopolization of co-evolved deep flowers but for allowing efficient access to the broadest range of the local chiropterophilous flower resources."},{"title":"Aerobic scope and cardiovascular oxygen transport is not compromised at high temperatures in the toad Rhinella marina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3519","abstract":"Numerous recent studies convincingly correlate the upper thermal tolerance limit of aquatic ectothermic animals to reduced aerobic scope, and ascribe the decline in aerobic scope to failure of the cardiovascular system at high temperatures. In the present study we investigate whether this ‘aerobic scope model’ applies to an air-breathing and semi-terrestrial vertebrate Rhinella marina (formerly Bufo marinus). To quantify aerobic scope, we measured resting and maximal rate of oxygen consumption at temperatures ranging from 10 to 40°C. To include potential effects of acclimation, three groups of toads were acclimated chronically at 20, 25 and 30°C, respectively. The absolute difference between resting and maximal rate of oxygen consumption increased progressively with temperature and there was no significant decrease in aerobic scope, even at temperature immediately below the lethal limit (41–42°C). Haematological and cardiorespiratory variables were measured at rest and immediately after maximal activity at benign (30°C) and critically high (40°C) temperatures. Within this temperature interval, both resting and active heart rate increased, and there was no indication of respiratory failure, judged from high arterial oxygen saturation, PO2 and [HbO2]. With the exception of elevated resting metabolic rate for cold-acclimated toads, we found few differences in the thermal responses between acclimation groups with regard to the cardiometabolic parameters. In conclusion, we found no evidence for temperature-induced cardiorespiratory failure in R. marina, indicating that maintenance of aerobic scope and oxygen transport is unrelated to the upper thermal limit of this air-breathing semi-terrestrial vertebrate."},{"title":"Clock accuracy and precision evolve as a consequence of selection for adult emergence in a narrow window of time in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3527","abstract":"Although circadian clocks are believed to have evolved under the action of periodic selection pressures (selection on phasing) present in the geophysical environment, there is very little rigorous and systematic empirical evidence to support this. In the present study, we examined the effect of selection for adult emergence in a narrow window of time on the circadian rhythms of fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster. Selection was imposed in every generation by choosing flies that emerged during a 1 h window of time close to the emergence peak of baseline/control flies under 12 h:12 h light:dark cycles. To study the effect of selection on circadian clocks we estimated several quantifiable features that reflect inter- and intra-individual variance in adult emergence and locomotor activity rhythms. The results showed that with increasing generations, incidence of adult emergence and activity of adult flies during the 1 h selection window increased gradually in the selected populations. Flies from the selected populations were more homogenous in their clock period, were more coherent in their phase of entrainment, and displayed enhanced accuracy and precision in their emergence and activity rhythms compared with controls. These results thus suggest that circadian clocks in D. melanogaster evolve enhanced accuracy and precision when subjected to selection for emergence in a narrow window of time."},{"title":"Perception of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) by loggerhead sea turtles: a possible mechanism for locating high-productivity oceanic regions for foraging","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3535","abstract":"During their long-distance migrations, sea turtles of several species feed on jellyfish and other invertebrates that are particularly abundant in ocean regions characterized by high productivity. An ability to distinguish productive oceanic regions from other areas, and to concentrate foraging activities in locations where prey density is highest, might therefore be adaptive. The volatile compound dimethyl sulfide (DMS) accumulates in the air above productive ocean areas such as upwelling and frontal zones. In principle, DMS might therefore serve as an indicator of high prey density for turtles. To determine whether turtles perceive DMS, juvenile loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) were placed into a water-filled arena in which DMS and other odorants could be introduced to the air above the water surface. Turtles exposed to air that had passed over a cup containing 10 nmol l−1 DMS spent more time at the surface with their noses out of the water than control turtles, which were exposed to air that had passed over a cup containing distilled water. Odors that do not occur in the sea (cinnamon, jasmine and lemon) did not elicit increased surface time, implying that the response to DMS is unlikely to reflect a generalized response to any novel odor. The results demonstrate for the first time that sea turtles can detect DMS, an ability that might enable the identification of favorable foraging areas."},{"title":"Tendon material properties vary and are interdependent among turkey hindlimb muscles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3552","abstract":"The material properties of a tendon affect its ability to store and return elastic energy, resist damage, provide mechanical feedback and amplify or attenuate muscle power. While the structural properties of a tendon are known to respond to a variety of stimuli, the extent to which material properties vary among individual muscles remains unclear. We studied the tendons of six different muscles in the hindlimb of Eastern wild turkeys to determine whether there was variation in elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength and resilience. A hydraulic testing machine was used to measure tendon force during quasi-static lengthening, and a stress–strain curve was constructed. There was substantial variation in tendon material properties among different muscles. Average elastic modulus differed significantly between some tendons, and values for the six different tendons varied nearly twofold, from 829±140 to 1479±106 MPa. Tendons were stretched to failure, and the stress at failure, or ultimate tensile stress, was taken as a lower-limit estimate of tendon strength. Breaking tests for four of the tendons revealed significant variation in ultimate tensile stress, ranging from 66.83±14.34 to 112.37±9.39 MPa. Resilience, or the fraction of energy returned in cyclic length changes was generally high, and one of the four tendons tested was significantly different in resilience from the other tendons (range: 90.65±0.83 to 94.02±0.71%). An analysis of correlation between material properties revealed a positive relationship between ultimate tensile strength and elastic modulus (r2=0.79). Specifically, stiffer tendons were stronger, and we suggest that this correlation results from a constrained value of breaking strain, which did not vary significantly among tendons. This finding suggests an interdependence of material properties that may have a structural basis and may explain some adaptive responses observed in studies of tendon plasticity."},{"title":"On the ascent: the soleus operating length is conserved to the ascending limb of the force–length curve across gait mechanics in humans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3539","abstract":"The region over which skeletal muscles operate on their force–length (F–L) relationship is fundamental to the mechanics, control and economy of movement. Yet surprisingly little experimental data exist on normalized length operating ranges of muscle during human gait, or how they are modulated when mechanical demands (such as force output) change. Here we explored the soleus muscle (SOL) operating lengths experimentally in a group of healthy young adults by combining subject-specific F–L relationships with in vivo muscle imaging during gait. We tested whether modulation of operating lengths occurred between walking and running, two gaits that require different levels of force production and different muscle–tendon mechanics, and examined the relationship between optimal fascicle lengths (L0) and normalized operating lengths during these gaits. We found that the mean active muscle lengths reside predominantly on the ascending limbs of the F–L relationship in both gaits (walk, 0.70–0.94 L0; run, 0.65–0.99 L0). Furthermore, the mean normalized muscle length at the time of the peak activation of the muscle was the same between the two gaits (0.88 L0). The active operating lengths were conserved, despite a fundamentally different fascicle strain pattern between walking (stretch–shorten cycle) and running (near continuous shortening). Taken together, these findings indicate that the SOL operating length is highly conserved, despite gait-dependent differences in muscle–tendon dynamics, and appear to be preferentially selected for stable force production compared with optimal force output (although length-dependent force capacity is high when maximal forces are expected to occur). Individuals with shorter L0 undergo smaller absolute muscle excursions (P<0.05) so that the normalized length changes during walking and running remain independent of L0. The correlation between L0 and absolute length change was not explained on the basis of muscle moment arms or joint excursion, suggesting that regulation of muscle strain may occur via tendon stretch."},{"title":"Induced synthesis of P450 aromatase and 17β-estradiol by d-aspartate in frog brain","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3559","abstract":"d-Aspartic acid is an endogenous amino acid occurring in the endocrine glands as well as in the nervous system of various animal phyla. Our previous studies have provided evidence that d-aspartate plays a role in the induction of estradiol synthesis in gonads. Recently, we have also demonstrated that d-aspartic acid induces P450 aromatase mRNA expression in the frog (Pelophylax esculentus) testis. P450 aromatase is the key enzyme in the estrogen synthetic pathway and irreversibly converts testosterone into 17β-estradiol. In this study, we firstly investigated the immunolocalisation of P450 aromatase in the brain of P. esculentus, which has never previously been described in amphibians. Therefore, to test the hypothesis that d-aspartate mediates a local synthesis of P450 aromatase in the frog brain, we administered d-aspartate in vivo to male frogs and then assessed brain aromatase expression, sex hormone levels and sex hormone receptor expression. We found that d-aspartate enhances brain aromatase expression (mRNA and protein) through the CREB pathway. Then, P450 aromatase induces 17β-estradiol production from testosterone, with a consequent increase of its receptor. Therefore, the regulation of d-aspartate-mediated P450 aromatase expression could be an important step in the control of neuroendocrine regulation of the reproductive axis. Accordingly, we found that the sites of P450 aromatase immunoreactivity in the frog brain correspond to the areas known to be involved in neurosteroid synthesis."},{"title":"A flavonol present in cocoa [(−)epicatechin] enhances snail memory","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3566","abstract":"Dietary consumption of flavonoids (plant phytochemicals) may improve memory and neuro-cognitive performance, though the mechanism is poorly understood. Previous work has assessed cognitive effects in vertebrates; here we assess the suitability of Lymnaea stagnalis as an invertebrate model to elucidate the effects of flavonoids on cognition. (−)Epicatechin (epi) is a flavonoid present in cocoa, green tea and red wine. We studied its effects on basic snail behaviours (aerial respiration and locomotion), long-term memory (LTM) formation and memory extinction of operantly conditioned aerial respiratory behaviour. We found no significant effect of epi exposure (15 mg l−1) on either locomotion or aerial respiration. However, when snails were operantly conditioned in epi for a single 0.5 h training session, which typically results in memory lasting ~3 h, they formed LTM lasting at least 24 h. Snails exposed to epi also showed significantly increased resistance to extinction, consistent with the hypothesis that epi induces a more persistent LTM. Thus training in epi facilitates LTM formation and results in a more persistent and stronger memory. Previous work has indicated that memory-enhancing stressors (predator kairomones and KCl) act via sensory input from the osphradium and are dependent on a serotonergic (5-HT) signalling pathway. Here we found that the effects of epi on LTM were independent of osphradial input and 5-HT, demonstrating that an alternative mechanism of memory enhancement exists in L. stagnalis. Our data are consistent with the notion that dietary sources of epi can improve cognitive abilities, and that L. stagnalis is a suitable model with which to elucidate neuronal mechanisms."},{"title":"Electrophysiological evidence for polarization sensitivity in the camera-type eyes of the aquatic predacious insect larva Thermonectus marmoratus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3577","abstract":"Polarization sensitivity has most often been studied in mature insects, yet it is likely that larvae also make use of this visual modality. The aquatic larvae of the predacious diving beetle Thermonectus marmoratus are highly successful visually guided predators, with a UV-sensitive proximal retina that, according to its ultrastructure, has three distinct cell types with anatomical attributes that are consistent with polarization sensitivity. In the present study we used electrophysiological methods and single-cell staining to confirm polarization sensitivity in the proximal retinas of both principal eyes of these larvae. As expected from their microvillar orientation, cells of type T1 are most sensitive to vertically polarized light, while cells of type T2 are most sensitive to horizontally polarized light. In addition, T3 cells probably constitute a second population of cells that are most sensitive to light with vertical e-vector orientation, characterized by shallower polarization modulations, and smaller polarization sensitivity (PS) values than are typical for T1 cells. The level of PS values found in this study suggests that polarization sensitivity probably plays an important role in the visual system of these larvae. Based on their natural history and behavior, possible functions are: (1) finding water after hatching, (2) finding the shore before pupation, and (3) making prey more visible, by filtering out horizontally polarized haze, and/or using polarization features for prey detection."},{"title":"Dimiconin, a novel coagulation inhibitor from the kissing bug, Triatoma dimidiata, a vector of Chagas disease","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3597","abstract":"Sequence analysis of a Triatoma dimidiata salivary gland cDNA library resulted in the identification of two transcripts (Td60 and Td101) homologous to triabin, an inhibitor of thrombin in Triatoma pallidipennis saliva.

The resulting protein inhibited the intrinsic but not extrinsic blood coagulation pathway, suggesting that dimiconin is not a thrombin inhibitor. Measurement of the enzymatic activity of coagulation factors using chromogenic substrates revealed that dimiconin efficiently inhibited factor XIIa (FXIIa) activity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pre-incubation of dimiconin with FXII effectively inhibited FXIIa activity whereas dimiconin did not affect already activated FXIIa, indicating that dimiconin inhibits the activation of FXII but not the enzymatic activity of FXIIa.

We unexpectedly found that <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/215/20/3603/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/> in sustained backward flight is similar to that in forward flight at equivalent airspeed, and is about 20% lower than hovering <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/215/20/3603/embed/inline-graphic-3.gif\"/>. For a bird that was measured throughout a range of backward airspeeds up to a speed of 4.5 m s−1, the power curve resembled that of forward flight at equivalent airspeeds. Backward flight was facilitated by steep body angles coupled with substantial head flexion, and was also characterized by a higher wingbeat frequency, a flat stroke plane angle relative to horizontal, a high stroke plane angle relative to the longitudinal body axis, a high ratio of maximum:minimum wing positional angle, and a high upstroke:downstroke duration ratio. Because of the convergent evolution of hummingbird and some hexapod flight styles, flying insects may employ similar kinematics while engaged in backward flight, for example during station keeping or load lifting. We propose that backward flight behavior in retreat from flowers, together with other anatomical, physiological, morphological and behavioral adaptations, enables hummingbirds to maintain strictly aerial nectarivory."},{"title":"Jumping mechanisms in jumping plant lice (Hemiptera, Sternorrhyncha, Psyllidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3612","abstract":"Jumping mechanisms and performance were analysed in three species of psyllids (Hemiptera, Sternorrhyncha) that ranged from 2 to 4 mm in body length and from 0.7 to 2.8 mg in mass. Jumping was propelled by rapid movements of the short hind legs, which were only 10–20% longer than the other legs and 61–77% of body length. Power was provided by large thoracic muscles that depressed the trochantera so that the two hind legs moved in parallel planes on either side of the body. These movements accelerated the body to take-off in 0.9 ms in the smallest psyllid and 1.7 ms in the largest, but in all species imparted a rapid forward rotation so that at take-off the head pointed downwards, subtending angles of approximately −60 deg relative to the ground. The front legs thus supported the body just before take-off and either lost contact with the ground at the same time as, or even after, the hind legs. In the best jumps from the horizontal, take-off velocity reached 2.7 m s−1 and the trajectory was steep at 62–80 deg. Once airborne, the body spun rapidly at rates of up to 336 Hz in the pitch plane. In many jumps, the wings did not open to provide stabilisation, but some jumps led directly to sustained flight. In their best jumps, the smallest species experienced a force of 637 g. The largest species had an energy requirement of 13 μJ, a power output of 13 mW and exerted a force of nearly 10 mN. In a rare jumping strategy seen in only two of 211 jumps analysed, the femoro-tibial joints extended further and resulted in the head pointing upwards at take-off and the spin rate being greatly reduced."},{"title":"Sink fast and swim harder! Round-trip cost-of-transport for buoyant divers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3622","abstract":"Efficient locomotion between prey resources at depth and oxygen at the surface is crucial for breath-hold divers to maximize time spent in the foraging layer, and thereby net energy intake rates. The body density of divers, which changes with body condition, determines the apparent weight (buoyancy) of divers, which may affect round-trip cost-of-transport (COT) between the surface and depth. We evaluated alternative predictions from external-work and actuator-disc theory of how non-neutral buoyancy affects round-trip COT to depth, and the minimum COT speed for steady-state vertical transit. Not surprisingly, the models predict that one-way COT decreases (increases) when buoyancy aids (hinders) one-way transit. At extreme deviations from neutral buoyancy, gliding at terminal velocity is the minimum COT strategy in the direction aided by buoyancy. In the transit direction hindered by buoyancy, the external-work model predicted that minimum COT speeds would not change at greater deviations from neutral buoyancy, but minimum COT speeds were predicted to increase under the actuator disc model. As previously documented for grey seals, we found that vertical transit rates of 36 elephant seals increased in both directions as body density deviated from neutral buoyancy, indicating that actuator disc theory may more closely predict the power requirements of divers affected by gravity than an external work model. For both models, minor deviations from neutral buoyancy did not affect minimum COT speed or round-trip COT itself. However, at body-density extremes, both models predict that savings in the aided direction do not fully offset the increased COT imposed by the greater thrusting required in the hindered direction."},{"title":"Neuromuscular and biomechanical compensation for wing asymmetry in insect hovering flight","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3631","abstract":"Wing damage is common in flying insects and has been studied using a variety of approaches to assess its biomechanical and fitness consequences. Results of these studies range from strong to nil effect among the variety of species, fitness measurements and damage modes studied, suggesting that not all damage modes are equal and that insects may be well adapted to compensate for some types of damage. Here, we examine the biomechanical and neuromuscular means by which flying insects compensate for asymmetric wing damage, which is expected to produce asymmetric flight forces and torques and thus destabilize the animal in addition to reducing its total wing size. We measured the kinematic and neuromuscular responses of hawkmoths (Manduca sexta) hovering in free flight with asymmetrically damaged wings via high-speed videography and extracellular neuromuscular activity recordings. The animals responded to asymmetric wing damage with asymmetric changes to wing stroke amplitude sufficient to restore symmetry in lift production. These asymmetries in stroke amplitude were significantly correlated with bilateral asymmetries in the timing of activation of the dorsal ventral muscle among and within trials. Correspondingly, the magnitude of wing asymmetry was significantly, although non-linearly, correlated with the magnitude of the neuromuscular response among individuals. The strongly non-linear nature of the relationship suggests that active neural compensation for asymmetric wing damage may only be necessary above a threshold (>12% asymmetry in wing second moment of area in this case) below which passive mechanisms may be adequate to maintain flight stability."},{"title":"Locomotion analysis identifies roles of mechanosensory neurons in governing locomotion dynamics of C. elegans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3639","abstract":"The simple and well-characterized nervous system of C. elegans facilitates the analysis of mechanisms controlling behavior. Locomotion is a major behavioral output governed by multiple external and internal signals. Here, we examined the roles of low- and high-threshold mechanosensors in locomotion, using high-resolution and detailed analysis of locomotion and its dynamics. This analysis revealed a new role for touch receptor neurons in suppressing an intrinsic direction bias of locomotion. We also examined the response to noxious mechanical stimuli, which was found to involve several locomotion properties and to last several minutes. Effects on different locomotion properties have different half-lives and depend on different, partly overlapping sets of sensory neurons. PVD and FLP, high-threshold mechanosensors, play a major role in some of these responses. Overall, our results demonstrate the power of detailed, prolonged and high-resolution analysis of locomotion and locomotion dynamics in enabling better understanding of gene and neuron function."},{"title":"Magnetic compass orientation in two strictly subterranean rodents: learned or species-specific innate directional preference?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3649","abstract":"Evidence for magnetoreception in mammals remains limited. Magnetic compass orientation or magnetic alignment has been conclusively demonstrated in only a handful of mammalian species. The functional properties and underlying mechanisms have been most thoroughly characterized in Ansell's mole-rat, Fukomys anselli, which is the species of choice due to its spontaneous drive to construct nests in the southeastern sector of a circular arena using the magnetic field azimuth as the primary orientation cue. Because of the remarkable consistency between experiments, it is generally believed that this directional preference is innate. To test the hypothesis that spontaneous southeastern directional preference is a shared, ancestral feature of all African mole-rats (Bathyergidae, Rodentia), we employed the same arena assay to study magnetic orientation in two other mole-rat species, the social giant mole-rat, Fukomys mechowii, and the solitary silvery mole-rat, Heliophobius argenteocinereus. Both species exhibited spontaneous western directional preference and deflected their directional preference according to shifts in the direction of magnetic north, clearly indicating that they were deriving directional information from the magnetic field. Because all of the experiments were performed in total darkness, our results strongly suggest that all African mole-rats use a light-independent magnetic compass for near-space orientation. However, the spontaneous directional preference is not common and may be either innate (but species-specific) or learned. We propose an experiment that should be performed to distinguish between these two alternatives."},{"title":"Exposure to critical thermal maxima increases oxidative stress in hearts of white- but not red-blooded Antarctic notothenioid fishes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3655","abstract":"Antarctic icefishes have a significantly lower critical thermal maximum (CTmax) compared with most red-blooded notothenioid fishes. We hypothesized that the lower thermal tolerance of icefishes compared with red-blooded notothenioids may stem from a greater vulnerability to oxidative stress as temperature increases. Oxidative muscles of icefishes have high volume densities of mitochondria, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which can promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, icefishes have lower levels of antioxidants compared with red-blooded species. To test our hypothesis, we measured levels of oxidized proteins and lipids, and transcript levels and maximal activities of antioxidants in heart ventricle and oxidative pectoral adductor muscle of icefishes and red-blooded notothenioids held at 0°C and exposed to their CTmax. Levels of oxidized proteins and lipids increased in heart ventricle of some icefishes but not in red-blooded species in response to warming, and not in pectoral adductor muscle of any species. Thus, increases in oxidative damage in heart ventricles may contribute to the reduced thermal tolerance of icefishes. Despite an increase in oxidative damage in hearts of icefishes, neither transcript levels nor activities of antioxidants increased, nor did they increase in any tissue of any species in response to exposure to CTmax. Rather, transcript levels of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased in hearts of icefishes and the activity of SOD decreased in hearts of the red-blooded species Gobionotothen gibberifrons. These data suggest that notothenioids may have lost the ability to elevate levels of antioxidants in response to heat stress."},{"title":"Achilles tendon stiffness is unchanged one hour after a marathon","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3665","abstract":"Overuse-induced injuries have been proposed as a predisposing factor for Achilles tendon (AT) ruptures. If tendons can be overloaded, their mechanical properties should change during exercise. Because there data are lacking on the effects of a single bout of long-lasting exercise on AT mechanical properties, the present study measured AT stiffness before and after a marathon. AT stiffness was determined as the slope of the force–elongation curve between 10 and 80% of maximum voluntary force. AT force–elongation characteristics were measured in an ankle dynamometer using simultaneous motion-capture-assisted ultrasonography. Oxygen consumption and ankle kinematics were also measured on a treadmill at the marathon pace. All measurements were performed before and after the marathon. AT stiffness did not change significantly from the pre-race value of 197±62 N mm−1 (mean ± s.d.) to the post-race value of 206±59 N mm−1 (N=12, P=0.312). Oxygen consumption increased after the race by 7±10% (P<0.05) and ankle kinematic data revealed that in nine out of 12 subjects, the marathon induced a change in their foot strike technique. The AT of the physically active individuals seems to be able to resist mechanical changes under physiological stress. We therefore suggest that natural loading, like in running, may not overstress the AT or predispose it to injury. In addition, decreased running economy, as well as altered foot strike technique, was probably attributable to muscle fatigue."},{"title":"Correlates of prolonged swimming performance in F2 hybrids of migratory and non-migratory threespine stickleback","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3587","abstract":"Determining which underlying traits contribute to differences in whole-animal performance can be difficult when many traits differ between individuals with high and low capacities. We have previously found that migratory (anadromous marine) and non-migratory (stream-resident) threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) populations have genetically based differences in prolonged swimming performance (Ucrit) that are associated with divergence of a number of candidate morphological and physiological traits (pectoral fin size and shape, body shape, pectoral muscle and heart size, and pectoral muscle metabolic enzyme activities). Here, we use F2 hybrid crosses to determine which traits are correlated with Ucrit when expressed in a largely randomized genetic background and a range of trait values for other divergent traits. We found that four of our 12 candidate traits were positively correlated with Ucrit in F2 hybrids and that the combined effects of ventricle mass, pectoral adductor mass and adductor citrate synthase activity accounted for 17.9% of the variation in Ucrit. These data provide additional support for a causal role of muscle and heart size in mediating intraspecific differences in Ucrit, but indicate that many candidate morphological and biochemical traits do not have a strong effect on Ucrit when disassociated from other divergent traits. However, the limited variation in Ucrit in our F2 hybrid families may have decreased our ability to detect correlations among these candidate traits and Ucrit. These data suggest that many traits, interactions among traits and traits not measured in this study affect prolonged swimming performance in threespine stickleback."},{"title":"Inorganic nutrient availability affects organic matter fluxes and metabolic activity in the soft coral genus Xenia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/20/3672","abstract":"The release of organic matter (OM) by scleractinian corals represents a key physiological process that importantly contributes to coral reef ecosystem functioning, and is affected by inorganic nutrient availability. Although OM fluxes have been studied for several dominant reef taxa, no information is available for soft corals, one of the major benthic groups in tropical reef environments. Thus, this study investigates OM fluxes along with other key physiological parameters (i.e. photosynthesis, respiration and chlorophyll a tissue content) in the common soft coral genus Xenia after a 4-week exposure period to elevated ammonium (N; 20.0 μmol l−1), phosphate (P; 2.0 μmol l−1) and combined inorganic nutrient enrichment treatment (N+P). Corals maintained without nutrient enrichment served as non-treated controls and revealed constant uptake rates for particulate organic carbon (POC) (−0.315±0.161 mg POC m−2 coral surface area h−1), particulate nitrogen (PN) (−0.053±0.018 mg PN m−2 h−1) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (−4.8±2.1 mg DOC m−2 h−1). Although DOC uptake significantly increased in the N treatment, POC flux was not affected. The P treatment significantly enhanced PN release as well as photosynthesis and respiration rates, suggesting that autotrophic carbon acquisition of zooxanthellae endosymbionts influences OM fluxes by the coral host. Our physiological findings confirm the significant effect of inorganic nutrient availability on OM fluxes and key metabolic processes for the soft coral Xenia, and provide the first clues on OM cycles initiated by soft corals in reef environments exposed to ambient and elevated inorganic nutrient concentrations."},{"title":"Evidence that glucose is the major transferred metabolite in dinoflagellate–cnidarian symbiosis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3467","abstract":"Reef-building corals and many other cnidarians are symbiotic with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. It has long been known that the endosymbiotic algae transfer much of their photosynthetically fixed carbon to the host and that this can provide much of the host's total energy. However, it has remained unclear which metabolite(s) are directly translocated from the algae into the host tissue. We reexamined this question in the small sea anemone Aiptasia using labeling of intact animals in the light with 13C-bicarbonate, rapid homogenization and separation of animal and algal fractions, and analysis of metabolite labeling by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found labeled glucose in the animal fraction within 2 min of exposure to 13C-bicarbonate, whereas no significant labeling of other compounds was observed within the first 10 min. Although considerable previous evidence has suggested that glycerol might be a major translocated metabolite, we saw no significant labeling of glycerol within the first hour, and incubation of intact animals with 13C-labeled glycerol did not result in a rapid production of 13C-glucose. In contrast, when Symbiodinium cells freshly isolated from host tissue were exposed to light and 13C-bicarbonate in the presence of host homogenate, labeled glycerol, but not glucose, was detected in the medium. We also observed early production of labeled glucose, but not glycerol, in three coral species. Taken together, the results suggest that glucose is the major translocated metabolite in dinoflagellate–cnidarian symbiosis and that the release of glycerol from isolated algae may be part of a stress response."},{"title":"Edge detection depends on achromatic channel in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3478","abstract":"Edges represent important information in object recognition, and thus edge detection is crucial for animal survival. Various types of edges result from visual contrast, such as luminance contrast and color contrast. So far, the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying edge detection and the relationship between different edge information-processing pathways have been largely undemonstrated. In the present study, using a color light-emitting-diode-based Buridan's paradigm, we demonstrated that a blue/green demarcation is able to generate edge-orientation behavior in the adult fly. There is a blue/green intensity ratio, the so-called point of equal luminance, at which wild-type flies did not show obvious orientation behavior towards edges. This suggests that orientation behavior towards edges is dependent on luminance contrast in Drosophila. The results of mutants ninaE17 and sevLY3;rh52;rh61 demonstrated that achromatic R1–R6 photoreceptor cells, but not chromatic R7/R8 photoreceptor cells, were necessary for orientation behavior towards edges. Moreover, ectopic expression of rhodopsin 4 (Rh4), Rh5 or Rh6 could efficiently restore the edge-orientation defect in the ninaE17 mutant. Altogether, our results show that R1–R6 photoreceptor cells are both necessary and sufficient for orientation behavior towards edges in Drosophila."},{"title":"Visuo-motor transformations involved in the escape response to looming stimuli in the crab Neohelice (=Chasmagnathus) granulata","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3488","abstract":"Escape responses to directly approaching predators represent one instance of an animal's ability to avoid collision. Usually, such responses can be easily evoked in the laboratory using two-dimensional computer simulations of approaching objects, known as looming stimuli. Therefore, escape behaviors are considered useful models for the study of computations performed by the brain to efficiently transform visual information into organized motor patterns. The escape response of the crab Neohelice (previously Chasmagnathus) granulata offers an opportunity to investigate the processing of looming stimuli and its transformation into complex motor patterns. Here we studied the escape performance of this crab to a variety of different looming stimuli. The response always consisted of a vigorous run away from the stimulus. However, the moment at which it was initiated, as well as the developed speed, closely matched the expansion dynamics of each particular stimulus. Thus, we analyzed the response events as a function of several variables that could theoretically be used by the crab (angular size, angular velocity, etc.). Our main findings were that: (1) the decision to initiate the escape run is made when the stimulus angular size increases by 7 deg; (2) the escape run is not a ballistic kind of response, as its speed is adjusted concurrently with changes in the optical stimulus variables; and (3) the speed of the escape run can be faithfully described by a phenomenological input–output relationship based on the stimulus angular increment and the angular velocity of the stimulus."},{"title":"Locusts use a composite of resilin and hard cuticle as an energy store for jumping and kicking","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3501","abstract":"Locusts jump and kick by using a catapult mechanism in which energy is first stored and then rapidly released to extend the large hind legs. The power is produced by a slow contraction of large muscles in the hind femora that bend paired semi-lunar processes in the distal part of each femur and store half the energy needed for a kick. We now show that these energy storage devices are composites of hard cuticle and the rubber-like protein resilin. The inside surface of a semi-lunar process consists of a layer of resilin, particularly thick along an inwardly pointing ridge and tightly bonded to the external, black cuticle. From the outside, resilin is visible only as a distal and ventral triangular area that tapers proximally. High-speed imaging showed that the semi-lunar processes were bent in all three dimensions during the prolonged muscular contractions that precede a kick. To reproduce these bending movements, the extensor tibiae muscle was stimulated electrically in a pattern that mimicked the normal sequence of its fast motor spikes recorded in natural kicking. Externally visible resilin was compressed and wrinkled as a semi-lunar process was bent. It then sprung back to restore the semi-lunar process rapidly to its original natural shape. Each of the five nymphal stages jumped and kicked and had a similar distribution of resilin in their semi-lunar processes as adults; the resilin was shed with the cuticle at each moult. It is suggested that composite storage devices that combine the elastic properties of resilin with the stiffness of hard cuticle allow energy to be stored by bending hard cuticle over only a small distance and without fracturing. In this way all the stored energy is returned and the natural shape of the femur is restored rapidly so that a jump or kick can be repeated."},{"title":"The metabolic, locomotor and sex-dependent effects of elevated temperature on Trinidadian guppies: limited capacity for acclimation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3436","abstract":"Global warming poses a threat to many ectothermic organisms because of the harmful effects that elevated temperatures can have on resting metabolic rate (RMR) and body size. This study evaluated the thermal sensitivity of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) by describing the effects of developmental temperature on mass, burst speed and RMR, and investigated whether these tropical fish can developmentally acclimate to their thermal conditions. These traits were measured following exposure to one of three treatments: 70 days at 23, 25, 28 or 30°C (acclimated groups); 6 h at 23, 28 or 30°C following 70 days at 25°C (unacclimated groups); or 6 h at 25°C following 70 days in another 25°C tank (control group). Body mass was lower in warmer temperatures, particularly amongst females and individuals reared at 30°C. The burst speed of fish acclimated to each temperature did not differ and was marginally higher than that of unacclimated fish, indicative of complete compensation. Conversely, acclimated and unacclimated fish did not differ in their RMR at each temperature. Amongst the acclimated groups, RMR was significantly higher at 30°C, indicating that guppies may become thermally limited at this temperature as a result of less energy being available for growth, reproduction and locomotion. Like other tropical ectotherms, guppies appear to be unable to adjust their RMR through physiological acclimation and may consequently be susceptible to rising temperatures. Also, because larger females have higher fecundity, our data suggest that fecundity will be reduced in a warmer climate, potentially decreasing the viability of guppy populations."},{"title":"The proximal costs of case construction in caddisflies: antioxidant and life history responses","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3453","abstract":"Animal construction allows organisms to cope with environmental variations but the physiological costs of such behaviour are still poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to measure the physiological cost of construction behaviour through the oxidative balance that is known to affect the ability of organs to function, stimulates senescence processes and ultimately impacts the fitness of the organism. We used larvae of caddisfly, Limnephilus rhombicus, by experimentally modifying the effort associated with case building. Larvae that were forced to build a new case showed a significant increase in both total antioxidant capacity and the specific activity of superoxide dismutase 48 and 72 h, respectively, after the initiation of the reconstruction. These results strongly suggest that the larval construction behaviour triggered the production of reactive oxygen species, but their effects were reversed 7 days after the reconstruction. In the animals that were forced to build a new case, oxidative stress appeared to be mitigated by a network of antioxidant defences because no oxidative damage was observed in proteins compared with the control larvae. At the adult stage, while longevity was not sex dependent and was not affected by the treatment, body mass and body size of adult males from the reconstruction treatment were significantly lower than the control values. This unexpected sex effect together with data on oxidative stress highlights the difficulty of determining the physiological cost associated with energy-demanding behaviours, implying a consideration of both their energetic and non-energetic components is required."},{"title":"Oblique color vision in an open-habitat bird: spectral sensitivity, photoreceptor distribution and behavioral implications","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3442","abstract":"Color vision is not uniform across the retina because of differences in photoreceptor density and distribution. Retinal areas with a high density of cone photoreceptors may overlap with those with a high density of ganglion cells, increasing hue discrimination. However, there are some exceptions to this cell distribution pattern, particularly in species with horizontal visual streaks (bands of high ganglion cell density across the retina) that live in open habitats. We studied the spectral sensitivity and distribution of cone photoreceptors involved in chromatic and achromatic vision in the Canada goose (Branta canadiensis), which possesses an oblique rather than horizontal visual streak at the ganglion cell layer. Using microspectrophotometry, we found that the Canada goose has a violet-sensitive visual system with four visual pigments with absorbance peaks at 409, 458, 509 and 580 nm. The density of most cones involved in chromatic and achromatic vision peaked along a band across the retina that matched the oblique orientation of the visual streak. With the information on visual sensitivity, we calculated chromatic and achromatic contrasts of different goose plumage regions. The regions with the highest visual saliency (cheek, crown, neck and upper tail coverts) were the ones involved in visual displays to maintain flock cohesion. The Canada goose oblique visual streak is the retinal center for chromatic and achromatic vision, allowing individuals to sample the sky and the ground simultaneously or the horizon depending on head position. Overall, our results show that the Canada goose visual system has features that make it rather different from that of other vertebrates living in open habitats."},{"title":"Annual cycles of metabolic rate are genetically determined but can be shifted by phenotypic flexibility","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3459","abstract":"Birds have adjusted their life history and physiological traits to the characteristics of the seasonally changing environments they inhabit. Annual cycles in physiology can result from phenotypic flexibility or from variation in its genetic basis. A key physiological trait that shows seasonal variation is basal metabolic rate (BMR). We studied genetic and phenotypic variation in the annual cycles of body mass, BMR and mass-specific BMR in three stonechat subspecies (Saxicola torquata) originating from environments that differ in seasonality, and in two hybrid lines. Birds were kept in a common garden set-up, under annually variable day length and at constant temperature. We also studied whether stonechats use the proximate environmental factor temperature as a cue for changes in metabolic rate, by keeping birds at two different temperature regimes. We found that the different subspecies kept in a common environment had different annual cycles of body mass, BMR (variance: Kazakh 4.12, European 1.31, Kenyans 1.25) and mass-specific BMR (variance: Kazakh 0.042, European 0.003, Kenyans 0.013). Annual variation in metabolic measures of hybrids was intermediate or similar to that of parental species. Temperature treatment did not affect the shape of the annual cycles of metabolic rate, but metabolic rate was higher in birds kept under the variable temperature regime. The distinct annual cycles in body mass and metabolic rate in stonechat subspecies kept in a common environment indicate different genetic backgrounds rather than merely a phenotypically flexible response to proximate environmental cues. Phenotypic effects of temperature are superimposed on this genetically orchestrated annual cycle."},{"title":"Functional properties of myoglobins from five whale species with different diving capacities","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3403","abstract":"Whales show an exceptionally wide range of diving capabilities and many express high amounts of the O2 carrier protein myoglobin (Mb) in their muscle tissues, which increases their aerobic diving capacity. Although previous studies have mainly focused on the muscle Mb concentration and O2 carrying capacity as markers of diving behavior in whales, it still remains unexplored whether whale Mbs differ in their O2 affinities and nitrite reductase and peroxidase enzymatic activities, all functions that could contribute to differences in diving capacities. In this study, we have measured the functional properties of purified Mbs from five toothed whales and two baleen whales and have examined their correlation with average dive duration. Results showed that some variation in functional properties exists among whale Mbs, with toothed whale Mbs having higher O2 affinities and nitrite reductase activities (similar to those of horse Mb) compared with baleen whale Mbs. However, these differences did not correlate with average dive duration. Instead, a significant correlation was found between whale Mb concentration and average duration and depth of dives, and between O2 affinity and nitrite reductase activity when including horse Mb. Despite the fact that the functional properties showed little species-specific differences in vitro, they may still contribute to enhancing diving capacity as a result of the increased muscle Mb concentration found in extreme divers. In conclusion, Mb concentration rather than specific functional reactivities may support whale diving performance."},{"title":"Light and vision in the deep-sea benthos: I.

However, the extent of bioluminescence in benthic sites of similar depths is far less studied, although the relatively large eyes of benthic fish, crustaceans and cephalopods at bathyal depths suggest the presence of significant biogenic light. Using the Johnson-Sea-Link submersible, we collected numerous species of cnidarians, echinoderms, crustaceans, cephalopods and sponges, as well as one annelid from three sites in the northern Bahamas (500–1000 m depth). Using mechanical and chemical stimulation, we tested the collected species for light emission, and photographed and measured the spectra of the emitted light. In addition, in situ intensified video and still photos were taken of different benthic habitats. Surprisingly, bioluminescence in benthic animals at these sites was far less common than in mesopelagic animals from similar depths, with less than 20% of the collected species emitting light. Bioluminescent taxa comprised two species of anemone (Actinaria), a new genus and species of flabellate Parazoanthidae (formerly Gerardia sp.) (Zoanthidea), three sea pens (Pennatulacea), three bamboo corals (Alcyonacea), the chrysogorgiid coral Chrysogorgia desbonni (Alcyonacea), the caridean shrimp Parapandalus sp. and Heterocarpus ensifer (Decapoda), two holothuroids (Elasipodida and Aspidochirota) and the ophiuroid Ophiochiton ternispinus (Ophiurida). Except for the ophiuroid and the two shrimp, which emitted blue light (peak wavelengths 470 and 455 nm), all the species produced greener light than that measured in most mesopelagic taxa, with the emissions of the pennatulaceans being strongly shifted towards longer wavelengths. In situ observations suggested that bioluminescence associated with these sites was due primarily to light emitted by bioluminescent planktonic species as they struck filter feeders that extended into the water column."},{"title":"Light and vision in the deep-sea benthos: II.

Under blue chromatic adaptation, a secondary sensitivity peak in the UV portion of the spectrum appeared for two species of anomuran crabs: Eumunida picta (λmax 363 nm) and Gastroptychus spinifer (λmax 383 nm). Wavelength-specific differences in response waveforms under blue chromatic adaptation in these two species suggest that two populations of photoreceptor cells are present. Temporal resolution was determined in all eight species using the maximum critical flicker frequency (CFFmax). The CFFmax for the isopod Booralana tricarinata of 4 Hz proved to be the lowest ever measured using this technique, and suggests that this species is not able to track even slow-moving prey. Both the putative dual visual pigment system in the crabs and the extremely slow eye of the isopod may be adaptations for seeing bioluminescence in the benthic environment."},{"title":"The mechanical properties of the non-sticky spiral in Nephila orb webs (Araneae, Nephilidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3362","abstract":"Detailed information on web geometry and the material properties of the various silks used enables the function of the web’s different structures to be elucidated. In this study we investigated the non-sticky spiral in Nephila edulis webs, which in this species is not removed during web building. This permanent non-sticky spiral shows several modifications compared with others, e.g. temporary non-sticky spirals – it is zigzag shaped and wrapped around the radial thread at the elongated junctions. The material properties of the silk used in the non-sticky spiral and other scaffolding structures (i.e. radii, frame and anchor threads) were comparable. However, the fibre diameters differed, with the non-sticky spiral threads being significantly smaller. We used the measured data in a finite element (FE) model of the non-sticky spiral in a segment of the web. The FE analysis suggested that the observed zigzag index resulted from the application of very high pre-stresses to the outer turns of the non-sticky spiral. However, final pre-stress levels in the non-sticky spiral after reorganisation were down to 300MPa or 1.5–2 times the stress in the radii, which is probably closer to the stress applied by the spider during web building."},{"title":"Temperature compensation of aerobic capacity and performance in the Antarctic pteropod, Clione antarctica, compared with its northern congener, C. limacina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3370","abstract":"In ectotherms living in cold waters, locomotory performance is constrained by a slower generation of the ATP that is needed to fuel muscle contraction. Both polar and temperate pteropods of the genus Clione, however, are able to swim continuously by flapping their parapodia (wings) at comparable frequencies at their respective habitat temperatures. Therefore, we expected polar species to have increased aerobic capacities in their wing muscles when measured at common temperatures. We investigated muscle and mitochondrial ultrastructure of Clione antarctica from the Southern Ocean (−1.8°C) and populations of a sister species, Clione limacina, from the Arctic (−0.5 to 3°C) and from the North Atlantic (10°C). We also measured oxygen consumption and the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme citrate synthase (CS) in isolated wings of the two species. The Antarctic species showed a substantial up-regulation of the density of oxidative muscle fibers, but at the expense of fast-twitch muscle fibers. Mitochondrial capacity was also substantially increased in the Antarctic species, with the cristae surface density (58.2±1.3μm2μm−3) more than twice that found in temperate species (34.3±0.8μm2μm−3). Arctic C. limacina was intermediate between these two populations (43.7±0.5μm2μm−3). The values for cold-adapted populations are on par with those found in high-performance vertebrates. As a result of oxidative muscle proliferation, CS activity was 4-fold greater in C. antarctica wings than in temperate C. limacina when measured at a common temperature (20°C). Oxygen consumption of isolated wing preparations was comparable in the two species when measured at their respective habitat temperatures. These findings indicate complete compensation of ATP generation in wing muscles across a 10°C temperature range, which supports similar wing-beat frequencies during locomotion at each species' respective temperature. The elevated capacity in the wing muscles is reflected in the partial compensation of whole-animal oxygen consumption and feeding rates."},{"title":"Evidence for discrete landmark use by pigeons during homing","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3379","abstract":"Considerable efforts have been made to investigate how homing pigeons (Columba livia f. domestica) are able to return to their loft from distant, unfamiliar sites while the mechanisms underlying navigation in familiar territory have received less attention. With the recent advent of global positioning system (GPS) data loggers small enough to be carried by pigeons, the role of visual environmental features in guiding navigation over familiar areas is beginning to be understood, yet, surprisingly, we still know very little about whether homing pigeons can rely on discrete, visual landmarks to guide navigation. To assess a possible role of discrete, visual landmarks in navigation, homing pigeons were first trained to home from a site with four wind turbines as salient landmarks as well as from a control site without any distinctive, discrete landmark features. The GPS-recorded flight paths of the pigeons on the last training release were straighter and more similar among birds from the turbine site compared with those from the control site. The pigeons were then released from both sites following a clock-shift manipulation. Vanishing bearings from the turbine site continued to be homeward oriented as 13 of 14 pigeons returned home. By contrast, at the control site the vanishing bearings were deflected in the expected clock-shift direction and only 5 of 13 pigeons returned home. Taken together, our results offer the first strong evidence that discrete, visual landmarks are one source of spatial information homing pigeons can utilize to navigate when flying over a familiar area."},{"title":"Allometric scaling of discontinuous gas exchange patterns in the locust Locusta migratoria throughout ontogeny","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3388","abstract":"The discontinuous gas exchange cycle (DGC) is a three-phase breathing pattern displayed by many insects at rest. The pattern consists of an extended breath-hold period (closed phase), followed by a sequence of rapid gas exchange pulses (flutter phase), and then a period in which respiratory gases move freely between insect and environment (open phase). This study measured CO2 emission in resting locusts Locusta migratoria throughout ontogeny, in normoxia (21 kPa PO2), hypoxia (7 kPa PO2) and hyperoxia (40 kPa PO2), to determine whether body mass and ambient O2 affect DGC phase duration. In normoxia, mean CO2 production rate <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/215/19/3388/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/> scales with body mass (Mb; g) according to the allometric power equation <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/215/19/3388/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/>, closed phase duration (C; min) scales with body mass according to the equation C=8.0Mb0.38±0.29, closed+flutter period (C+F; min) scales with body mass according to the equation C+F=26.6M 0.20±0.25b and open phase duration (O; min) scales with body mass according to the equation O=13.3Mb 0.23±0.18. Hypoxia results in a shorter C phase and longer O phase across all life stages, whereas hyperoxia elicits shorter C, C+F and O phases across all life stages. The tendency for larger locusts to exhibit longer C and C+F phases might arise if the positive allometric scaling of locust tracheal volume prolongs the time taken to reach the minimum O2 and maximum CO2 set-points that determine the duration of these respective periods, whereas an increasingly protracted O phase could reflect the additional time required for larger locusts to expel CO2 through a relatively longer tracheal pathway. Observed changes in phase duration under hypoxia possibly serve to maximise O2 uptake from the environment, whereas the response of the DGC to hyperoxia is difficult to explain, but could be affected by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species."},{"title":"Functional morphology and bite performance of raptorial chelicerae of camel spiders (Solifugae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3411","abstract":"Solifugae are an understudied group of relatively large arachnids with well over 1000 species distributed on almost all major continents. These highly active predators utilize their large chelicerae for feeding, defense, burrowing and mating. We investigated the differences in cheliceral morphology and performance of two ecologically divergent species from North Africa; the cursorial Galeodes sp. and the burrowing Rhagodes melanus. Morphological data show differences in aspect ratio between the two species. Bite force measurements show Rhagodes (N=11) to be a much stronger biter than Galeodes (N=8), in terms of both absolute maximum force (Rhagodes 5.63 N, Galeodes 2.12 N) and force relative to cheliceral size. Synchrotron microtomographs of one specimen for each species reveal large differences in physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and estimated muscle stress, resulting in a much higher muscle stress in Rhagodes. This species also showed a longer muscle fiber length. Muscle volume and PCSA were found to differ between the two chelicerae in the two scanned specimens. Whereas Rhagodes reflects this morphological asymmetry in having a higher bite force in the right chelicera, Galeodes shows no such bias."},{"title":"Antimicrobial activity of alcohols from Musca domestica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3419","abstract":"Information on the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of cuticular alcohols on growth and virulence of insecticidal fungi is unavailable. Therefore, we set out to describe the content of cuticular and internal alcohols in the body of housefly larvae, pupae, males and females. The total cuticular alcohols in larvae, males and females of Musca domestica were detected in comparable amounts (4.59, 3.95 and 4.03 μg g−1 insect body, respectively), but occurred in smaller quantities in pupae (2.16 μg g−1). The major free alcohol in M. domestica larvae was C12:0 (70.4%). Internal alcohols of M. domestica larvae were not found. Among cuticular pupae alcohols, C12:0 (31.0%) was the most abundant. In the internal lipids of pupae, only five alcohols were identified in trace amounts. The most abundant alcohol in males was C24:0 (57.5%). The percentage content of cuticular C24:0 in males and females (57.5 and 36.5%, respectively) was significantly higher than that of cuticular lipids in larvae and pupae (0.9 and 5.6%, respectively). Only two alcohols were present in the internal lipids of males in trace amounts (C18:0 and C20:0). The most abundant cuticular alcohols in females were C24:0 (36.5%) and C12:0 (26.8%); only two alcohols (C18:0 and C20:0) were detected in comparable amounts in internal lipids (3.61±0.32 and 5.01±0.42 μg g−1, respectively). For isolated alcohols, antimicrobial activity against 10 reference strains of bacteria and fungi was determined. Individual alcohols showed approximately equal activity against fungal strains. C14:0 was effective against gram-positive bacteria, whereas gram-negative bacteria were resistant to all tested alcohols. Mixtures of alcohols found in cuticular lipids of larvae, pupae, males and females of M. domestica generally presented higher antimicrobial activity than individual alcohols. In contrast, crude extracts containing both cuticular and internal lipids showed no antifungal activity against the entomopathogenic fungus Conidiobolus coronatus, which efficiently kills adult house flies."},{"title":"Pressure and particle motion detection thresholds in fish: a re-examination of salient auditory cues in teleosts","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3429","abstract":"The auditory evoked potential technique has been used for the past 30 years to evaluate the hearing ability of fish. The resulting audiograms are typically presented in terms of sound pressure (dB re. 1 μPa) with the particle motion (dB re. 1 m s−2) component largely ignored until recently. When audiograms have been presented in terms of particle acceleration, one of two approaches has been used for stimulus characterisation: measuring the pressure gradient between two hydrophones or using accelerometers. With rare exceptions these values are presented from experiments using a speaker as the stimulus, thus making it impossible to truly separate the contribution of direct particle motion and pressure detection in the response. Here, we compared the particle acceleration and pressure auditory thresholds of three species of fish with differing hearing specialisations, goldfish (Carassius auratus, weberian ossicles), bigeye (Pempheris adspersus, ligamentous hearing specialisation) and a third species with no swim bladder, the common triplefin (Forstergyian lappillum), using three different methods of determining particle acceleration. In terms of particle acceleration, all three fish species have similar hearing thresholds, but when expressed as pressure thresholds goldfish are the most sensitive, followed by bigeye, with triplefin the least sensitive. It is suggested here that all fish have a similar ability to detect the particle motion component of the sound field and it is their ability to transduce the pressure component of the sound field to the inner ear via ancillary hearing structures that provides the differences in hearing ability. Therefore, care is needed in stimuli presentation and measurement when determining hearing ability of fish and when interpreting comparative hearing abilities between species."},{"title":"A test of alternative models for increased tissue nitrogen isotope ratios during fasting in hibernating arctic ground squirrels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3354","abstract":"We describe two models explaining the increase in tissue nitrogen isotope ratios (δ15N) that occurs during fasting in animals. The catabolic model posits that protein breakdown selectively removes the lighter isotope of nitrogen (14N) from catabolized tissues, causing an increase in the proportion of heavy nitrogen isotope (15N). The anabolic model posits that protein synthesis during fasting results in elevated δ15N values, as the unreplaced loss of 14N to urea results in a higher proportion of 15N in plasma amino acids used for protein synthesis. We effected a range of lean mass loss in arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii) fasting during hibernation and then collected organ and muscle tissues for analysis of δ15N values. The catabolic model predicts increased δ15N values in both liver and muscle, as these tissues undergo significant catabolism during hibernation. The anabolic model predicts no change in muscle, but an increase in δ15N values in liver, which has high levels of protein synthesis during euthermic phases of hibernation. We found a significant increase in liver δ15N values and no change in muscle δ15N values with lean mass loss, which supports the anabolic model. Heart, small intestine and brown adipose tissue also showed an increase in δ15N values, indicating protein synthesis in these organ tissues during hibernation. Urine was 3.8% lighter than plasma, and both urine and plasma increased in δ15N values with lean mass loss. This study helps clarify the mechanisms causing δ15N change during nutritional stress, thus increasing its utility for physiological research and reconciling previously contradictory results."},{"title":"The neural and peptidergic control of gut contraction in Locusta migratoria: the effect of an FGLa/AST","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/19/3394","abstract":"The regulation of insect gut physiology is complex and involves the interactions of a number of mechanisms, including the neural regulation of gut contraction by altering neural input and the modulation of gut contractions by neuropeptides directly affecting the muscle. The FGLa-type allatostatins (FGLa/ASTs) are known brain/gut peptides with numerous physiological roles, including modulation of gut contraction and neural input. To further investigate the pleiotropic roles of FGLa/AST peptides in Locusta migratoria, we have examined the role of a locust FGLa/AST (Scg-AST-6) in the gut. Proctolin and Scg-AST-6 have opposing effects on gut contraction, where proctolin dose-dependently increases gut muscle tension, while Scg-AST-6 inhibits both muscle tension and spontaneous and neurogenic contractions in a dose-dependent manner. Results from neurophysiological recordings indicate that there may be a central pattern generator (CPG) within the ventricular ganglia regulated by descending inhibition, and the addition of Scg-AST-6 dose-dependently modulates this ventricular ganglion CPG. This work provides a comprehensive picture of how FGLa/ASTs may modulate and coordinate each region of the locust gut, and shows that FGLa/ASTs have both central effects, on the ventricular ganglion CPG, and peripheral effects on the gut muscle. Overall, this study shows how FGLa/ASTs contribute to the complex regulation and fine tuning of gut contraction."},{"title":"Effects of temperature and cadmium exposure on the mitochondria of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) exposed to hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3142","abstract":"Intertidal bivalves are commonly exposed to multiple stressors including periodic hypoxia, temperature fluctuations and pollution, which can strongly affect energy metabolism. We used top-down control and elasticity analyses to determine the interactive effects of intermittent hypoxia, cadmium (Cd) exposure and acute temperature stress on mitochondria of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. Oysters were acclimated at 20°C for 30 days in the absence or presence of 50 μg l−1 Cd and then subjected to a long-term hypoxia (6 days at <0.5% O2 in seawater) followed by normoxic recovery. Mitochondrial function was assessed at the acclimation temperature (20°C), or at elevated temperature (30°C) mimicking acute temperature stress in the intertidal zone. In the absence of Cd or temperature stress, mitochondria of oysters showed high resilience to transient hypoxia. In control oysters at 20°C, hypoxia/reoxygenation induced elevated flux capacity of all three studied mitochondrial subsystems (substrate oxidation, phosphorylation and proton leak) and resulted in a mild depolarization of resting mitochondria. Elevated proton conductance and enhanced capacity of phosphorylation and substrate oxidation subsystems may confer resistance to hypoxia/reoxygenation stress in oyster mitochondria by alleviating production of reactive oxygen species and maintaining high aerobic capacity and ATP synthesis rates during recovery. Exposure to environmental stressors such as Cd and elevated temperatures abolished the putative adaptive responses of the substrate oxidation and phosphorylation subsystems, and strongly enhanced proton leak in mitochondria of oysters subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation stress. Our findings suggest that Cd exposure and acute temperature stress may lead to the loss of mitochondrial resistance to hypoxia and reoxygenation and thus potentially affect the ability of oysters to survive periodic oxygen deprivation in coastal and estuarine habitats."},{"title":"Locomotion and behavior of Humboldt squid, Dosidicus gigas, in relation to natural hypoxia in the Gulf of California, Mexico","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3175","abstract":"We studied the locomotion and behavior of Dosidicus gigas using pop-up archival transmitting (PAT) tags to record environmental parameters (depth, temperature and light) and an animal-borne video package (AVP) to log these parameters plus acceleration along three axes and record forward-directed video under natural lighting. A basic cycle of locomotor behavior in D. gigas involves an active climb of a few meters followed by a passive (with respect to jetting) downward glide carried out in a fins-first direction. Temporal summation of such climb-and-glide events underlies a rich assortment of vertical movements that can reach vertical velocities of 3 m s−1. In contrast to such rapid movements, D. gigas spends more than 80% of total time gliding at a vertical velocity of essentially zero (53% at 0±0.05 m s−1) or sinking very slowly (28% at −0.05 to −0.15 m s−1). The vertical distribution of squid was compared with physical features of the local water column (temperature, oxygen and light). Oxygen concentrations of ≤20 μmol kg−1, characteristic of the midwater oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), can influence the daytime depth of squid, but this depends on location and season, and squid can ‘decouple’ from this environmental feature. Light is also an important factor in determining daytime depth, and temperature can limit nighttime depth. Vertical velocities were compared over specific depth ranges characterized by large differences in dissolved oxygen. Velocities were generally reduced under OMZ conditions, with faster jetting being most strongly affected. These data are discussed in terms of increased efficiency of climb-and-glide swimming and the potential for foraging at hypoxic depths."},{"title":"Effect of dietary restriction on metabolic, anatomic and molecular traits in mice depends on the initial level of basal metabolic rate","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3191","abstract":"Dietary restriction (DR)-related delay of ageing is hypothesized to be mediated by the reduction of the metabolic rate (MR). However, studies on the effect of DR on MR have produced equivocal results. We demonstrated that this lack of congruency can be due to a variation in the initial level of MR within a given pool of experimental subjects. We subjected laboratory mice from two line types divergently selected for basal MR (BMR) to 30% DR lasting 6 months to test whether the effect of DR depends on the initial variation in BMR and peak MR. BMR and peak MR were independently affected by DR. The effect of DR was stronger in line types with higher initial levels of MR. Line-type-specific changes in the proportions of body components explained contrasting effects of DR on the mass-corrected BMR, which decreased in the high-BMR line type and did not change in the low-BMR line type. We conclude that the initial variation in MR can significantly affect response to DR. However, we found no association between the level of MR and mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to or protection against oxidative stress."},{"title":"The lizard celestial compass detects linearly polarized light in the blue","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3200","abstract":"The present study first examined whether ruin lizards, Podarcis sicula, are able to orientate using plane-polarized light produced by an LCD screen. Ruin lizards were trained and tested indoors, inside a hexagonal Morris water maze positioned under an LCD screen producing white polarized light with a single E-vector, which provided an axial cue. White polarized light did not include wavelengths in the UV. Lizards orientated correctly either when tested with E-vector parallel to the training axis or after 90 deg rotation of the E-vector direction, thus validating the apparatus. Further experiments examined whether there is a preferential region of the light spectrum to perceive the E-vector direction of polarized light. For this purpose, lizards reaching learning criteria under white polarized light were subdivided into four experimental groups. Each group was tested for orientation under a different spectrum of plane-polarized light (red, green, cyan and blue) with equalized photon flux density. Lizards tested under blue polarized light orientated correctly, whereas lizards tested under red polarized light were completely disoriented. Green polarized light was barely discernible by lizards, and thus insufficient for a correct functioning of their compass. When exposed to cyan polarized light, lizard orientation performances were optimal, indistinguishable from lizards detecting blue polarized light. Overall, the present results demonstrate that perception of linear polarization in the blue is necessary – and sufficient – for a proper functioning of the sky polarization compass of ruin lizards. This may be adaptively important, as detection of polarized light in the blue improves functioning of the polarization compass under cloudy skies, i.e. when the alternative celestial compass based on detection of the sun disk is rendered useless because the sun is obscured by clouds."},{"title":"What counts for ants? How return behaviour and food search of Cataglyphis ants are modified by variations in food quantity and experience","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3218","abstract":"When finding more food than one is able to carry home, should one come back to the site to exploit it further? This question is crucial for central place foragers that provide for a home place with brood or nest mates. The benefit of returning has to be weighed against the chance of finding food elsewhere and the resources available. Desert ants Cataglyphis fortis are well-studied examples when it comes to navigating back and forth between their nest and a foraging area, due to their primary reliance on path integration in the open and featureless desert habitat. The ants use path integration not only for a safe return from their foraging trips but also for future returns to plentiful feeding sites. The direction from the nest that has previously yielded food items is preferred for future foraging trips, a phenomenon termed sector fidelity. What prompts the ants to return to a particular site, and how faithfully they search for that place, has not been well studied. We examine the evaluation of food sources in channel experiments by varying both the number of food items in a feeder and the number of visits to the feeder before testing search distances of foragers returning to the feeding site. Ants exhibited more focused searches for plentiful food sources than for sources with only few food items upon their first return visit. After several successful visits, the ants always searched thoroughly for the food source, independent of the amount of food offered. Thus, desert ants consider both food abundance and reliability of food encounter, with corroborative learning of reliability gradually overriding the initial preference for plentiful feeders. The density of food items appears to be used by the ants as a proxy for food abundance. On the level of our analysis, the searches performed in the experimental channels are indistinguishable from those performed in the open desert terrain. The present results not only demonstrate how otherwise well-studied desert ants assess yield and experience with reliability of food sources, but also establish a model system for future study of how itemised food sources are exploited."},{"title":"The high aerobic capacity of a small, marsupial rat-kangaroo (Bettongia penicillata) is matched by the mitochondrial and capillary morphology of its skeletal muscles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3223","abstract":"We examined the structure–function relationships that underlie the aerobic capacities of marsupial mammals that hop. Marsupials have relatively low basal metabolic rates (BMR) and historically were seen as ‘low energy’ mammals. However, the red kangaroo, Macropus rufus (family Macropodidae), has aerobic capacities equivalent to athletic placentals. It has an extreme aerobic scope (fAS) and its large locomotor muscles feature high mitochondrial and capillary volumes. M. rufus belongs to a modern group of kangaroos and its high fAS is not general for marsupials. However, other hopping marsupials may have elevated aerobic capacities. Bettongia penicillata, a rat-kangaroo (family Potoroidae), is a small (1 kg), active hopper whose fAS is somewhat elevated. We examined the oxygen delivery system in its muscles to ascertain links with hopping. An elevated fAS of 23 provided a relatively high maximal aerobic oxygen consumption (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/215/18/3223/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>) in B. penicillata; associated with this is a skeletal muscle mass of 44% of body mass. Ten muscles were sampled to estimate the total mitochondrial and capillary volume of the locomotor muscles. Values in B. penicillata were similar to those in M. rufus and in athletic placentals. This small hopper had high muscle mitochondrial volume densities (7.1–11.9%) and both a large total capillary volume (6 ml kg−1 body mass) and total capillary erythrocyte volume (3.2 ml kg−1). Apparently, a considerable aerobic capacity is required to achieve the benefits of the extended stride in fast hopping. Of note, the ratio of <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/215/18/3223/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/> to total muscle mitochondrial volume in B. penicillata was 4.9 ml O2 min−1 ml−1. Similar values occur in M. rufus and also placental mammals generally, not only athletic species. If such relationships occur in other marsupials, a fundamental structure–function relationship for oxygen delivery to muscles likely originated with or before the earliest mammals."},{"title":"Developmental stress has sex-specific effects on nestling growth and adult metabolic rates but no effect on adult body size or body composition in song sparrows","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3207","abstract":"Variation in the prenatal and postnatal environments can have long-term effects on adult phenotype. In humans and other animals, exposure to stressors can lead to long-term changes in physiology. These changes may predispose individuals to disease, especially disorders involving energy metabolism. In addition, by permanently altering metabolic rates and energy requirements, such effects could have important fitness consequences. We determined the effects of early-life food restriction and corticosterone (CORT) treatment on growth and adult body size, body composition (assessed via quantitative magnetic resonance) and metabolic rates in the song sparrow, Melospiza melodia. Nestlings were hand-raised in captivity from 3 days of age. Treatments (ad libitum food, food restriction or CORT treatment) lasted from day 7 to day 60. Both experimental treatments had sex-specific effects on growth. In the nestling period, CORT-treated males weighed more than controls, whereas CORT-treated females weighed less than controls. Food-restricted males weighed the same as controls, whereas food-restricted females weighed less than controls. Both experimental treatments also had sex-specific effects on standard metabolic rate (SMR). Females exposed to food restriction or CORT treatment during development had higher SMRs in adulthood than control females, but neither stressor affected SMR in males. There were no effects of either treatment on adult body size, body composition (lean or fat mass) or peak metabolic rate. Therefore, early-life stress may have sex-specific programming effects on metabolic rates and energy expenditure in song sparrows. In addition, both treatments affected nestling growth in a manner that exaggerated the typical sex difference in nestling mass, which could provide male nestlings with a competitive advantage over their sisters when developing in a poor-quality environment."},{"title":"Rajiform locomotion: three-dimensional kinematics of the pectoral fin surface during swimming in the freshwater stingray Potamotrygon orbignyi","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3231","abstract":"Rajiform locomotion in fishes is dominated by distinctive undulations of expanded pectoral fins. Unlike other fishes, which typically interact with the fluid environment via multiple fins, undulating rays modulate a single control surface, the pectoral disc, to perform pelagic locomotion, maneuvering and other behaviors. Complex deformations of the broad, flexible pectoral fins occur as the undulating wave varies in three dimensions; pectoral fin kinematics and changes in waveform with swimming speed cannot be fully quantified by two-dimensional analyses of the fin margin. We present the first three-dimensional analysis of undulatory rajiform locomotion in a batoid, the freshwater stingray Potamotrygon orbignyi. Using three cameras (250 frames s−1), we gathered three-dimensional excursion data from 31 points on the pectoral fin during swimming at 1.5 and 2.5 disc lengths s−1, describing the propulsive wave and contrasting waveforms between swimming speeds. Only a relatively small region of the pectoral fin (~25%) undulates with significant amplitude (>0.5 cm). Stingrays can maintain extreme lateral curvature of the distal fin margin in opposition to induced hydrodynamic loads, ‘cupping’ the edge of the pectoral fin into the flow, with potential implications for drag reduction. Wave amplitude increases across both anteroposterior and mediolateral fin axes. Along the anteroposterior axis, amplitude increases until the wave reaches mid-disc and then remains constant, in contrast to angulliform patterns of continuous amplitude increase. Increases in swimming speed are driven by both wave frequency and wavespeed, though multivariate analyses reveal a secondary role for amplitude."},{"title":"Seasonal variation in energy expenditure is not related to activity level or water temperature in a large diving bird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3161","abstract":"There is considerable interest in understanding how the energy budget of an endotherm is modulated from a physiological and ecological point of view. In this paper, we used daily (24 h) heart rate (fH24), as a proxy of daily energy expenditure (DEE) across seasons, to test the effect of locomotion activity and water temperature on the energy budget of a large diving bird. fH24 was monitored continuously in common eiders (Somateria mollissima) during 7 months together with measures of time spent flying and time spent feeding. fH24 varied substantially during the recording period, with numerous increases and decreases that occurred across seasons, although we did not find any relationship between fH24 and the time spent active (feeding and flying). However, inactive heart rate (fH,inactive) decreased as locomotion activity increased, suggesting that common eiders were using some form of compensation when under a high work load. We were also unable to detect a negative relationship between water temperature and resting heart rate, a proxy of resting metabolic rate. This was unexpected, based on the assumption that high thermoregulation costs would be associated with cold waters. We showed instead that a high level of energy expenditure coincided with feather moult and warm waters, which suggests that the observed variable pattern of seasonal DEE was driven by these two factors. Nevertheless, our results indicate that compensation and possibly the timing of moult may be used as mechanisms to reduce seasonal variation in energy expenditure."},{"title":"Ammonia excretion in the freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3242","abstract":"In aquatic invertebrates, metabolic nitrogenous waste is excreted predominately as ammonia. Very little is known, however, of the underlying mechanisms of ammonia excretion, particularly in freshwater species. Our results indicate that in the non-parasitic freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, ammonia excretion depends on acidification of the apical unstirred layer of the body surface and consequent ammonia trapping. Buffering of the environment to a pH of 7 or higher decreased the excretion rate. Inhibitor experiments suggested further that the excretion mechanism involves the participation of the V-type H+-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase and possibly also the Na+/K+-ATPase and Na+/H+ exchangers. Alkalinization (pH 8.5, 2 days) of the environment led to a 1.9-fold increase in body ammonia levels and to a downregulation of V-ATPase (subunit A) and Rh-protein mRNA. Further, a 2 day exposure to non-lethal ammonia concentrations (1 mmol l−1) caused a doubling of body ammonia levels and led to an increase in Rh-protein and Na+/K+-ATPase (α-subunit) mRNA expression levels. In situ hybridization studies indicated a strong mRNA expression of the Rh-protein in the epidermal epithelium. The ammonia excretion mechanism proposed for S. mediterranea reveals striking similarities to the current model suggested to function in the gills of freshwater fish."},{"title":"A stingless bee can use visual odometry to estimate both height and distance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3155","abstract":"Bees move and forage within three dimensions and rely heavily on vision for navigation. The use of vision-based odometry has been studied extensively in horizontal distance measurement, but not vertical distance measurement. The honey bee Apis mellifera and the stingless bee Melipona seminigra measure distance visually using optic flow–movement of images as they pass across the retina. The honey bees gauge height using image motion in the ventral visual field. The stingless bees forage at different tropical forest canopy levels, ranging up to 40 m at our site. Thus, estimating height would be advantageous. We provide the first evidence that the stingless bee Melipona panamica utilizes optic flow information to gauge not only distance traveled but also height above ground, by processing information primarily from the lateral visual field. After training bees to forage at a set height in a vertical tunnel lined with black and white stripes, we observed foragers that explored a new tunnel with no feeder. In a new tunnel, bees searched at the same height they were trained to. In a narrower tunnel, bees experienced more image motion and significantly lowered their search height. In a wider tunnel, bees experienced less image motion and searched at significantly greater heights. In a tunnel without optic cues, bees were disoriented and searched at random heights. A horizontal tunnel testing these variables similarly affected foraging, but bees exhibited less precision (greater variance in search positions). Accurately gauging flight height above ground may be crucial for this species and others that compete for resources located at heights ranging from ground level to the high tropical forest canopies."},{"title":"Vector-based and landmark-guided navigation in desert ants of the same species inhabiting landmark-free and landmark-rich environments","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3169","abstract":"The central Australian desert ant Melophorus bagoti lives in a visually cluttered semi-arid habitat dotted with grass tussocks, bushes and trees. Previously, it was shown that this species has a higher propensity to switch from vector-based navigation to landmark-guided navigation compared with the North African desert ant Cataglyphis fortis, which usually inhabits a visually bare habitat. Here, we asked whether different colonies of M. bagoti, inhabiting more and less cluttered habitats, show a similar difference. We compared ants from typically cluttered habitats with ants from an exceptional nest located in an open field largely devoid of vegetation. Ants from both kinds of nests were trained to forage from a feeder and were then displaced to a distant test site on the open field. Under these conditions, ants from cluttered habitats switched more readily from vector-based navigation to landmark-guided navigation than ants from the open field. Thus, intraspecific differences caused by the experience of particular landmarks encountered en route, or of particular habitats, influence navigational strategies in addition to previously found interspecific, inherited differences due to the evolutionary history of living in particular habitats."},{"title":"The active electrosensory range of Gymnotus omarorum","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3266","abstract":"This article reports a biophysical and behavioral assessment of the active electrolocation range of Gymnotus omarorum. Physical measurements show that the stimulus field of a point on the sensory mosaic (i.e. the potential positions in which an object may cause a significant departure of the transcutaneous field from basal in the absence of an object) consists of relatively extended volumes surrounding this point. The shape of this stimulus field is dependent on the position of the point on the receptive mosaic and the size of the object. Although the limit of stimulus fields is difficult to assess (it depends on receptor threshold), departure from the basal field decays rapidly, vanishing at about 1.5 diameters for conductive spheres. This short range was predictable from earlier theoretical constructs and experimental data. Here, we addressed the contribution of three different but synergetic mechanisms by which electrosensory signals attenuate with object distance. Using novelty responses as an indicator of object detection we confirmed that the active electrosensory detection range is very short. Behavioral data also indicate that the ability to precisely locate a small object of edible size decays even more rapidly than the ability to detect it. The role of active electroreception is discussed in the context of the fish's habitat."},{"title":"Systematic functional characterization of putative zinc transport genes and identification of zinc toxicosis phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3254","abstract":"The heavy metal zinc is an essential component of the human diet and is incorporated as a structural component in up to 10% of all mammalian proteins. The physiological importance of zinc homeostasis at the cellular level and the molecular mechanisms involved in this process have become topics of increasing interest in recent years. We have performed a systematic functional characterization of the majority of the predicted Drosophila Zip (zinc/iron regulated transporter-related protein) and ZnT genes, using the Gal4-UAS system to carry out both ubiquitous and targeted over-expression and suppression studies for 13 of the 17 putative zinc transport genes identified to date. We found that six of these 13 genes may be essential for fly viability and that three of the remaining seven demonstrate over-expression phenotypes. Our findings reaffirm the previously proposed function of dZnT63C (CG17723: FBgn005432) as an important zinc efflux protein and indicate that the fly homolog of hZip1, dZip42C.1 (CG9428: FBgn0033096), is a strong zinc importer in Drosophila. By combining over-expression of dZip42C.1 with suppression of dZnT63C we were able to produce easily identifiable zinc toxicosis phenotypes, which can be rescued or worsened by modifying dietary zinc content. Our findings show that a genetically based zinc toxicosis situation can be therapeutically treated or exacerbated by modifications to the diet, providing a sensitized background for future, more detailed studies of Zip/ZnT function."},{"title":"Temperature dependence of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions in tympanal organs of locusts","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3309","abstract":"Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in tympanal organs of insects are vulnerable to manipulations that interfere with the animal's physiological state. Starting at a medium temperature, we raised and lowered the locust's body temperature within the range of 12 to 35°C by changing the temperature of the surrounding air, while recording DPOAEs. These experimental manipulations resulted in reversible amplitude changes of the 2f1–f2 emission, which were dependent on stimulus frequency and level. Using low f2 frequencies of up to 10 kHz, a temperature increase (median +8–9°C) led to an upward shift of DPOAE amplitudes of approximately +10 dB, whereas a temperature decrease (median −7°C) was followed by a reduction of DPOAE amplitudes by 3 to 5 dB. Both effects were only present in the range of the low-level component of DPOAE growth functions below L2 levels (levels of the f2 stimulus) of approximately 30 dB SPL. DPOAEs evoked by higher stimulus levels as well as measurements using higher stimulation frequencies above 10 kHz remained unaffected by any temperature shifts. The Arrhenius activation energy was calculated from the −10 dB SPL thresholds (representing the low-level component) of growth functions, which had been measured with 8 and 10 kHz as f2 frequencies and amounted to up to ~34 and 41 kJ mol−1, respectively. Such activation energy values provide a hint that the dynein-tubulin system within the scolopidial receptors could play an essential part in the DPOAE generation in tympanal organs."},{"title":"Multi-functional foot use during running in the zebra-tailed lizard (Callisaurus draconoides)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3293","abstract":"A diversity of animals that run on solid, level, flat, non-slip surfaces appear to bounce on their legs; elastic elements in the limbs can store and return energy during each step. The mechanics and energetics of running in natural terrain, particularly on surfaces that can yield and flow under stress, is less understood. The zebra-tailed lizard (Callisaurus draconoides), a small desert generalist with a large, elongate, tendinous hind foot, runs rapidly across a variety of natural substrates. We use high-speed video to obtain detailed three-dimensional running kinematics on solid and granular surfaces to reveal how leg, foot and substrate mechanics contribute to its high locomotor performance. Running at ~10 body lengths s−1 (~1 m s−1), the center of mass oscillates like a spring-mass system on both substrates, with only 15% reduction in stride length on the granular surface. On the solid surface, a strut-spring model of the hind limb reveals that the hind foot saves ~40% of the mechanical work needed per step, significant for the lizard's small size. On the granular surface, a penetration force model and hypothesized subsurface foot rotation indicates that the hind foot paddles through fluidized granular medium, and that the energy lost per step during irreversible deformation of the substrate does not differ from the reduction in the mechanical energy of the center of mass. The upper hind leg muscles must perform three times as much mechanical work on the granular surface as on the solid surface to compensate for the greater energy lost within the foot and to the substrate."},{"title":"Symmorphosis and the insect respiratory system: a comparison between flight and hopping muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3324","abstract":"Weibel and Taylor's theory of symmorphosis predicts that the structural components of the respiratory system are quantitatively adjusted to satisfy, but not exceed, an animal's maximum requirement for oxygen. We tested this in the respiratory system of the adult migratory locust Locusta migratoria by comparing the aerobic capacity of hopping and flight muscle with the morphology of the oxygen cascade. Maximum oxygen uptake by flight muscle during tethered flight is 967±76 μmol h−1 g−1 (body mass specific, ±95% confidence interval CI), whereas the hopping muscles consume a maximum of 158±8 μmol h−1 g−1 during jumping. The 6.1-fold difference in aerobic capacity between the two muscles is matched by a 6.4-fold difference in tracheole lumen volume, which is 3.5×108±1.2×108 μm3 g−1 in flight muscle and 5.5×107±1.8×107 μm3 g−1 in the hopping muscles, a 6.4-fold difference in tracheole inner cuticle surface area, which is 3.2×109±1.1×109 μm2 g−1 in flight muscle and 5.0×108±1.7×108 μm2 g−1 in the hopping muscles, and a 6.8-fold difference in tracheole radial diffusing capacity, which is 113±47 μmol kPa−1 h−1 g−1 in flight muscle and 16.7±6.5 μmol kPa−1 h−1 g−1 in the hopping muscles. However, there is little congruence between the 6.1-fold difference in aerobic capacity and the 19.8-fold difference in mitochondrial volume, which is 3.2×1010±3.9×109 μm3 g−1 in flight muscle and only 1.6×109±1.4×108 μm3 g−1 in the hopping muscles. Therefore, symmorphosis is upheld in the design of the tracheal system, but not in relation to the amount of mitochondria, which might be due to other factors operating at the molecular level."},{"title":"Resurrecting prehistoric parvalbumins to explore the evolution of thermal compensation in extant Antarctic fish parvalbumins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3281","abstract":"Parvalbumins (PVs) from Antarctic notothenioid fishes display a pattern of thermal adaptation that likely reflects evolutionary changes in protein conformational flexibility. We have used ancestral sequence reconstruction and homology modeling to identify two amino acid changes that could potentially account for the present thermal sensitivity pattern of Antarctic fish PVs compared with a PV from a theoretical warm-adapted ancestral fish. To test this hypothesis, ancient PVs were resurrected in the lab using PV from the notothenioid Gobionotothen gibberifrons as a platform for introducing mutations comparable to the reconstructed ancestral PV sequences. The wild-type PV (WT) as well as three mutant expression constructs were engineered: lysine 8 to asparagine (K8N), lysine 26 to asparagine (K26N) and a double mutant (DM). Calcium equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) versus temperature curves for all mutants were right-shifted, as predicted, relative to that of WT PV. The Kd values for the K8N and K26N single mutants were virtually identical at all temperatures and showed an intermediate level of thermal sensitivity. The DM construct displayed a full conversion of thermal sensitivity pattern to that of a PV from a warm/temperate-adapted fish. Additionally, the Kd versus temperature curve for the WT construct revealed greater thermal sensitivity compared with the mutant constructs. Measurements of the rates of Ca2+ dissociation (koff) showed that all mutants generally had slower koff values than WT at all temperatures. Calculated rates of Ca2+ binding (kon) for the K8N and K26N mutants were similar to values for the WT PV at all temperatures. In contrast, the calculated kon values for the DM PV were faster, providing mechanistic insights into the nature of potentially adaptive changes in Ca2+ binding in this PV. The overall results suggest that the current thermal phenotype of Antarctic PVs can be recapitulated by just two amino acid substitutions."},{"title":"Maximum metabolic rate, relative lift, wingbeat frequency and stroke amplitude during tethered flight in the adult locust Locusta migratoria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/18/3317","abstract":"Flying insects achieve the highest mass-specific aerobic metabolic rates of all animals. However, few studies attempt to maximise the metabolic cost of flight and so many estimates could be sub-maximal, especially where insects have been tethered. To address this issue, oxygen consumption was measured during tethered flight in adult locusts Locusta migratoria, some of which had a weight attached to each wing (totalling 30–45% of body mass). Mass-specific metabolic rate increased from 28±2 μmol O2 g−1 h−1 at rest to 896±101 μmol O2g−1 h−1 during flight in weighted locusts, and to 1032±69 μmol O2 g−1 h−1 in unweighted locusts. Maximum metabolic rate of locusts during tethered flight (ṀmO2; μmol O2 h−1) increased with body mass (Mb; g) according to the allometric equation ṀmO2=994Mb0.75±0.19, whereas published metabolic rates of moths and orchid bees during hovering free flight (ṀhO2) are approximately 2.8-fold higher, ṀhO2=2767Mb0.72±0.08. The modest flight metabolic rate of locusts is unlikely to be an artefact of individuals failing to exert themselves, because mean maximum lift was not significantly different from that required to support body mass (95±8%), mean wingbeat frequency was 23.7±0.6 Hz, and mean stroke amplitude was 105±5 deg in the forewing and 96±5 deg in the hindwing – all of which are close to free-flight values. Instead, the low cost of flight could reflect the relatively small size and relatively modest anatomical power density of the locust flight motor, which is a likely evolutionary trade-off between flight muscle maintenance costs and aerial performance."},{"title":"Bilateral coordination and the motor basis of female preference for sexual signals in canary song","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/2950","abstract":"The preference of female songbirds for particular traits in the songs of courting males has received considerable attention, but the relationship of preferred traits to male quality is poorly understood. Female domestic canaries (Serinus canaria, Linnaeus) preferentially solicit copulation with males that sing special high repetition rate, wide-band, multi-note syllables, called ‘sexy’ or A-syllables. Syllables are separated by minibreaths but each note is produced by pulsatile expiration, allowing high repetition rates and long duration phrases. The wide bandwidth is achieved by including two notes produced sequentially on opposite sides of the syrinx, in which the left and right sides are specialized for low or high frequencies, respectively. The emphasis of low frequencies is facilitated by a positive relationship between syllable repetition rate and the bandwidth of the fundamental frequency of notes sung by the left syrinx, such that bandwidth increases with increasing syllable repetition rate. The temporal offset between notes prevents cheating by unilaterally singing a note on the left side with a low fundamental frequency and prominent higher harmonics. The syringeal and respiratory motor patterns by which sexy syllables are produced support the hypothesis that these syllables provide a sensitive vocal–auditory indicator of a male's performance limit for the rapid, precisely coordinated interhemispheric switching, which is essential for many sensory and motor processes involving specialized contributions from each cerebral hemisphere."},{"title":"A model based on oscillatory threshold and build-up of a developmental substance explains gating of adult emergence in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/2960","abstract":"Adult emergence (eclosion) of fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster under constant laboratory conditions follows a circadian pattern with bouts of eclosion recurring at approximately 24 h intervals. Under periodic light:dark (LD) cycles, adults emerge only during a specific time of the day followed by little or no emergence for the rest of the day. This phenomenon is therefore equated to a gate of emergence that, when open, allows adults to emerge and when closed, no emergence takes place. In this study, we attempt to understand the mechanism underlying adult emergence rhythm in D. melanogaster using a model based on interplay between developmental and circadian clock systems. The model is composed of an oscillatory threshold of a substance that builds up during pre-adult development. Computer simulations based on this model enabled us to make specific predictions about the ‘gate width’ of the adult emergence rhythm under conditions of fast/slow pre-adult development and short/long circadian periods, which we subsequently tested empirically. The main predictions from the simulations are: (1) flies with faster development have greater gate width and vice versa, and (2) flies with faster circadian clocks have shorter gate width and vice versa. To empirically validate these predictions, we carried out experiments on D. melanogaster populations known to have fast/slow pre-adult development, short/long circadian periods and narrow/wide gate width. Additionally, we manipulated the rate of pre-adult development of the above flies by increasing/decreasing ambient temperature to further examine the influence of developmental rates on gate width of adult emergence rhythm by a complementary approach. The results show that gate width is greatly influenced by the duration of pre-adult development and the length of circadian cycles. This suggests that the adult emergence rhythm of D. melanogaster may be based on mechanisms involving oscillatory threshold and build-up of a developmental substance."},{"title":"New model for gain control of signal intensity to object distance in echolocating bats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3045","abstract":"Echolocating bats emit ultrasonic calls and listen for the returning echoes to orient and localize prey in darkness. The emitted source level, SL (estimated signal intensity 10 cm from the mouth), is adjusted dynamically from call to call in response to sensory feedback as bats approach objects. A logarithmic relationship of SL=20log10(x), i.e. 6 dB output reduction per halving of distance, x, has been proposed as a model for the relationship between emitted intensity and object distance, not only for bats but also for echolocating toothed whales. This logarithmic model suggests that the approaching echolocator maintains a constant intensity impinging upon the object, but it also implies ever-increasing source levels with distance, a physical and biological impossibility. We developed a new model for intensity compensation with an exponential rise to the maximum source level: SL=SLmax–ae–bx. In addition to providing a method for estimating maximum output, the new model also offers a tool for estimating a minimum detection distance where intensity compensation starts. We tested the new exponential model against the ‘conventional’ logarithmic model on data from five bat species. The new model performed better in 77% of the trials and as good as the conventional model in the rest (23%). We found much steeper rates of compensation when fitting the model to individual rather than pooled data, with slopes often steeper than –20 dB per halving of distance. This emphasizes the importance of analyzing individual events. The results are discussed in light of habitat constraints and the interaction between bats and their eared prey."},{"title":"Differential physiological responses of the German cockroach to social interactions during the ovarian cycle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3037","abstract":"In many animal species, social interactions can influence the morphology, physiology and behavior of individuals, including their rate of development and reproduction. Reproduction in cockroaches is regulated by juvenile hormone III (JH), and social interactions have been shown to accelerate female reproduction in the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), by stimulating JH production. However, it is not clear in this or any other insect species whether social facilitation of the reproductive rate occurs throughout the ovarian cycle or only at certain stages. We compared the effects of social interactions during the pre-oviposition period (when JH production is high) and during gestation (when little JH is produced), as well as during the first ovarian cycle (when females are virgin) and the second ovarian cycle (after females had mated). Social interaction with one conspecific female was sufficient to accelerate JH production and oocyte maturation, but this effect was reversed by crowding. Social interactions also accelerated the onset of sexual receptivity in virgin females. However, social interactions failed to shorten gestation, suggesting that social cues stimulate JH production only when the corpora allata (CA) are active and not when CA activity is suppressed by the central nervous system. Females were most responsive to transient social isolation and transient social interactions when 2–3 days old, suggesting that they are particularly sensitive to social interactions when their CA become active. Overall, these results show that all JH-dependent events in the reproductive cycle of B. germanica females are under the strong influence of social interactions."},{"title":"Mechanisms contributing to the dopamine induction of crawl-like bursting in leech motoneurons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3028","abstract":"Dopamine (DA) activates fictive crawling behavior in the medicinal leech. To identify the cellular mechanisms underlying this activation at the level of crawl-specific motoneuronal bursting, we targeted potential cAMP-dependent events that are often activated through DA1-like receptor signaling pathways. We found that isolated ganglia produced crawl-like motoneuron bursting after bath application of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDIs) that upregulated cAMP. This bursting persisted in salines in which calcium ions were replaced with equimolar cobalt or nickel, but was blocked by riluzole, an inhibitor of a persistent sodium current. PDI-induced bursting contained a number of patterned elements that were statistically similar to those observed during DA-induced fictive crawling, except that one motoneuron (CV) exhibited bursting during the contraction rather than the elongation phase of crawling. Although DA and the PDIs produced similar bursting profiles, intracellular recordings from motoneurons revealed differences in altered membrane properties. For example, DA lowered motoneuron excitability whereas the PDIs increased resting discharge rates. We suggest that PDIs (and DA) activate a sodium-influx-dependent timing mechanism capable of setting the crawl rhythm and that multiple DA receptor subtypes are involved in shaping and modulating the phase relationships and membrane properties of cell-specific members of the crawl network to generate crawling."},{"title":"Serotonin-induced brain glycogenolysis in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/2969","abstract":"In this study, we evaluated the serotonin-mediated control of cerebral glycogen levels in the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of serotonin (5-HT) to normoglycemic trout (time and dose response) decreased glycogen levels in the brain and increased brain glycogen phosphorylase activity (time response). In hypoglycemic fish (that had been fasted for 5 and 10 days), there was a time-dependent decrease in brain glycogen levels; under these conditions, i.c.v. administration of 5-HT also reduced the brain glycogen content in fish that had been fasted for 5 days. In fish with local cerebral hypoglycemia (induced by 2-DG administration), the glycogen levels decreased and, as above, i.c.v. administration of 5-HT also lowered the glycogen content. In hyperglycemic fish, 5-HT did not affect glycogen levels. Administration of receptor agonists 5-HT1A (8-OH-DPAT), 5-HT1B (anpirtoline and CP93129) or 5-HT2 (α-m-5-HT) decreased the brain glycogen levels. This effect was antagonized by the administration of receptor antagonists 5-HT1A (WAY100135 and NAN190), 5-HT1B (NAS181) and 5-HT2B/C (SB206553). Administration of the receptor agonists (±)-DOI (5-HT2A/2C), m-CPP (5-HT2B/2C), BW723C86 (5-HT2B) and WAY 161503 (5-HT2C) led to decreases in the levels of brain glycogen. We found that 5-HT is involved in the modulation of brain glycogen homeostasis in the rainbow trout, causing a glycogenolytic effect when fish are in a normoglycemic or hypoglycemic state, but not when they are in a hyperglycemic state. 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5HT2B and 5-HT2C-like receptors appeared to be involved in the glycogenolytic action of 5-HT, although the effect mediated by 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B was apparently stronger."},{"title":"Evoked-potential audiogram of an Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3055","abstract":"An evoked-potential audiogram was measured for an Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) living in the dolphinarium of Nanning Zoo, China.

The dolphin was trained to remain still at the water surface and to wear soft latex suction-cup EEG electrodes used to measure the animal's envelope-following evoked potentials to the sound stimuli. Responses to 1000 rhythmic 20 ms pip trains for each amplitude/frequency combination were averaged and analysed using a fast Fourier transform to obtain an evoked auditory response. The hearing threshold was defined as the zero crossing point of the response input–output function using linear regression. Fourteen frequencies ranging from 5.6 to 152 kHz were studied. The results showed that most of the thresholds were lower than 90 dB re. 1 μPa (r.m.s.), covering a frequency range from 11.2 to 128 kHz, and the lowest threshold of 47 dB was measured at 45 kHz. The audiogram, which is a function of hearing threshold versus stimulus carrier frequency, presented a U-shape with a region of high hearing sensitivity (within 20 dB of the lowest threshold) between approximately 20 and 120 kHz. At frequencies lower than this high-sensitivity region, thresholds increased at a rate of approximately 11 dB octave–1 up to 93 dB at 5.6 kHz.

Its trachea is an almost solid, elliptical-section tube of uncalcified hyaline cartilage with minimal connective tissue between successive rings. The structure appears to be advantageous for diving and perfectly designed for withstanding repeated collapse and reinflation. This study applies Boyle's law to the respiratory system (lungs, trachea and larynx) and estimates the changes in tracheal volume during a dive. These changes are subsequently compared with the results predicted by a corresponding finite element (FE) structural model, itself based on laboratory studies of the trachea of an adult turtle. Boyle's law predicts that the lungs will collapse first during the initial stages of a dive with tracheal compression beginning at much deeper depths after complete air mass expulsion from the lungs. The FE model reproduces the changes extremely well (agreeing closely with Boyle's law estimations) and provides visual representation of the deformed tracheal luminal area. Initially, the trachea compresses both ventrally and dorsally before levelling ventrally. Bulges are subsequently formed laterally and become more pronounced at deeper depths. The geometric configuration of the tracheal structure confers both homogeneity and strength upon it, which makes it extremely well suited for enduring repeated collapse and re-expansion. The structure actually promotes collapse and is an adaptation to the turtle's natural environment in which large numbers of deep dives are performed annually."},{"title":"The effect of surface water and wetting on gecko adhesion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3080","abstract":"Despite profound interest in the mechanics and performance of the gecko adhesive system, relatively few studies have focused on performance under conditions that are ecologically relevant to the natural habitats of geckos. Because geckos are likely to encounter surfaces that are wet, we used shear force adhesion measurements to examine the effect of surface water and toe pad wetting on the whole-animal performance of a tropical-dwelling gecko (Gekko gecko). To test the effect of surface wetting, we measured the shear adhesive force of geckos on three substrate conditions: dry glass, glass misted with water droplets and glass fully submerged in water. We also investigated the effect of wetting on the adhesive toe pad by soaking the toe pads prior to testing. Finally, we tested for repeatability of the adhesive system in each wetting condition by measuring shear adhesion after each step a gecko made under treatment conditions. Wetted toe pads had significantly lower shear adhesive force in all treatments (0.86±0.09 N) than the control (17.96±3.42 N), as did full immersion in water (0.44±0.03 N). Treatments with droplets of water distributed across the surface were more variable and did not differ from treatments where the surface was dry (4.72±1.59 N misted glass; 9.76±2.81 N dry glass), except after the gecko took multiple steps. These findings suggest that surface water and the wetting of a gecko's adhesive toe pads may have significant consequences for the ecology and behavior of geckos living in tropical environments."},{"title":"Leg adjustments during running across visible and camouflaged incidental changes in ground level","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3072","abstract":"During running in a natural environment, humans must routinely negotiate varied and unpredictable changes in ground level. To prevent a fall, changes in ground level, especially those that are invisible, require a quick response of the movement system within a short time. For 11 subjects we investigated two consecutive contacts during running across visible (drop of 0, 5 and 10 cm) and camouflaged (drop of 0 and 10 cm) changes in ground level. For both situations, we found significant variances in their leg parameters and ground reaction forces (GRFs) during the perturbed second contact but also one step ahead, in the unperturbed first contact. At visible first contact, humans linearly adapt their GRF to lower and smooth their centre of mass. During the camouflaged situation, the GRF also decreased, but it seems that the runners anticipate a drop of approximately 5–10 cm. The GRF increased with drop height during the visible perturbed second contact. At the camouflaged second contact, GRFs differed noticeably from the observed reaction when crossing a similar visible drop, whereas the contact time decreased and the initial impact peak increased. This increased impact can be interpreted as a purely mechanical contribution to cope with the event. Furthermore, we observed an increased angle of attack and leg length with drop height for both situations. This is in accordance with results observed in birds running over a track with an unexpected drop, and suggests that adaptations in swing leg retraction form part of the strategy for running across uneven ground."},{"title":"Mitochondrial dynamics underlying thermal plasticity of cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) hearts","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/2992","abstract":"In the eurythermal cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, performance depends on hearts that ensure systemic oxygen supply over a broad range of temperatures. We therefore aimed to identify adjustments in energetic cardiac capacity and underlying mitochondrial function supporting thermal acclimation and adaptation that could be crucial for the cuttlefish's competitive success in variable environments. Two genetically distinct cuttlefish populations were acclimated to 11, 16 and 21°C. Subsequently, skinned and permeabilised heart fibres were used to assess mitochondrial functioning by means of high-resolution respirometry and a substrate–inhibitor protocol, followed by measurements of cardiac citrate synthase and cytosolic enzyme activities. Temperate English Channel cuttlefish had lower mitochondrial capacities but larger hearts than subtropical Adriatic cuttlefish. Warm acclimation to 21°C decreased mitochondrial complex I activity in Adriatic cuttlefish and increased complex IV activity in English Channel cuttlefish. However, compensation of mitochondrial capacities did not occur during cold acclimation to 11°C. In systemic hearts, the thermal sensitivity of mitochondrial substrate oxidation was high for proline and pyruvate but low for succinate. Oxygen efficiency of catabolism rose as temperature changed from 11 to 21°C via shifts to oxygen-conserving oxidation of proline and pyruvate and via reduced relative proton leak. The changes observed for substrate oxidation, mitochondrial complexes, relative proton leak and heart mass improve energetic efficiency and essentially seem to extend tolerance to high temperatures and reduce associated tissue hypoxia. We conclude that cuttlefish sustain cardiac performance and, thus, systemic oxygen delivery over short- and long-term changes of temperature and environmental conditions by multiple adjustments in cellular and mitochondrial energetics."},{"title":"Glucosensing capacity in rainbow trout liver displays day–night variations possibly related to melatonin action","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3112","abstract":"To assess whether the glucosensing capacity in peripheral (liver and Brockmann bodies) and central (hypothalamus and hindbrain) locations of rainbow trout displays day–night variations in its response to changes in circulating glucose levels, we evaluated the response of parameters related to glucosensing [glucose, glycogen and glucose 6-phosphate levels, activities of glucokinase (GK), glycogen synthetase (GSase) and pyruvate kinase (PK), and mRNA abundance of GK, glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), and KATP channel subunits Kir6.x-like and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)-like] in fish subjected to hyperglycemic treatment under night or day conditions. No day–night significant variations were noticed in the glucosensing capacity of the hypothalamus, hindbrain and Brockmann bodies. In contrast, a clear differential response was noticed in the liver, where glucose levels, GK activity (and mRNA levels) and GSase activity displayed increased values during the day in hyperglycemic fish compared with controls, and lower (GK mRNA levels) or non-existent (glucose, GK and GSase activities, and Kir6.x-like mRNA levels) values during the night. A similar decrease in parameters related to glucosensing in the liver was observed when fish under day conditions were treated with melatonin, suggesting a modulatory role of melatonin in day–night changes of the glucosensing response in the same tissue."},{"title":"Trade-offs between burst performance and maximal exertion capacity in a wild amphibian, Xenopus tropicalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3106","abstract":"Trade-offs are thought to impose barriers to phenotypic diversification and may limit the evolutionary responses of organisms to environmental changes. In particular, locomotor trade-offs between endurance or maximal exertion capacity and burst performance capacity have been observed in some species and may constrain the ability of organisms to disperse. Here, we tested for the presence of locomotor trade-offs between maximal exertion and burst performance capacity in an aquatic frog, the tropical clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis). Given the importance of overland dispersal for this species, we focused on terrestrial exertion capacity (time and distance jumped until exhaustion) and tested whether it trades-off with aquatic burst performance capacity (maximum instantaneous velocity and acceleration), which is likely to be relevant in the context of predator escape and prey capture. Our data show that in both sexes, individuals with longer hindlimbs display higher endurance. Additionally, in females forelimb length was positively correlated with aquatic burst performance capacity and negatively correlated with terrestrial exertion. Trade-offs between endurance and burst performance capacity were detected, but were significant in males only. Finally, males and females differ in morphology and performance. Our data suggest that trade-offs are not universal and may be driven by sex-dependent selection on locomotor capacity. Moreover, our results suggest that locomotor trade-offs may result in sex-biased dispersal under selection for improved endurance capacity as is expected under habitat fragmentation scenarios."},{"title":"The neural mechanisms of antennal positioning in flying moths","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3096","abstract":"In diverse insects, the forward positioning of the antenna is often among the first behavioral indicators of the onset of flight. This behavior may be important for the proper acquisition of the mechanosensory and olfactory inputs by the antennae during flight. Here, we describe the neural mechanisms of antennal positioning in hawk moths from behavioral, neuroanatomical and neurophysiological perspectives. The behavioral experiments indicated that a set of sensory bristles called Böhm's bristles (or hair plates) mediate antennal positioning during flight. When these sensory structures were ablated from the basal segments of their antennae, moths were unable to bring their antennae into flight position, causing frequent collisions with the flapping wing. Fluorescent dye-fills of the underlying sensory and motor neurons revealed that the axonal arbors of the mechanosensory bristle neurons spatially overlapped with the dendritic arbors of the antennal motor neurons. Moreover, the latency between the activation of antennal muscles following stimulation of sensory bristles was also very short (<10 ms), indicating that the sensorimotor connections may be direct. Together, these data show that Böhm's bristles control antennal positioning in moths via a reflex mechanism. Because the sensory structures and motor organization are conserved across most Neoptera, the mechanisms underlying antennal positioning, as described here, are likely to be conserved in these diverse insects."},{"title":"Locomotory activity and feeding strategy of the hadal munnopsid isopod Rectisura cf. herculea (Crustacea: Asellota) in the Japan Trench","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3010","abstract":"Benthic fauna in the hadal zone (6500-11,000 m) rely on maintaining sufficient locomotory activity to exploit a low, patchy and uniquely distributed food supply while exposed to high pressure, low temperatures and responding to predator-prey interactions. Very little is currently known about the locomotory capabilities of hadal fauna. In situ video footage of the isopod Rectisura cf. herculea (Birstein 1957) (Asellota, Munnopsidae) was obtained from 6945 and 7703 m deep in the Japan Trench (NW Pacific Ocean). Measurements of locomotion revealed routine walking speeds of 0.19±0.04 BL s-1 (mean ± s.d.), increasing to 0.33±0.04 BL s-1 if naturally perturbed by larger organisms. When immediately threatened by the presence of predators (decapod crustaceans), the isopods are capable of eliciting backward escape jumps and burst swimming escape responses of 2.6±1.5 BL s-1 and 4.63±0.9 BL s-1, respectively. These data suggest no significant reduction in locomotory capability despite the extreme depths in which they inhabit. These observations also revealed the isopod to be a bait-attending and aggregative species and suggest that it may not be obligatorily selecting infaunal food sources as previously thought."},{"title":"Hepatic confinement of newly produced erythrocytes caused by low-temperature exposure in Xenopus laevis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3087","abstract":"Diminished erythrocyte count and erythropoiesis have been reported during hypothermia in some ectothermic animals. In this study, the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, was used to investigate the cause of hypothermia-induced anemia. We developed a new model of hypothermia at 5°C and monitored blood cell count and erythropoiesis on several days. Erythrocyte count declined by 30% on the first day following cold exposure (5°C) and mRNA expression of hemeoxygenase-1 was enhanced 10-fold; accumulation of iron as a result of heme degradation was observed in the liver. One day after low-temperature exposure, erythropoietin mRNA expression was elevated in the liver and lung compared with that at normal temperature (22°C) by qRT-PCR analysis. Examination of liver sections (i.e. the erythropoietic organ) showed an increase in o-dianisidine-positive erythrocytes in the hepatic sinusoid 5 days after the onset of low-temperature exposure compared with normal liver. Peripheral erythrocyte count remained low, indicating that newly produced erythrocytes did not migrate from the liver to the circulation during hypothermia. In conclusion, this study reveals hypothermic anemia as being associated with hepatic erythrocyte destruction; prolonged anemia during low-temperature exposure is concomitant with newly produced erythrocytes being confined to the liver and may lead to new insights into vertebrate hematopoiesis."},{"title":"Underwater hearing in the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta): a comparison of behavioral and auditory evoked potential audiograms","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3001","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare underwater behavioral and auditory evoked potential (AEP) audiograms in a single captive adult loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta). The behavioral audiogram was collected using a go/no-go response procedure and a modified staircase method of threshold determination. AEP thresholds were measured using subdermal electrodes placed beneath the frontoparietal scale, dorsal to the midbrain. Both methods showed the loggerhead sea turtle to have low frequency hearing with best sensitivity between 100 and 400 Hz. AEP testing yielded thresholds from 100 to 1131 Hz with best sensitivity at 200 and 400 Hz (110 dB re. 1 μPa). Behavioral testing using 2 s tonal stimuli yielded underwater thresholds from 50 to 800 Hz with best sensitivity at 100 Hz (98 dB re. 1 μPa). Behavioral thresholds averaged 8 dB lower than AEP thresholds from 100 to 400 Hz and 5 dB higher at 800 Hz. The results suggest that AEP testing can be a good alternative to measuring a behavioral audiogram with wild or untrained marine turtles and when time is a crucial factor."},{"title":"High genetic diversity and low differentiation in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) along the southeastern coast of China revealed by microsatellite markers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3120","abstract":"The mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) is a carnivorous portunid crab, mainly distributed along the southeastern coast of China. Mitochondrial DNA analysis in a previous study indicated a high level of genetic diversity and a low level of genetic differentiation. In this study, population genetic diversity and differentiation of S. paramamosain were investigated using nine microsatellite markers. In total, 397 wild specimens from 11 locations on the southeastern coast of China were sampled and genotyped. A high level of genetic diversity was observed, with the number of alleles, and the observed and expected heterozygosity per location in the range 7.8–9.6, 0.62–0.77 and 0.66–0.76, respectively. AMOVA analysis indicated a low level of genetic differentiation among the 11 locations, despite the fact that a statistically significant fixation index (FST) value was found (FST=0.0183, P<0.05). Out of 55 pairwise location comparisons, 39 showed significant FST values (P<0.05), but all of them were lower than 0.05, except for one between Sanmen and Shantou locations. No significant deficiency of heterozygotes (inbreeding coefficient FIS=0.0007, P>0.05) was detected for all locations except Sanmen and Zhanjiang. Cluster analysis using UPGMA showed that all locations fell into one group except Sanmen. Significant association was found between genetic differentiation in terms of FST/(1–FST) and the natural logarithm of geographical distance (r2=0.1139, P=0.02), indicating that the genetic variation pattern closely resembled an isolation by distance model. This study supports the proposal of high genetic diversity and low genetic differentiation in S. paramamosain along the southeastern coast of China."},{"title":"Glycogen, not dehydration or lipids, limits winter survival of side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3126","abstract":"Climate change is causing winters to become milder (less cold and shorter). Recent studies of overwintering ectotherms have suggested that warmer winters increase metabolism and decrease winter survival and subsequent fecundity. Energetic constraints (insufficient energy stores) have been hypothesized as the cause of winter mortality but have not been tested explicitly. Thus, alternative sources of mortality, such as winter dehydration, cannot be ruled out. By employing an experimental design that compared the energetics and water content of lizards that died naturally during laboratory winter with those that survived up to the same point but were then sacrificed, we attempt to distinguish among multiple possible causes of mortality. We test the hypothesis that mortality is caused by insufficient energy stores in the liver, abdominal fat bodies, tail or carcass or through excessive water loss. We found that lizards that died naturally had marginally greater mass loss, lower water content, and less liver glycogen remaining than living animals sampled at the same time. Periodically moistening air during winter reduced water loss, but this did not affect survival, calling into question dehydration as a cause of death. Rather, our results implicate energy limitations in the form of liver glycogen, but not lipids, as the primary cause of mortality in overwintering lizards. When viewed through a lens of changing climates, our results suggest that if milder winters increase the metabolic rate of overwintering ectotherms, individuals may experience greater energetic demands. Increased energy use during winter may subsequently limit individual survival and possibly even impact population persistence."},{"title":"Forelimb muscle activity during equine locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/2980","abstract":"Few quantitative data exist to describe the activity of the distal muscles of the equine forelimb during locomotion, and there is an incomplete understanding of the functional roles of the majority of the forelimb muscles. Based on morphology alone it would appear that the larger proximal muscles perform the majority of work in the forelimb, whereas the smaller distal muscles fulfil supplementary roles such as stabilizing the joints and positioning the limb for impact with the ground. We measured the timing and amplitude of the electromyographic activity of the intrinsic muscles of the forelimb in relation to the phase of gait (stance versus swing) and the torque demand placed on each joint during walking, trotting and cantering. We found that all forelimb muscles, except the extensor carpi radialis (ECR), were activated just prior to hoof-strike and deactivated during stance. Only the ECR was activated during swing. The amplitudes of muscle activation typically increased as gait speed increased. However, the amplitudes of muscle activation were not proportional to the net joint torques, indicating that passive structures may also contribute significantly to torque generation. Our results suggest that the smaller distal muscles help to stabilize the forelimb in early stance, in preparation for the passive structures (tendons and ligaments) to be stretched. The distal forelimb muscles remain active throughout stance only during canter, when the net torques acting about the distal forelimb joints are highest. The larger proximal muscles activate in a complex coordination to position and stabilize the shoulder and elbow joints during ground contact."},{"title":"Trafficking of bdelloid rotifer late embryogenesis abundant proteins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2786","abstract":"The bdelloid rotifer Adineta ricciae is an asexual microinvertebrate that can survive desiccation by entering an ametabolic state known as anhydrobiosis. Two late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, ArLEA1A and ArLEA1B, have been hypothesized to contribute to desiccation tolerance in these organisms, since in vitro assays suggest that ArLEA1A and ArLEA1B stabilize desiccation-sensitive proteins and membranes, respectively. To examine their functions in vivo, it is important to analyse the cellular distribution of the bdelloid LEA proteins. Bioinformatics predicted their translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via an N-terminal ER translocation signal and persistence in the same compartment via a variant C-terminal retention signal sequence ATEL. We assessed the localization of LEA proteins in bdelloids and in a mammalian cell model. The function of the N-terminal sequence of ArLEA1A and ArLEA1B in mediating ER translocation was verified, but our data showed that, unlike classical ER-retention signals, ATEL allows progression from the ER to the Golgi and limited secretion of the proteins into the extracellular medium. These results suggest that the N-terminal ER translocation signal and C-terminal ATEL sequence act together to regulate the distribution of rotifer LEA proteins within intracellular vesicular compartments, as well as the extracellular space. We speculate that this mechanism allows a small number of LEA proteins to offer protection to a large number of desiccation-sensitive molecules and structures both inside and outside cells in the bdelloid rotifer."},{"title":"3D reconstruction and analysis of wing deformation in free-flying dragonflies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/17/3018","abstract":"Insect wings demonstrate elaborate three-dimensional deformations and kinematics. These deformations are key to understanding many aspects of insect flight including aerodynamics, structural dynamics and control. In this paper, we propose a template-based subdivision surface reconstruction method that is capable of reconstructing the wing deformations and kinematics of free-flying insects based on the output of a high-speed camera system. The reconstruction method makes no rigid wing assumptions and allows for an arbitrary arrangement of marker points on the interior and edges of each wing. The resulting wing surfaces are projected back into image space and compared with expert segmentations to validate reconstruction accuracy. A least squares plane is then proposed as a universal reference to aid in making repeatable measurements of the reconstructed wing deformations. Using an Eastern pondhawk (Erythimus simplicicollis) dragonfly for demonstration, we quantify and visualize the wing twist and camber in both the chord-wise and span-wise directions, and discuss the implications of the results. In particular, a detailed analysis of the subtle deformation in the dragonfly's right hindwing suggests that the muscles near the wing root could be used to induce chord-wise camber in the portion of the wing nearest the specimen's body. We conclude by proposing a novel technique for modeling wing corrugation in the reconstructed flapping wings. In this method, displacement mapping is used to combine wing surface details measured from static wings with the reconstructed flapping wings, while not requiring any additional information be tracked in the high speed camera output."},{"title":"Intracellular Na+, K+ and Cl− activities in Acheta domesticus Malpighian tubules and the response to a diuretic kinin neuropeptide","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2774","abstract":"The mechanism of primary urine production and the activity of a diuretic kinin, Achdo-KII, were investigated in Malpighian tubules of Acheta domesticus by measuring intracellular Na+, K+ and Cl− activities, basolateral membrane voltage (Vb), fluid secretion and transepithelial ion transport. Calculated electrochemical gradients for K+ and Cl− across the basolateral membrane show they are actively transported into principal cells, and basolateral Ba2+-sensitive K+ channels do not contribute to net transepithelial K+ transport and fluid secretion. A basolateral Cl− conductance was revealed after the blockade of K+ channels with Ba2+, and a current carried by the passive outward movement of Cl− accounts for the hyperpolarization of Vb in response to Ba2+. Ion uptake via Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransport, driven by the inwardly directed Na+ electrochemical gradient, is thermodynamically feasible, and is consistent with the actions of bumetanide, which reduces fluid secretion and both Na+ and K+ transport. The Na+ gradient is maintained by its extrusion across the apical membrane and by a basolateral ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase. Achdo-KII has no significant effect on the intracellular ion activities or Vb. Electrochemical gradients across the apical membrane were estimated from previously published values for the levels of Na+, K+ and Cl− in the secreted fluid. The electrochemical gradient for Cl− favours passive movement into the lumen, but falls towards zero after stimulation by Achdo-KII. This coincides with a twofold increase in Cl− transport, which is attributed to the opening of an apical Cl− conductance, which depolarises the apical membrane voltage."},{"title":"Transgenerational effects of microcystin-LR on Daphnia magna","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2795","abstract":"Anthropogenic and climate factors increase the frequency of problematic cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater. Among other toxins, some cyanobacteria produce microcystins (MCs), which inhibit phosphatases type 1 and type 2A and provokes oxidative stress. Toxic cyanobacteria affect the growth, survival and reproduction of zooplankton, particularly those from the genus Daphnia, which have a central position in pelagic food webs. However, one possibility to ameliorate effects is to biotransform MC via glutathione S transferase (GST) to a less toxic glutathione conjugate. This process was hypothesised to underlie the ability of Daphnia to withstand MC and to explain the enhanced tolerance of the offspring from mothers exposed to toxic cyanobacteria. Thus we conducted multigenerational experiments with D. magna, exposing the parental generation to MC for 1 or 7 days and determining the enzyme-mediated tolerance to MC in their offspring by assessing the acute effect of MC on biotransformation and antioxidant and metabolism enzymes, and through 21 day chronic tests on toxicity and growth. Seven days of exposure of the parental generation to MC induced higher activity of GST and malate dehydrogenase in the offspring and enabled them to increment the catalase activity when challenged with MC, whereas 1 day of exposure of the parental generation did not. Offspring from non-exposed and 1-day-exposed mothers suffered decreased survival when exposed to MC compared with offspring from 7-day-exposed mothers; survival was correlated with the elevated activity of GST, malate dehydrogenase and catalase, suggesting maternal transfer of activation factors. However, increased survival occurred at the expense of individual growth. These results suggest that transgenerational effects are provoked by MC in D. magna, which may explain the observed acquirement of enhanced tolerance over generations."},{"title":"Evaporative water loss, relative water economy and evaporative partitioning of a heterothermic marsupial, the monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2806","abstract":"We examine here evaporative water loss, economy and partitioning at ambient temperatures from 14 to 33°C for the monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides), a microbiotheriid marsupial found only in temperate rainforests of Chile. The monito's standard evaporative water loss (2.58 mg g−1 h−1 at 30°C) was typical for a marsupial of its body mass and phylogenetic position. Evaporative water loss was independent of air temperature below thermoneutrality, but enhanced evaporative water loss and hyperthermia were the primary thermal responses above the thermoneutral zone. Non-invasive partitioning of total evaporative water loss indicated that respiratory loss accounted for 59–77% of the total, with no change in respiratory loss with ambient temperature, but a small change in cutaneous loss below thermoneutrality and an increase in cutaneous loss in and above thermoneutrality. Relative water economy (metabolic water production/evaporative water loss) increased at low ambient temperatures, with a point of relative water economy of 15.4°C. Thermolability had little effect on relative water economy, but conferred substantial energy savings at low ambient temperatures. Torpor reduced total evaporative water loss to as little as 21% of normothermic values, but relative water economy during torpor was poor even at low ambient temperatures because of the relatively greater reduction in metabolic water production than in evaporative water loss. The poor water economy of the monito during torpor suggests that negative water balance may explain why hibernators periodically arouse to normothermia, to obtain water by drinking or via an improved water economy."},{"title":"The skylight gradient of luminance helps sandhoppers in sun and moon identification","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2814","abstract":"To return to the ecologically optimal zone of the beach, the sandhopper Talitrus saltator (Montagu) maintains a constant sea–land direction based on the sun and moon compasses.

Clock-shifted (inverted) sandhoppers tested under the sun (during their subjective night) and under the full moon (during their subjective day) exhibit orientation in accordance with correct identification of the sun and the moon at night.

Amino acids are also essential nutrients for Drosophila melanogaster, especially for female egg production, but how flies detect amino acids and how the feeding response to amino acids is regulated are unknown. In this study, the two-choice preference test, the proboscis extension reflex test and a CAFE assay were performed to explore the ability of D. melanogaster to detect and discriminate amino acids. To determine whether D. melanogaster change their feeding preference to amino acids after being deprived of them, as previously reported in the locust, two groups of flies raised on the usual medium or on glucose medium were compared. Amino-acid-deprived flies demonstrated enhanced preference to an amino acid mixture and to several amino acids. These flies ingested amino acids even when they were replete with glucose. The proboscis extension reflex to particular amino acids was induced only in amino-acid-deprived flies. Our findings indicate that the sensitivity of labellar taste cells to amino acids may change when flies are deficient in amino acid supply, and also reveal that the detection pathways for individual amino acids may differ. We suggest the existence of an amino acid receptor and a monitoring system regulating the feeding responses to amino acids."},{"title":"Flies dynamically anti-track, rather than ballistically escape, aversive odor during flight","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2833","abstract":"Tracking distant odor sources is crucial to foraging, courtship and reproductive success for many animals including fish, flies and birds. Upon encountering a chemical plume in flight, Drosophila melanogaster integrates the spatial intensity gradient and temporal fluctuations over the two antennae, while simultaneously reducing the amplitude and frequency of rapid steering maneuvers, stabilizing the flight vector. There are infinite escape vectors away from a noxious source, in contrast to a single best tracking vector towards an attractive source. Attractive and aversive odors are segregated into parallel neuronal pathways in flies; therefore, the behavioral algorithms for avoidance may be categorically different from tracking. Do flies plot random ballistic or otherwise variable escape vectors? Or do they instead make use of temporally dynamic mechanisms for continuously and directly avoiding noxious odors in a manner similar to tracking appetitive ones? We examine this question using a magnetic tether flight simulator that permits free yaw movements, such that flies can actively orient within spatially defined odor plumes. We show that in-flight aversive flight behavior shares all of the key features of attraction such that flies continuously ‘anti-track’ the noxious source."},{"title":"Early life experience primes resistance to oxidative stress","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2820","abstract":"The extent to which early stress exposure is detrimental to Darwinian fitness may depend on its severity, with mild stress exposure actually having a stimulatory and, possibly, beneficial effect through a hormetic response to the stressful stimulus. We need to understand such hormetic processes to determine how the early environment can help shape a phenotype adapted to the conditions the organism is most likely to experience in its adult environment. Using the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), we tested the hypothesis that individuals exposed to mild heat stress earlier in life will suffer less oxidative stress when faced with high heat stress in adulthood than will individuals either not pre-exposed to heat stress or exposed to high heat stress earlier in life. Our findings demonstrate that early life exposure to mild heat stress primes the system to better withstand oxidative stress when encountering heat stress as an adult. These findings point to a potential mechanism linking early life experiences to future Darwinian fitness."},{"title":"Primiparous and multiparous females differ in mammary gland alveolar development: implications for milk production","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2904","abstract":"Mammary gland capacity is influenced by the number of secretory cells in the gland, the activity of those cells and the size and arrangement of the alveoli that they form. Although reproductive experience has been shown to affect the total number of secretory cells in the gland, its potential effect on the structural development of lobulo-alveolar tissues has not been directly investigated. To examine whether reproductive experience affects lobulo-alveolar development, we took mammary gland biopsies at early and peak lactation from primiparous and multiparous grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) females and used histological techniques to compare cell density, alveolar density and alveolar size within secretory lobules. Primiparous females had a significantly higher cell density compared with multiparous females throughout lactation, suggesting that primiparous females have smaller, less-developed secretory cells. Primiparous females had a significantly smaller average alveolar size compared with multiparous females throughout lactation. Although alveolar density was higher in primiparous females compared with multiparous females at early lactation, there was no significant difference between the groups at peak lactation. These results suggest that the mammary gland of primiparous females may have both a lower secretory capacity and a lower storage capacity on a relative basis than those of multiparous females and demonstrate, for the first time, that reproductive experience has a significant effect on both the rate and pattern of mammary gland alveolar development and, potentially, on a female's capacity for milk production."},{"title":"Dietary protein level affects iridescent coloration in Anna's hummingbirds, Calypte anna","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2742","abstract":"Many animal displays involve colorful ornamental traits that signal an individual's quality as a mate or rival. Brilliant iridescent ornaments are common, but little is currently known about their production cost and signaling value. One potential cost of colorful ornaments is the acquisition of limited dietary resources that may be involved, directly or indirectly, in their production. Protein, the primary component of bird feathers and of many nanostructural components of iridescent traits, is naturally restricted in hummingbird diets (comprised mostly of sugars), suggesting that iridescent coloration may be especially challenging to produce in these animals. In this study, we experimentally investigated the effect of dietary protein availability during molt on iridescent color expression in male Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte anna). We fed captive birds either a 6% (high) or a 3% (low) protein diet and stimulated molt by plucking half the gorget and crown ornaments on each bird as well as the non-ornamental iridescent green tail feathers. We found that birds receiving more protein grew significantly more colorful crown feathers (higher red chroma and redder hue) than those fed the low-protein diet. Diet did not affect gorget coloration, but regrowth of feathers in captivity affected both gorget and crown coloration. Additionally, birds on the high-protein diet grew yellower (higher hue) green tail feathers than birds on the low-protein diet. These results indicate that iridescent ornamental feathers are sensitive to diet quality and may serve as honest signals of nutrition to mates or rivals. Further, because both ornamental and non-ornamental iridescent coloration were affected by conditions during their growth, iridescent color in these birds appears to be generally condition dependent."},{"title":"The dive response redefined: underwater behavior influences cardiac variability in freely diving dolphins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2735","abstract":"A hallmark of the dive response, bradycardia, promotes the conservation of onboard oxygen stores and enables marine mammals to submerge for prolonged periods. A paradox exists when marine mammals are foraging underwater because activity should promote an elevation in heart rate (fH) to support increased metabolic demands. To assess the effect of the interaction between the diving response and underwater activity on fH, we integrated interbeat fH with behavioral observations of adult bottlenose dolphins diving and swimming along the coast of the Bahamas. As expected for the dive response, fH while resting during submergence (40±6 beats min−1) was significantly lower than fH while resting at the water surface (105±8 beats min−1). The maximum recorded fH (fH,max) was 128±7 beats min−1, and occurred during post-dive surface intervals. During submergence, the level of bradycardia was modified by activity. Behaviors such as simple head bobbing at depth increased fH by 40% from submerged resting levels. Higher heart rates were observed for horizontal swimming at depth. Indeed, the dolphins operated at 37–58% of their fH,max while active at depth and approached 57–79% of their fH,max during anticipatory tachycardia as the animals glided to the surface. fH was significantly correlated with stroke frequency (range=0–2.5 strokes s−1, r=0.88, N=25 dives) and calculated swim speed (range=0–5.4 m s−1, r=0.88, N=25 dives). We find that rather than a static reflex, the dive response is modulated by behavior and exercise in a predictable manner."},{"title":"The role of endogenous H2S formation in reversible remodeling of lung tissue during hibernation in the Syrian hamster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2912","abstract":"During hibernation, small mammals alternate between periods of metabolic suppression and low body temperature (‘torpor’) and periods of full metabolic recovery with euthermic temperatures (‘arousal’). Previously, we demonstrated marked structural remodeling of the lung during torpor, which is rapidly reversed during arousal. We also found that cooling of hamster cells increased endogenous production of H2S through the enzyme cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS). H2S suppresses the immune response and increases deposition of collagen. Therefore, we examined inflammatory markers and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in relation to CBS expression and H2S levels in lungs of euthermic and hibernating Syrian hamsters. Lung remodeling during torpor was confirmed by a strong increase in both collagenous and non-collagenous hydroxyproline content. The number of leukocytes in lung was unchanged in any phase of hibernation, while adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, and the inflammatory marker NF-κB (P65) were modestly upregulated in torpor. Gelatinase activity was decreased in lungs from torpid animals, indicating inhibition of the Zn2+-dependent MMP-2 and MMP-9. Moreover, expression of CBS and tissue levels of H2S were increased in torpor. All changes normalized during arousal. Inhibition of gelatinase activity in torpor is likely caused by quenching of Zn2+ by the sulphide ion of H2S. In accord, inhibition of CBS normalized gelatinase activity in torpid animals. Conversely, NaHS decreased the gelatinase activity of euthermic animals, which was attenuated by excess Zn2+. Similar results were obtained on the activity of the Zn2+-dependent angiotensin converting enzyme. Our data indicate that increased production of H2S through CBS in hamster lungs during torpor contributes to remodeling by inhibition of gelatinase activity and possibly by suppression of the inflammatory response. Although administration of H2S is known to induce metabolic suppression in non-hibernating mammals (‘suspended animation’), this is the first report implying endogenous H2S production in natural hibernation."},{"title":"Short-range homing in a site-specific fish: search and directed movements","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2751","abstract":"Sedentary and territorial rockfish of the genus Sebastes exhibit distinctive homing ability and can travel back to an original location after displacements of metres or even kilometres. However, little is known about the behavioural and sensory mechanisms involved in homing. Although our previous study demonstrated that nocturnal black rockfish Sebastes cheni predominantly use their olfactory sense for homing from an unfamiliar area, the possibility of using landmarks in a familiar area cannot be discounted; i.e. site-specific fish are likely to use three-dimensional spatial memory for navigation and orientation. Using high-resolution acoustic telemetry, we investigated whether S. cheni exhibit distinctive homing paths. Results show that all of the eight rockfish increased their effort within a small area of an unfamiliar region around the release site just after displacement, suggesting that the rockfish probably searched for the homeward direction. The rockfish showed the search movement in the upstream and/or downstream direction, which did not lead home. Finally, after returning to their familiar area, the rockfish exhibited more directed movements with faster speeds at a shallower depth, which was similar to the depth utilised in daily life as well as that of the fish capture."},{"title":"Spectral tuning by selective chromophore uptake in rods and cones of eight populations of nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2760","abstract":"The visual pigments of rods and cones were studied in eight Fennoscandian populations of nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius). The wavelength of maximum absorbance of the rod pigment (λmax) varied between populations from 504 to 530 nm. Gene sequencing showed that the rod opsins of all populations were identical in amino acid composition, implying that the differences were due to varying proportions of chromophores A1 and A2. Four spectral classes of cones were found (two S-cones, M-cones and L-cones), correlating with the four classes of vertebrate cone pigments. For quantitative estimation of chromophore proportions, we considered mainly rods and M-cones. In four populations, spectra of both photoreceptor types indicated A2 dominance (population mean λmax=525–530 nm for rods and 535–544 nm for M-cones). In the four remaining populations, however, rod spectra (mean λmax=504–511 nm) indicated strong A1 dominance, whereas M-cone spectra (mean λmax=519-534 nm) suggested substantial fractions of A2. Quantitative analysis of spectra by three methods confirmed that rods and cones in these populations use significantly different chromophore proportions. The outcome is a shift of M-cone spectra towards longer wavelengths and a better match to the photic environment (light spectra peaking >560 nm in all the habitats) than would result from the chromophore proportions of the rods. Chromophore content was also observed to vary partly independently in M- and L-cones with potential consequences for colour discrimination. This is the first demonstration that selective processing of chromophore in rods and cones, and in different cone types, may be ecologically relevant."},{"title":"Spectral transmission of the principal-eye corneas of jumping spiders: implications for ultraviolet vision","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2853","abstract":"Ultraviolet (UV) vision plays an important role in interspecific and intraspecific communication in many animals. However, UV vision and its adaptive significance have been investigated in only approximately 1% of more than 5000 species of jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae), renowned for their unique, complex eyes that support exceptional spatial acuity and visually based behaviour. To appreciate the adaptive significance of UV vision, it is important to establish whether salticids can perceive UV and whether the perception of UV varies with ecological factors such as light environment. In this study, we measured the UV-transmission properties of the principal-eye corneas of 128 salticid species. We found that the corneas of all measured species were able to transmit UV light, making the perception of UV possible. Three classes of corneal spectral transmission curves were identified; the majority of species had a Class II curve with a less-steep slope and a gradual onset of the transmission cut-off; all the remaining species had a Class I curve with a very steep slope and a sharp cut-off except for one species that had a Class III curve with an intermediate step, which appeared as a shoulder on the descending part of the transmission curve. The T50 cut-off transmission values (the wavelength at which 50% of the maximum transmission is reached) in salticid corneas vary with species and light habitat. The corneas of species inhabiting open bush had a higher relative transmission at short wavelengths in the UV than forest species. This is the first investigation of corneal transmission in spiders and suggests that UV perception is widespread in salticids."},{"title":"Measuring airborne components of seismic body vibrations in a Middle-Asian sand-dwelling Insectivora species, the piebald shrew (Diplomesodon pulchellum)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2849","abstract":"Self-produced seismic vibrations have been found for some subterranean rodents but have not been reported for any Insectivora species, although seismic sensitivity has been confirmed for blind sand-dwelling chrysochlorid golden moles. Studying the vocal behaviour of captive piebald shrews, Diplomesodon pulchellum, we documented vibrations, apparently generated by the whole-body wall muscles, from 11 (5 male, 6 female) of 19 animals, placed singly on a drum membrane. The airborne waves of the vibratory drumming were digitally recorded and then analysed spectrographically. The mean frequency of vibration was 160.5 Hz. This frequency matched the periodicity of the deep sinusoidal frequency modulation (159.4 Hz) found in loud screech calls of the same subjects. The body vibration was not related to thermoregulation, hunger-related depletion of energy resources or fear, as it was produced by well-fed, calm animals, at warm ambient temperatures. We hypothesize that in the solitary, nocturnal, digging desert piebald shrew, body vibrations may be used for seismic exploration of substrate density, to avoid energy-costly digging of packed sand for burrowing and foraging. At the same time, the piercing quality of screech calls due to the deep sinusoidal frequency modulation, matching the periodicity of body vibration, may be important for agonistic communication in this species."},{"title":"Interlocking of chelae is a key factor for dominance hierarchy formation in crayfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2841","abstract":"We characterized the role of chelae during agonistic encounters of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii. Physical asymmetries in body length, body mass and chelae size were directly related to dominance hierarchy formation. More than 80% of winning crayfish had longer body and chelae lengths, and winners were usually heavier in body mass, even if their differences were less than 3% compared with losing opponents. In mismatched pairings, large crayfish with short chelae were beaten by small crayfish with large chelae. Three physical elements of body length, body mass and chelae length equally affected the outcome of agonistic bouts. Chelae restriction, in which chelae were tightly closed using rubber bands, affected the outcome of agonistic bouts between large and small crayfish. Before chelae restriction, large crayfish won in all pairings. Following chelae restriction for at least 30 days from the first encounters, the winning rate of large crayfish that were previous winners decreased significantly in the second encounters against the same opponents that were previous losers. The handicap of chelae restriction significantly prolonged the time to formation of the winner–loser relationship. Individual fights escalated during agonistic bouts between large crayfish with one chela restricted and small crayfish with intact chelae, whereas the number of fights increased but the duration of individual fights did not increase in large crayfish with both chelae restricted. Furthermore, when the chelae of both large and small crayfish were disabled, the dominance order was frequently not formed during 30 min of agonistic bouts. Preventing chelae from interlocking prevented escalation of agonistic bouts. We show that interlocking of chelae acted as a key factor for the formation of dominance hierarchy."},{"title":"The relative cost of using luminescence for sex and defense: light budgets in cypridinid ostracods","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2860","abstract":"Luminescent signals can be used by animals for a number of purposes, including courtship and defense, sometimes by the same individual. However, the relative costs of producing these different behaviors are largely unknown. In the marine ostracod Photeros annecohenae, males utilize extracellular luminescence for complex courtship displays, and both males and females luminesce as a predation defense. We compared the relative luminescent output of courtship with that of defensive displays and also with respect to their total luminescent stores. Courtship displays are relatively inexpensive compared with defensive displays, with an average defensive display releasing 50 times more luminescence than the average courtship display. Furthermore, in order to completely exhaust its stores, a male would have to produce 450 typical courtship displays or approximately 10 average defensive displays. Both courtship pulses and defensive displays show first-order decay kinetics, yet courtship pulses decay three times faster than defensive displays, suggesting that there is differential release of the luciferin, luciferase and mucus in order to control the reaction kinetics."},{"title":"Unpredictable food availability induces metabolic and hormonal changes independent of food intake in a sedentary songbird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2920","abstract":"Environments often vary with regard to their temporal resource availability, but little is understood concerning how resource predictability impacts animals. The adaptive regulation hypothesis suggests that organisms act to conserve their current energetic state during periods of diminished food access and recuperate their energetic reserves (fat and muscle) during periods of greater food availability. In contrast, the chronic stress hypothesis suggests that variation in access to food can induce a prolonged stress response, resulting in maladaptive usage of energy reserves and increased behavioral activity. To distinguish between these hypotheses we compared the behavioral, hormonal and metabolic responses of captive curve-billed thrashers, Toxostoma curvirostre, fed varying amounts each day (variable group) with those of birds fed a constant amount every day (constant feeding group). Birds of both groups consumed, on average, a similar total amount of food during the course of the study, but birds in the variable feeding group lost mass and increased their circulating initial levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, showed evidence for increased secretion of a hypothalamic stress peptide, vasotocin, used greater amounts of fat and protein energy reserves, and were more behaviorally active than birds in the constant feeding group. Overall, these findings support the chronic stress hypothesis and suggest that birds such as thrashers may be particularly susceptible to the perception of unpredictable variation in food supplies independent of actual energetic constraints."},{"title":"Median fin function during the escape response of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). I: Fin-ray orientation and movement","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2869","abstract":"The fast-start escape response is critically important to avoid predation, and axial movements driving it have been studied intensively. Large median dorsal and anal fins located near the tail have been hypothesized to increase acceleration away from the threat, yet the contribution of flexible median fins remains undescribed. To investigate the role of median fins, C-start escape responses of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) were recorded by three high-speed, high-resolution cameras at 500 frames s−1 and the 3-D kinematics of individual dorsal and anal fin rays were analyzed. Movement and orientation of the fin rays relative to the body axis were calculated throughout the duration of the C-start. We found that: (1) timing and magnitude of angular displacement varied among fin rays based on position within the fin and (2) kinematic patterns support the prediction that fin rays are actively resisting hydrodynamic forces and transmitting momentum into the water. We suggest that regions within the fins have different roles. Anterior regions of the fins are rapidly elevated to increase the volume of water that the fish may interact with and transmit force into, thus generating greater total momentum. The movement pattern of all the fin rays creates traveling waves that move posteriorly along the length of the fin, moving water as they do so. Flexible posterior regions ultimately act to accelerate this water towards the tail, potentially interacting with vortices generated by the caudal fin during the C-start. Despite their simple appearance, median fins are highly complex and versatile control surfaces that modulate locomotor performance."},{"title":"Myo-inositol as a main metabolite in overwintering flies: seasonal metabolomic profiles and cold stress tolerance in a northern drosophilid fly","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2891","abstract":"Coping with seasonal changes in temperature is an important factor underlying the ability of insects to survive over the harsh winter conditions in the northern temperate zone, and only a few drosophilids have been able to colonize sub-polar habitats. Information on their winter physiology is needed as it may shed light on the adaptive mechanisms of overwintering when compared with abundant data on the thermal physiology of more southern species, such as Drosophila melanogaster. Here we report the first seasonal metabolite analysis in a Drosophila species. We traced changes in the cold tolerance and metabolomic profiles in adult Drosophila montana flies that were exposed to thermoperiods and photoperiods similar to changes in environmental conditions of their natural habitat in northern Finland. The cold tolerance of diapausing flies increased noticeably towards the onset of winter; their chill coma recovery times showed a seasonal minimum between late autumn and early spring, whereas their survival after cold exposure remained high until late spring. The flies had already moderately accumulated glucose, trehalose and proline in autumn, but the single largest change occurred in myo-inositol concentrations. This increased up to 400-fold during the winter and peaked at 147 nmol mg−1 fresh mass, which is among the largest reported accumulations of this compound in insects."},{"title":"Characterization of a β-adrenergic-like octopamine receptor from the rice stem borer (Chilo suppressalis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2646","abstract":"Octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of adrenaline and noradrenaline, plays a key role in regulation of many physiological and behavioral processes in insects. It modulates these functions through binding to specific octopamine receptors, which are typical rhodopsin-like G-protein coupled receptors. A cDNA encoding a seven-transmembrane receptor was cloned from the nerve cord of the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis, viz. CsOA2B2, which shares high sequence similarity to CG6989, a Drosophila β-adrenergic-like octopamine receptor (DmOctβ2R). We generated an HEK-293 cell line that stably expresses CsOA2B2 in order to examine the functional and pharmacological properties of this receptor. Activation of CsOA2B2 by octopamine increased the production of cAMP in a dose-dependent manner (EC50=2.33 nmol l–1), with a maximum response at 100 nmol l–1. Tyramine also activated the receptor but with much less potency than octopamine. Dopamine and serotonin had marginal effects on cAMP production. Using a series of known agonists and antagonists for octopamine receptors, we observed a rather unique pharmacological profile for CsOA2B2 through measurements of cAMP. The rank order of potency of the agonists was naphazoline > clonidine. The activated effect of octopamine is abolished by co-incubation with phentolamine, mianserin or chlorpromazine. Using in vivo pharmacology, CsOA2B2 antagonists mianserin and phentolamine impaired the motor ability of individual rice stem borers. The results of the present study are important for a better functional understanding of this receptor as well as for practical applications in the development of environmentally sustainable pesticides."},{"title":"Encephalic photoreception and phototactic response in the troglobiont Somalian blind cavefish Phreatichthys andruzzii","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2898","abstract":"Many physiological and behavioural responses to changes in environmental lighting conditions are mediated by extraocular photoreceptors. Here we investigate encephalic photoreception in Phreatichthys andruzzii, a typical cave-dwelling fish showing an extreme phenotype with complete anophthalmy and a reduction in size of associated brain structures. We firstly identified two P. andruzzii photopigments, orthologues of rod opsin and exo-rod opsin. In vitro, both opsins serve as light-absorbing photopigments with λmax around 500 nm when reconstituted with an A1 chromophore. When corrected for the summed absorption from the skin and skull, the spectral sensitivity profiles shifted to longer wavelengths (rod opsin: 521 nm; exo-rod opsin: 520 nm). We next explored the involvement of both opsins in the negative phototaxis reported for this species. A comparison of the spectral sensitivity of the photophobic response with the putative A2 absorbance spectra corrected for skin/skull absorbance indicates that the A2 versions of either or both of these pigments could explain the observed behavioural spectral sensitivity."},{"title":"Locomotion on a slope in leaf-cutter ants: metabolic energy use, behavioural adaptations and the implications for route selection on hilly terrain","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2545","abstract":"The metabolic cost of the negotiation of obstacles, and the influence that this has on route selection, are important determinants of an animal's locomotor behaviour. We determined the gross metabolic cost of locomotion on slopes of different gradients, ranging from –90 to +90 deg, in leaf-cutter ants (Acromyrmex octospinosus) in a closed-circuit respirometry system. Ants were able to select their preferred speed for each gradient. The gross metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance travelled on the slope (Cpath) was calculated from the rate of CO2 production and the speed of locomotion. These data were used to predict the optimal slopes for minimising the vertical cost of locomotion and vertical journey time. The gross rate of CO2 production was approximately constant (1.7 ml g–1 h–1) and was not significantly affected by slope. Ants moderated their speed with slope (P<0.05), travelling the fastest during level locomotion (2.0±0.1 cm s–1, N=20) and increasingly slowly with increased gradient (both on an incline and a decline). Cpath varied significantly with slope, being lowest during level locomotion (646.0±51.2 J kg–1 m–1) and increasing with increasing gradient. These results suggest that ants adapt their locomotor behaviour to keep metabolic rate constant despite changing mechanical demands. It is predicted that when undertaking a journey involving vertical displacement that ants will select routes with a gradient of between 51 and 57 deg during ascent and with a gradient of between –45 and –51 deg during descent, in order to minimise both vertical journey time and vertical cost of locomotion."},{"title":"Median fin function during the escape response of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). II: Fin-ray curvature","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/16/2881","abstract":"Although kinematic analysis of individual fin rays provides valuable insight into the contribution of median fins to C-start performance, it paints an incomplete picture of the complex movements and deformation of the flexible fin surface. To expand our analysis of median fin function during the escape response of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), patterns of spanwise and chordwise curvature of the soft dorsal and anal fin surfaces were examined from the same video sequences previously used in analysis of fin-ray movement and orientation. We found that both the span and chord undergo undulation, starting in the anterior region of either fin. Initiated early in Stage 1 of the C-start, the undulation travels in a postero-distal direction, reaching the trailing edge of the fins during early Stage 2. Maximum spanwise curvature typically occurred among the more flexible posterior fin rays, though there was no consistent correlation between maximum curvature and fin-ray position. Undulatory patterns suggest different mechanisms of action for the fin regions. In the anterior fin region, where the fin rays are oriented dorsoventrally, undulation is directed primarily chordwise, initiating a transfer of momentum into the water to overcome the inertia of the flow and direct the water posteriorly. Within the posterior region, where the fin rays are oriented caudally, undulation is predominantly directed spanwise; thus, the posterior fin region acts to ultimately accelerate this water towards the tail to increase thrust forces. Treatment of median fins as appendages with uniform properties does not do justice to their complexity and effectiveness as control surfaces."},{"title":"Human skeletal muscle biochemical diversity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2551","abstract":"The molecular components largely responsible for muscle attributes such as passive tension development (titin and collagen), active tension development (myosin heavy chain, MHC) and mechanosensitive signaling (titin) have been well studied in animals but less is known about their roles in humans. The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive analysis of titin, collagen and MHC isoform distributions in a large number of human muscles, to search for common themes and trends in the muscular organization of the human body. In this study, 599 biopsies were obtained from six human cadaveric donors (mean age 83 years). Three assays were performed on each biopsy – titin molecular mass determination, hydroxyproline content (a surrogate for collagen content) and MHC isoform distribution. Titin molecular mass was increased in more distal muscles of the upper and lower limbs. This trend was also observed for collagen. Percentage MHC-1 data followed a pattern similar to collagen in muscles of the upper extremity but this trend was reversed in the lower extremity. Titin molecular mass was the best predictor of anatomical region and muscle functional group. On average, human muscles had more slow myosin than other mammals. Also, larger titins were generally associated with faster muscles. These trends suggest that distal muscles should have higher passive tension than proximal ones, and that titin size variability may potentially act to ‘tune’ the protein's mechanotransduction capability."},{"title":"Regulation of metabolism by dietary carbohydrates in two lines of rainbow trout divergently selected for muscle fat content","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2567","abstract":"Previous studies in two rainbow trout lines divergently selected for lean (L) or fat (F) muscle suggested that they differ in their ability to metabolise glucose. In this context, we investigated whether genetic selection for high muscle fat content led to a better capacity to metabolise dietary carbohydrates. Juvenile trout from the two lines were fed diets with or without gelatinised starch (17.1%) for 10 weeks, after which blood, liver, muscle and adipose tissues were sampled. Growth rate, feed efficiency and protein utilisation were lower in the F line than in the L line. In both lines, intake of carbohydrates was associated with a moderate post-prandial hyperglycaemia, a protein sparing effect, an enhancement of nutrient (TOR-S6) signalling cascade and a decrease of energy-sensing enzyme (AMPK). Gene expression of hepatic glycolytic enzymes was higher in the F line fed carbohydrates compared with the L line, but concurrently transcripts for the gluconeogenic enzymes was also higher in the F line, possibly impairing glucose homeostasis. However, the F line showed a higher gene expression of hepatic enzymes involved in lipogenesis and fatty acid bioconversion, in particular with an increased dietary carbohydrate intake. Enhanced lipogenic potential coupled with higher liver glycogen content in the F line suggests better glucose storage ability than the L line. Overall, the present study demonstrates the changes in hepatic intermediary metabolism resulting from genetic selection for high muscle fat content and dietary carbohydrate intake without, however, any interaction for an improved growth or glucose utilisation in the peripheral tissues."},{"title":"Circulating nitric oxide metabolites and cardiovascular changes in the turtle Trachemys scripta during normoxia, anoxia and reoxygenation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2560","abstract":"Turtles of the genus Trachemys show a remarkable ability to survive prolonged anoxia. This is achieved by a strong metabolic depression, redistribution of blood flow and high levels of antioxidant defence. To understand whether nitric oxide (NO), a major regulator of vasodilatation and oxygen consumption, may be involved in the adaptive response of Trachemys to anoxia, we measured NO metabolites (nitrite, S-nitroso, Fe-nitrosyl and N-nitroso compounds) in the plasma and red blood cells of venous and arterial blood of Trachemys scripta turtles during normoxia and after anoxia (3 h) and reoxygenation (30 min) at 21°C, while monitoring blood oxygen content and circulatory parameters. Anoxia caused complete blood oxygen depletion, decrease in heart rate and arterial pressure, and increase in venous pressure, which may enhance heart filling and improve cardiac contractility. Nitrite was present at high, micromolar levels in normoxic blood, as in some other anoxia-tolerant species, without significant arterial–venous differences. Normoxic levels of erythrocyte S-nitroso compounds were within the range found for other vertebrates, despite very high measured thiol content. Fe-nitrosyl and N-nitroso compounds were present at high micromolar levels under normoxia and increased further after anoxia and reoxygenation, suggesting NO generation from nitrite catalysed by deoxygenated haemoglobin, which in turtle had a higher nitrite reductase activity than in hypoxia-intolerant species. Taken together, these data indicate constitutively high circulating levels of NO metabolites and significant increases in blood NO after anoxia and reoxygenation that may contribute to the complex physiological response in the extreme anoxia tolerance of Trachemys turtles."},{"title":"Genetic knockdown of a single organic anion transporter alters the expression of functionally related genes in Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2601","abstract":"Insects excrete a wide variety of toxins via the Malpighian (renal) tubules. Previous studies have implicated three transporters in the secretion of the organic anion (OA) methotrexate (MTX) by the Drosophila Malpighian tubule: Drosophila multidrug resistance-associated protein (dMRP, CG6214), a multidrug efflux transporter (MET, CG30344), and an organic anion transporting polypeptide 58Dc (OATP58Dc, CG3380). RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown and P-element insertion mutation of single OA transporter genes were used to evaluate the importance of these three putative transporters in the secretion of MTX by the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster. A major finding is that genetic knockdown of a single OA transporter gene leads to reductions in the expression of at least one other OA transporter gene and in secretion of MTX by Malpighian tubules isolated from flies reared on a standard diet. The pattern of changes indicates that decreases in MTX secretion do not correspond to decreases in dMRP expression in all of the RNAi lines. Genetic knockdown of a single OA transporter gene also alters the extent of upregulation of multiple OA transporter genes in the tubules in response to dietary MTX. Knockdown of dMRP is associated with a decrease in MET expression but an increase in OATP expression when flies are reared on MTX-enriched diet. Our results indicate that dMRP and MET are not the dominant MTX transporters in the tubules when flies are reared on MTX-enriched diets. At least one additional transporter, and possibly OATP, are required for MTX secretion. The implications of our results for studies using genetic knockdown techniques to identify OA transporters in whole tissues such as Malpighian tubules are discussed."},{"title":"The metabolic cost of walking on gradients with a waddling gait","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2579","abstract":"Using open-flow respirometry and video footage (25 frames s–1), the energy expenditure and hindlimb kinematics of barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, were measured whilst they were exercising on a treadmill at gradients of +7 and –7 deg, and on a level surface. In agreement with previous studies, ascending a gradient incurred metabolic costs higher than those experienced on level ground at comparable speeds. The geese, however, are the first species to show an increased duty factor when ascending a gradient. This increased duty factor was accompanied by a longer stance time, which was probably to enable the additional force required for ascending to be generated. Contrary to previous findings, the geese did not experience decreased metabolic costs when descending a gradient. For a given speed, the geese took relatively shorter and quicker strides when walking downhill. This ‘choppy’ stride and perhaps a lack of postural plasticity (an inability to adopt a more crouched posture) may negate any energy savings gained from gravity's assistance in moving the centre of mass downhill. Also contrary to previous studies, the incremental increase in metabolic cost with increasing speed was similar for each gradient, indicating that the efficiency of locomotion (mechanical work done/chemical energy consumed) is not constant across all walking speeds. The data here suggest that there are species-specific metabolic responses to locomotion on slopes, as well as the established kinematics differences. It is likely that a suite of factors, such as ecology, posture, gait, leggedness and foot morphology, will subtly affect an organism's ability to negotiate gradients."},{"title":"Sensory receptor diversity establishes a peripheral population code for stimulus duration at low intensities","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2586","abstract":"Peripheral filtering is a fundamental mechanism for establishing frequency tuning in sensory systems. By contrast, detection of temporal features, such as duration, is generally thought to result from temporal coding in the periphery, followed by an analysis of peripheral response times within the central nervous system. We investigated how peripheral filtering properties affect the coding of stimulus duration in the electrosensory system of mormyrid fishes using behavioral and electrophysiological measures of duration tuning. We recorded from individual knollenorgans, the electrosensory receptors that mediate communication, and found correlated variation in frequency tuning and duration tuning, as predicted by a simple circuit model. In response to relatively high intensity stimuli, knollenorgans responded reliably with fixed latency spikes, consistent with a temporal code for stimulus duration. At near-threshold intensities, however, both the reliability and the temporal precision of responses decreased. Evoked potential recordings from the midbrain, as well as behavioral responses to electrosensory stimulation, revealed changes in sensitivity across the range of durations associated with the greatest variability in receptor sensitivity. Further, this range overlapped with the natural range of variation in species-specific communication signals, suggesting that peripheral duration tuning affects the coding of behaviorally relevant stimuli. We measured knollenorgan, midbrain and behavioral responses to natural communication signals and found that each of them were duration dependent. We conclude that at relatively low intensities for which temporal coding is ineffective, diversity among sensory receptors establishes a population code, in which duration is reflected in the population of responding knollenorgans."},{"title":"Analytical methods for the geometric optics of thermal vision illustrated with four species of pitvipers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2621","abstract":"The pitviper facial pit is a pinhole camera-like sensory organ consisting of a flask-shaped cavity divided into two chambers by a suspended membrane. Neurophysiological studies and simplified optical models suggest that facial pits detect thermal radiation and form an image that is combined with visual input in the optic tectum to form a single multispectral image. External pit anatomy varies markedly among taxonomic groups. However, optical function depends on unknown internal anatomy. Therefore, we developed methods for relating anatomy to optical performance. To illustrate, we constructed detailed anatomical models of the internal anatomy of the facial pits of four individuals of four pitviper species using X-ray tomography sections of fresh material. We used these models to define the point spread function, i.e. the distribution of radiation from a point source over the pit membrane, for each species. We then used optical physics, heat transfer physics and computational image processing to define the thermal image formed on the pit membrane for each species. Our computed pit membrane images are consistent with behavioral observations if the sensitivity of membrane receptors equals the most sensitive (ca. 0.001°C) laboratory estimates. Vignetting (variation in optical aperture size with view angle) and differences between body and environmental temperatures can create temperature variation across the membrane that greatly exceeds image temperature contrasts, potentially impairing imaging. Spread functions plotted versus source point azimuth and elevation show distinct patterns that suggest new research directions into the relationships among the optical anatomy, ecology, behavior and sensory neurophysiology of pitvipers."},{"title":"The effects of three-dimensional gap orientation on bridging performance and behavior of brown tree snakes (Boiga irregularis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2611","abstract":"Traversing gaps with different orientations within arboreal environments has ecological relevance and mechanical consequences for animals. For example, the orientation of the animal while crossing gaps determines whether the torques acting on the body tend to cause it to pitch or roll from the supporting perch or fail as a result of localized bending. The elongate bodies of snakes seem well suited for crossing gaps, but a long unsupported portion of the body can create large torques that make gap bridging demanding. We tested whether the three-dimensional orientation of substrates across a gap affected the performance and behavior of an arboreal snake (Boiga irregularis). The snakes crossed gaps 65% larger for vertical than for horizontal trajectories and 13% greater for straight trajectories than for those with a 90 deg turn within the horizontal plane. Our results suggest that failure due to the inability to keep the body rigid at the edge of the gap may be the primary constraint on performance for gaps with a large horizontal component. In addition, the decreased performance when the destination perch was oriented at an angle to the long axis of the initial perch was probably a result of the inability of snakes to maintain balance due to the large rolling torque. For some very large gaps the snakes enhanced their performance by using rapid lunges to cross otherwise impassable gaps. Perhaps such dynamic movements preceded the aerial behavior observed in other species of arboreal snakes."},{"title":"Sex differences in fuel use and metabolism during development in fasting juvenile northern elephant seals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2637","abstract":"Many polygynous, capital breeders exhibit sexual dimorphism with respect to body size and composition. Sexual dimorphism is often facilitated by sex differences in foraging behavior, growth rates and patterns of nutrient deposition during development. In species that undergo extended fasts during development, metabolic strategies for fuel use have the potential to influence future reproductive success by directly impacting somatic growth and acquisition of traits required for successful breeding. We investigated sexual dimorphism associated with metabolic strategies for fasting in developing northern elephant seals. Thirty-one juvenile seals of both sexes were sampled over extended fasts during annual autumn haul-outs. Field metabolic rate (FMR) and the contribution of protein catabolism to energy expenditure were estimated from changes in mass and body composition over 23±5 days of fasting (mean ± s.d.). Protein catabolism was assessed directly in a subset of animals based on urea flux at the beginning and end of the fast. Regulatory hormones and blood metabolites measured included growth hormone, cortisol, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, insulin, glucagon, testosterone, estradiol, glucose, urea and β-hydroxybutyrate. Males exhibited higher rates of energy expenditure during the fast but spared body protein stores more effectively than females. Rates of protein catabolism and energy expenditure were significantly impacted by hormone levels, which varied between the sexes. These data suggest that sex differences in fuel metabolism and energy expenditure during fasting arise early in juvenile development and may play an important role in the development of adult traits associated with reproductive success."},{"title":"Directional sensitivity in the thermal response of the facial pit in western diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2630","abstract":"Recent work published in the accompanying paper used a combination of 3D morphological reconstruction to define optical spread functions and heat transfer physics to study how external heat energy would reach the sensory membrane within the facial pit of pitvipers. The results from all of the species examined indicated asymmetric directional sensitivity, e.g. the pit would preferentially respond to stimuli located below and behind the snake. The present study was intended as a test of these findings through a quantitative neurophysiological analysis of directional sensitivity in the facial pit of the western diamondback rattlesnake, Crotalus atrox. An infrared emitter was positioned through a coordinate system (with varying angular orientations and distances) and the response it evoked measured through neurophysiological recordings of a trigeminal nerve branch composed of the afferents from the sensory membrane of the facial pit. Significant differences were found in the strength of the membrane's neural response to a constant stimulus presented at different orientations (relative to the facial pit opening) and over different distances. The peak sensitivity (at 12 deg above and 20 deg in front of the facial pit opening) was in good agreement with the predicted directional sensitivities based on optical spread functions and 3D topography. These findings support the hypothesis that the topography, and functional performance, of the facial pit has undergone an adaptive radiation within the pit vipers, and that differences in the behavioral ecology of the pit vipers (i.e. terrestrial versus arboreal) are reflected within the facial pits."},{"title":"Experience, corpulence and decision making in ant foraging","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2653","abstract":"Social groups are structured by the decisions of their members. Social insects typically divide labour: some decide to stay in the nest while others forage for the colony. Two sources of information individuals may use when deciding whether to forage are their own experience of recent task performance and their own physiology, e.g. fat reserves (corpulence). The former is primarily personal information; the latter may give an indication of the food reserves of the whole colony. These factors are hard to separate because typically leaner individuals are also more experienced foragers. We designed an experiment to determine whether foraging specialisation is physiological or experience based (or both). We invented a system of automatic doors controlled by radio-tag information to manipulate task access and decouple these two sources of information. Our results show that when information from corpulence and recent experience conflict, ants behave only in accordance with their corpulence. However, among ants physiologically inclined to forage (less corpulent ants), recent experience of success positively influenced their propensity to forage again. Hence, foraging is organised via long-term physiological differences among individuals resulting in a relatively stable response threshold distribution, with fine-tuning provided by short-term learning processes. Through these simple rules, colonies can organise their foraging effort both robustly and flexibly."},{"title":"Sensitivity and specificity of the olfactory epithelia of two elasmobranch species to bile salts","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2660","abstract":"Odor detection in vertebrates occurs when odorants enter the nose and bind to molecular olfactory receptors on the cilia or microvilli of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Several vertebrate groups possess multiple, morphologically distinct types of ORNs. In teleost fishes, these different ORN types detect specific classes of biologically relevant odorants, such as amino acids, nucleotides and bile salts. For example, bile salts are reported to be detected exclusively by ciliated ORNs. The olfactory epithelium of elasmobranch fishes (sharks, rays and skates) is comprised of microvillous and crypt ORNs, but lacks ciliated ORNs; thus, it was questioned whether the olfactory system of this group of fishes is capable of detecting bile salts. The present investigation clearly indicates that the olfactory system of representative shark and stingray species does detect and respond to bile salts. Additionally, these species detect glycine-conjugated, taurine-conjugated and non-conjugated bile salts, as do teleosts. These elasmobranchs are less sensitive to the tested bile salts than reported for both agnathans and teleosts, but this may be due to the particular bile salts selected in this study, as elasmobranch-produced bile salts are commercially unavailable. Cross-adaptation experiments indicate further that the responses to bile salts are independent of those to amino acids, a major class of odorant molecules for all tested fishes."},{"title":"Changes in the nitric oxide system in the shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus (Crustacea, decapoda) CNS induced by a nociceptive stimulus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2668","abstract":"Using NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, we characterized the nitric oxide (NO)-producing neurons in the brain and thoracic ganglion of a shore crab subjected to a nociceptive chemical stimulus. Formalin injection into the cheliped evoked specific nociceptive behavior and neurochemical responses in the brain and thoracic ganglion of experimental animals. Within 5–10 min of injury, the NADPH-d activity increased mainly in the neuropils of the olfactory lobes and the lateral antenna I neuropil on the side of injury. Later, the noxious-induced expression of NADPH-d and iNOS was detected in neurons of the brain, as well as in segmental motoneurons and interneurons of the thoracic ganglion. Western blotting analysis showed that an iNOS antiserum recognized a band at 120 kDa, in agreement with the expected molecular mass of the protein. The increase in nitrergic activity induced by nociceptive stimulation suggests that the NO signaling system may modulate nociceptive behavior in crabs."},{"title":"Ontogeny in the visual system of Nile tilapia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2684","abstract":"Retinal neurogenesis in fish facilitates cellular rearrangement throughout ontogeny, potentially allowing for optimization of the visual system to shifts in habitat and behaviour. To test this possibility, we studied the developmental trajectory of the photopic visual process in the Nile tilapia. We examined ontogenetic changes in lens transmission, photoreceptor sensitivity and post-receptoral sensitivity, and used these to estimate changes in cone pigment frequency and retinal circuitry. We observed an ontogenetic decrease in ultraviolet (UV) photoreceptor sensitivity, which resulted from a reduction in the SWS1 cone pigment frequency, and was associated with a reduction in lens transmission at UV wavelengths. Additionally, post-receptoral sensitivity to both UV and long wavelengths decreased with age, probably reflecting changes in photoreceptor sensitivity and retinal circuitry. This novel remodelling of retinal circuitry occurred following maturation of the visual system but prior to reaching adulthood, and thus may facilitate optimization of the visual system to the changing sensory demands. Interestingly, the changes in post-receptoral sensitivity to long wavelengths could not be predicted by the changes observed in lens transmission, cone pigment frequency or photoreceptor sensitivity. This finding emphasizes the importance of considering knowledge of visual sensitivity and retinal processing when studying visual adaptations and attempting to relate visual function to the natural environment. This study advances our understanding of ontogeny in visual systems and demonstrates that the association between different elements of the visual process can be explored effectively by examining visual function throughout ontogeny."},{"title":"Pupil light reflex in the Atlantic brief squid, Lolliguncula brevis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2677","abstract":"Coleoid behavioral ecology is highly visual and requires an eye capable of forming images in a variety of photic conditions. A variable pupil aperture is one feature that contributes to this visual flexibility in most coleoids, although pupil responses have yet to be quantitatively documented for squid. The pupil light reflex (PLR) of the Atlantic brief squid, Lolliguncula brevis, was analyzed by directly exposing one eye of individual squid to light stimuli of varying irradiance and imaging the reflex, while simultaneously recording from the opposite, indirectly stimulated eye to determine whether the constriction was consensual between eyes. A PLR was measured in L. brevis, with an asymmetrical constriction observed under increasing irradiance levels that was not consensual between eyes, although a response of some level was observed in both eyes. Response thresholds ranged between 12.56 and 12.66 log photons cm–2 s–1. The PLR was rapid and dependent upon the stimulus irradiance, achieving half-maximum constriction within 0.49–1.2 s. The spectral responsivity of the PLR was analyzed by measuring the magnitude of the reflex in the eye directly stimulated by light of equal quantal intensity at wavelengths from 410 to 632 nm. The responsivity curve showed a maximum at 500 nm, indicating the eye is especially well suited for vision at twilight. These results, when considered in the context of the ambient light characteristics, show that the PLR of L. brevis contributes to a dynamic visual system capable of adjusting to the highly variable composition of light in its estuarine habitat."},{"title":"Insulin signalling in mushroom body neurons regulates feeding behaviour in Drosophila larvae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2696","abstract":"Whereas the pivotal role of insulin signalling in cell division, growth and differentiation is well documented, its role in the regulation of neuronal function and behaviour has recently become the focus of intense investigation. The simple organization of the Drosophila larval brain and the availability of genetic tools to impair the function of insulin receptor signalling in a spatially specific manner makes Drosophila an attractive model to investigate the role of the insulin pathway in specific behaviours. Here, we show that impairment of insulin signalling in the mushroom body neurons, a structure involved in associative learning, impairs feeding behaviour in the Drosophila larva."},{"title":"Quantitative analysis of crypt cell population during postnatal development of the olfactory organ of the guppy, Poecilia reticulata (Teleostei, Poecilidae), from birth to sexual maturity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2711","abstract":"Crypt cells are one of three types of olfactory sensory neuron, differing from ciliated and microvillar cells in shape, localization and number, and found only in fish. Although crypt cells are morphologically well characterized, their function remains unclear. They were hypothesized to be involved in reproductive behaviours by detecting sex pheromones, but electrophysiological investigations revealed sensitivity to only amino acids. However, the number of crypt cells in adult guppies is not the same in the two sexes. In this study, we compared the size of the crypt cell population in juvenile guppies during the first 90 days after birth. The purpose of our study was to clarify whether a correlation exists between sex and the number of these olfactory neurons. The data show that guppies reach adult crypt cell density when they become sexually mature. Despite a constant increment in volume during development of the olfactory organ, the minimum density of crypt neurons occurs at ∼45 days. Moreover, in the early weeks, the density of crypt neurons is greater in males than in females because in females the total number of cells decreases significantly after just 7 days. In adults, however, crypt neurons are found in higher density in females than in males. These findings suggest that the number of crypt cells is sex specific, with independent developmental dynamics between males and females. A role in pheromone detection could explain such a difference, but the early appearance of crypt cells in the first days of life is suggestive of other, not sexually related, functions."},{"title":"Functional implications of morphological specializations among the pectoral fin rays of the benthic longhorn sculpin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2703","abstract":"Fin ray structure in ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) largely defines fin function. Fin rays convert the muscle activity at the base of the fin to shape changes throughout the external fin web. Despite their critical functional significance, very little is known about the relationship between form and function in this key vertebrate structure. In this study we demonstrate that morphological specializations of the pectoral fin rays of the benthic longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus) have specific functional consequences both within and among individual rays. The fin rays of longhorn sculpin have an elongate unjointed region with a cylindrical shape in cross-section proximally, and are jointed with a crescent-shaped cross-section distally. Variation in the relative length of the proximal versus distal regions affects the location of maximum curvature as well as the mean curvature along the length of individual rays. We experimentally manipulated fin rays to mimic the differential muscle activity that generates curvature of fin rays in living animals. We found that the shape of the fin rays in cross-section affects their curvature. Among fin rays, the most ventral fin rays with relatively longer proximal unjointed regions have a more distal location of maximum curvature. These ventral rays also have higher mean curvature, likely because of a combination of features including the cross-sectional shape, area and diameter of the distal segments as well as their relative size and number, which were not examined in detail here. Because these rays are used routinely for substrate contact, this higher curvature could contribute to increased flexibility for substrate contact behaviors such as clinging or gripping the substrate. These morphological and functional differences among fin rays are correlated with the functional regionalization of the fin. Specifically, the ventral fin rays that are used during substrate contact are more stiff proximally and more highly curved distally than the pectoral rays in the dorsal region, which are longer and used during slow swimming. This study highlights the importance of examining morphological and functional variation both within and among complex structures such as fin rays."},{"title":"Reconfiguration and the reduction of vortex-induced vibrations in broad leaves","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/15/2716","abstract":"Flexible plants, fungi and sessile animals reconfigure in wind and water to reduce the drag acting upon them. In strong winds and flood waters, for example, leaves roll up into cone shapes that reduce drag compared with rigid objects of similar surface area. Less understood is how a leaf attached to a flexible leaf stalk will roll up stably in an unsteady flow. Previous mathematical and physical models have only considered the case of a flexible sheet attached to a rigid tether in steady flow. In this paper, the dynamics of the flow around the leaf of the wild ginger Hexastylis arifolia and the wild violet Viola papilionacea are described using particle image velocimetry. The flows around the leaves are compared with those of simplified physical and numerical models of flexible sheets attached to both rigid and flexible beams. In the actual leaf, a stable recirculation zone is formed within the wake of the reconfigured cone. In the physical model, a similar recirculation zone is observed within sheets constructed to roll up into cones with both rigid and flexible tethers. Numerical simulations and experiments show that flexible rectangular sheets that reconfigure into U-shapes, however, are less stable when attached to flexible tethers. In these cases, larger forces and oscillations due to strong vortex shedding are measured. These results suggest that the three-dimensional cone structure in addition to flexibility is significant to both the reduction of vortex-induced vibrations and the forces experienced by the leaf."},{"title":"Structure and function of the median finfold in larval teleosts","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2359","abstract":"This paper offers a structural and mechanical analysis of the median finfold in larval teleosts. The median finfold is strengthened by bundles of collagen fibres, known as actinotrichia. We demonstrate that these structures contribute to increase the mass of backward accelerated water during swimming. The amount, dimensions, orientation and growth of actinotrichia were measured at various locations along the finfold in several developmental stages of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). Actinotrichia morphology, using light microscopy (e.g. diameter, orientation) and electron microscopy (which revealed their anchoring at proximal and distal ends), correlated with expected lateral forces exerted on the water during swimming. An analytical model is proposed that predicts the extent of camber from the oblique arrangement of the actinotrichia and curvature of the body. Camber of the finfold during swimming was measured from high-speed video recordings and used to evaluate the model predictions. Based on structural requirements for swimming and strain limits for collagen, the model also predicts optimal orientations of actinotrichia. Experimental data confirm the predictions of the model."},{"title":"Flow structure and transport characteristics of feeding and exchange currents generated by upside-down Cassiopea jellyfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2369","abstract":"Quantifying the flows generated by the pulsations of jellyfish bells is crucial for understanding the mechanics and efficiency of their swimming and feeding. Recent experimental and theoretical work has focused on the dynamics of vortices in the wakes of swimming jellyfish with relatively simple oral arms and tentacles. The significance of bell pulsations for generating feeding currents through elaborate oral arms and the consequences for particle capture are not as well understood. To isolate the generation of feeding currents from swimming, the pulsing kinematics and fluid flow around the benthic jellyfish Cassiopea spp. were investigated using a combination of videography, digital particle image velocimetry and direct numerical simulation. During the rapid contraction phase of the bell, fluid is pulled into a starting vortex ring that translates through the oral arms with peak velocities that can be of the order of 10 cm s–1. Strong shear flows are also generated across the top of the oral arms throughout the entire pulse cycle. A coherent train of vortex rings is not observed, unlike in the case of swimming oblate medusae such as Aurelia aurita. The phase-averaged flow generated by bell pulsations is similar to a vertical jet, with induced flow velocities averaged over the cycle of the order of 1–10 mm s–1. This introduces a strong near-horizontal entrainment of the fluid along the substrate and towards the oral arms. Continual flow along the substrate towards the jellyfish is reproduced by numerical simulations that model the oral arms as a porous Brinkman layer of finite thickness. This two-dimensional numerical model does not, however, capture the far-field flow above the medusa, suggesting that either the three-dimensionality or the complex structure of the oral arms helps to direct flow towards the central axis and up and away from the animal."},{"title":"Responses of cricket cercal interneurons to realistic naturalistic stimuli in the field","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2382","abstract":"The ability of the insect cercal system to detect approaching predators has been studied extensively in the laboratory and in the field. Some previous studies have assessed the extent to which sensory noise affects the operational characteristics of the cercal system, but these studies have only been carried out in laboratory settings using white noise stimuli of unrealistic nature. Using a piston mimicking the natural airflow of an approaching predator, we recorded the neural activity through the abdominal connectives from the terminal abdominal ganglion of freely moving wood crickets (Nemobius sylvestris) in a semi-field situation. A cluster analysis of spike amplitudes revealed six clusters, or ‘units’, corresponding to six different subsets of cercal interneurons. No spontaneous activity was recorded for the units of larger amplitude, reinforcing the idea they correspond to the largest giant interneurons. Many of the cercal units are already activated by background noise, sometimes only weakly, and the approach of a predator is signaled by an increase in their activity, in particular for the larger-amplitude units. A scaling law predicts that the cumulative number of spikes is a function of the velocity of the flow perceived at the rear of the cricket, including a multiplicative factor that increases linearly with piston velocity. We discuss the implications of this finding in terms of how the cricket might infer the imminence and nature of a predatory attack."},{"title":"Conditioned response to a magnetic anomaly in the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) involves the trigeminal nerve","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2399","abstract":"There have been recent calls to develop protocols that collect unambiguous measures of behaviour using automatic techniques in conditioning experiments on magnetic orientation. Here, we describe an automated technique for recording the behaviour of Pekin ducks in a conditioning test that allows them to express unrestricted searching behaviour. Pekin ducks were trained to find hidden food in one corner of a square arena below which was placed a magnetic coil that produced a local magnetic anomaly. The trigeminal nerve was anaesthetised by injection of lignocaine hydrochloride 2–3 mm caudal to the medial canthus of each eye, medial to the globe, prior to the presentation of unrewarded tests. Lignocaine-treated ducks showed no initial preference for the magnetic anomaly whereas saline-treated control ducks showed a significant preference at the same age. A second experiment was undertaken in which the trigeminal nerve was surgically severed and 2–3 mm removed, and this surgery abolished the previously observed preference for the corner with the magnetic coil in a small number of ducks. These data show that Pekin ducks are able to detect and use magnetic stimuli to guide unrestricted search behaviour and are consistent with a hypothesis of magnetoreception involving a putative cluster of magnetite in the upper beak."},{"title":"Lateralized behavior in the attacks of largemouth bass on Rhinogobius gobies corresponding to their morphological antisymmetry","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2390","abstract":"Vertebrates show left–right biases in turning direction, limb usage, predator-escape response and use of sensory organs. In particular, some fishes are known to have lateral biases in predatory behaviors corresponding to their morphological antisymmetry. To reveal the effects of these laterally biased behaviors on predator–prey interaction, we conducted behavioral tests of predatory events between largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, and freshwater gobies, Rhinogobius sp., both of which have individuals with a well-developed left side and individuals with a well-developed right side. The left-developed bass tended to approach the goby clockwise from behind, whereas right-developed individuals tended to approach counterclockwise. Congruently, left-developed gobies began their escape maneuvers at a longer distance from bass when they were approached clockwise than when they were approached counterclockwise, whereas right-developed gobies showed the reverse tendency. The longer the distance between bass and gobies at the start of goby escape, the more the subsequent bass strike or dash was delayed. Under these conditions, predation should be more successful when a left (right)-developed bass meets a right (left)-developed goby, and less successful when a left (right)-developed bass meets a left (right)-developed goby. This prediction was consistent with the difference in predation success in our test and in field data from Lake Biwa, Japan. We conclude that lateral biases in the behavioral direction of each morphological type will generate bias in predation success between different combinations of predator and prey types, leading to the maintenance of antisymmetric dimorphism through negative frequency-dependent natural selection."},{"title":"Directional cues in Drosophila melanogaster audition: structure of acoustic flow and inter-antennal velocity differences","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2405","abstract":"Drosophila melanogaster have bilateral antisymmetric antennae that receive the particle velocity component of an acoustic stimulus. Acoustic communication is important in their courtship, which takes place in the acoustic near-field. Here, the small size of the dipole sound source (the male wing) and the rapid attenuation rate of particle velocity produce a spatially divergent sound field with highly variable magnitude. Also, male and female D. melanogaster are not usually stationary during courtship, resulting in a variable directionality of the acoustic stimulus. Using both particle image velocimetry and laser Doppler vibrometry, we examined the stimulus flow around the head of D. melanogaster to identify the actual geometry of the acoustic input to the antennae and its directional response. We reveal that the stimulus changes in both magnitude and direction as a function of its angle of incidence. Remarkably, directionality is substantial, with inter-antennal velocity differences of 25 dB at 140 Hz. For an organism whose auditory receivers are separated by only 660±51 μm (mean ± s.d.), this inter-antennal velocity difference is far greater than differences in intensity observed between tympanal ears for organisms of similar scale. Further, the mechanical sensitivity of the antennae changes as a function of the angle of incidence of the acoustic stimulus, with peak responses along axes at 45 and 315 deg relative to the longitudinal body axis. This work indicates not only that the flies are able to detect differential cues in signal direction, but also that the male song structure may not be the sole determinant of mating success; his spatial positioning is also crucial to female sound reception and therefore also perhaps to her decision making."},{"title":"Decision-making in pigeon flocks: a democratic view of leadership","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2414","abstract":"When travelling in groups, animals frequently have to make decisions on the direction of travel. These decisions can be based on consensus, when all individuals take part in the decision (i.e. democratic decision; social information), or leadership, when one member or a minority of members make the decision (i.e. despotic decision; personal information). Here we investigated whether decision-making on the navigation of small flocks is based on democratic or despotic decisions. Using individual and flock releases as the experimental approach, we compared the homing performances of homing pigeons that fly singly and in groups of three. Our findings show that although small groups were either governed (i.e. when individuals in the flock had age differences) or not (i.e. when individuals in the flock had the same age) by leaders, with concern to decision-making they were all ruled by democratic decisions. Moreover, the individual homing performances were not associated with leadership. Because true leaders did not assume right away the front position in the flock, we suggest that as in human groups, starting from a central position is more effective as it allows leaders to not only transmit their own information but also to average the tendencies of the other group members. Together, the results highlight the importance of democratic decisions in group decision-making."},{"title":"Acclimatization of seasonal energetics in northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) through plasticity of metabolic rates and ceilings","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2418","abstract":"Northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) are faced with energetically expensive seasonal challenges that must be met to ensure survival, including thermoregulation in winter and reproductive activities in summer. Contrary to predictions of life history theory that suggest breeding metabolic rate should be the apex of energetic effort, winter metabolism exceeds that during breeding in several temperate resident bird species. By examining whole-animal, tissue and cellular function, we ask whether seasonal acclimatization is accomplished by coordinated phenotypic plasticity of metabolic systems. We measured summit metabolism (V̇O2,sum), daily energy expenditure (DEE) and muscle oxidative capacity under both winter (December to January) and breeding (May to June) conditions. We hypothesize that: (1) rates of energy utilization will be highest in the winter, contrary to predictions based on life history theory, and (2) acclimatization of metabolism will occur at multiple levels of organization such that birds operate with a similar metabolic ceiling during different seasons. We measured field metabolic rates using heart rate telemetry and report the first daily patterns in avian field metabolic rate. Patterns of daily energy use differed seasonally, primarily as birds maintain high metabolic rates throughout the winter daylight hours. We found that DEE and V̇O2,sum were significantly greater and DEE occurred at a higher fraction of maximum metabolic capacity during winter, indicating an elevation of the metabolic ceiling. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in mass or oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle. These data, highlighting the importance of examining energetic responses to seasonal challenges at multiple levels, clearly reject life history predictions that breeding is the primary energetic challenge for temperate zone residents. Further, they indicate that metabolic ceilings are seasonally flexible as metabolic effort during winter thermoregulation exceeds that of breeding."},{"title":"High speed galloping in the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and the racing greyhound (Canis familiaris): spatio-temporal and kinetic characteristics","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2425","abstract":"The cheetah and racing greyhound are of a similar size and gross morphology and yet the cheetah is able to achieve a far higher top speed. We compared the kinematics and kinetics of galloping in the cheetah and greyhound to investigate how the cheetah can attain such remarkable maximum speeds. This also presented an opportunity to investigate some of the potential limits to maximum running speed in quadrupeds, which remain poorly understood. By combining force plate and high speed video data of galloping cheetahs and greyhounds, we show how the cheetah uses a lower stride frequency/longer stride length than the greyhound at any given speed. In some trials, the cheetahs used swing times as low as those of the greyhounds (0.2 s) so the cheetah has scope to use higher stride frequencies (up to 4.0 Hz), which may contribute to it having a higher top speed that the greyhound. Weight distribution between the animal's limbs varied with increasing speed. At high speed, the hindlimbs support the majority of the animal's body weight, with the cheetah supporting 70% of its body weight on its hindlimbs at 18 m s–1; however, the greyhound hindlimbs support just 62% of its body weight. Supporting a greater proportion of body weight on a particular limb is likely to reduce the risk of slipping during propulsive efforts. Our results demonstrate several features of galloping and highlight differences between the cheetah and greyhound that may account for the cheetah's faster maximum speeds."},{"title":"Decreased expression of adipose CD36 and FATP1 are associated with increased plasma non-esterified fatty acids during prolonged fasting in northern elephant seal pups (Mirounga angustirostris)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2455","abstract":"The northern elephant seal pup (Mirounga angustirostris) undergoes a 2–3 month post-weaning fast, during which it depends primarily on the oxidation of fatty acids to meet its energetic demands. The concentration of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) increases and is associated with the development of insulin resistance in late-fasted pups. Furthermore, plasma NEFA concentrations respond differentially to an intravenous glucose tolerance test (ivGTT) depending on fasting duration, suggesting that the effects of glucose on lipid metabolism are altered. However, elucidation of the lipolytic mechanisms including lipase activity during prolonged fasting in mammals is scarce. To assess the impact of fasting and glucose on the regulation of lipid metabolism, adipose tissue and plasma samples were collected before and after ivGTTs performed on early (2 weeks, N=5) and late (6–8 weeks; N=8) fasted pups. Glucose administration increased plasma triglycerides and NEFA concentrations in late-fasted seals, but not plasma glycerol. Fasting decreased basal adipose lipase activity by 50%. Fasting also increased plasma lipase activity twofold and decreased the expressions of CD36, FAS, FATP1 and PEPCK-C by 22–43% in adipose tissue. Plasma acylcarnitine profiling indicated that late-fasted seals display higher incomplete LCFA β-oxidation. Results suggest that long-term fasting induces shifts in the regulation of lipolysis and lipid metabolism associated with the onset of insulin resistance in northern elephant seal pups. Delineation of the mechanisms responsible for this shift in regulation during fasting can contribute to a more thorough understanding of the changes in lipid metabolism associated with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in mammals."},{"title":"A unique alkaline pH-regulated and fatty acid-activated tandem pore domain potassium channel (K2P) from a marine sponge","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2435","abstract":"A cDNA encoding a potassium channel of the two-pore domain family (K2P, KCNK) of leak channels was cloned from the marine sponge Amphimedon queenslandica. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that AquK2P cannot be placed into any of the established functional groups of mammalian K2P channels. We used the Xenopus oocyte expression system, a two-electrode voltage clamp and inside-out patch clamp electrophysiology to determine the physiological properties of AquK2P. In whole cells, non-inactivating, voltage-independent, outwardly rectifying K+ currents were generated by external application of micromolar concentrations of arachidonic acid (AA; EC50 ∼30 μmol l–1), when applied in an alkaline solution (≥pH 8.0). Prior activation of channels facilitated the pH-regulated, AA-dependent activation of AquK2P but external pH changes alone did not activate the channels. Unlike certain mammalian fatty-acid-activated K2P channels, the sponge K2P channel was not activated by temperature and was insensitive to osmotically induced membrane distortion. In inside-out patch recordings, alkalinization of the internal pH (pKa 8.18) activated the AquK2P channels independently of AA and also facilitated activation by internally applied AA. The gating of the sponge K2P channel suggests that voltage-independent outward rectification and sensitivity to pH and AA are ancient and fundamental properties of animal K2P channels. In addition, the membrane potential of some poriferan cells may be dynamically regulated by pH and AA."},{"title":"Early developmental gene regulation in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryos in response to elevated CO2 seawater conditions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2445","abstract":"Ocean acidification, or the increased uptake of CO2 by the ocean due to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, may variably impact marine early life history stages, as they may be especially susceptible to changes in ocean chemistry. Investigating the regulatory mechanisms of early development in an environmental context, or ecological development, will contribute to increased understanding of potential organismal responses to such rapid, large-scale environmental changes. We examined transcript-level responses to elevated seawater CO2 during gastrulation and the initiation of spiculogenesis, two crucial developmental processes in the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Embryos were reared at the current, accepted oceanic CO2 concentration of 380 microatmospheres (μatm), and at the elevated levels of 1000 and 1350 μatm, simulating predictions for oceans and upwelling regions, respectively. The seven genes of interest comprised a subset of pathways in the primary mesenchyme cell gene regulatory network (PMC GRN) shown to be necessary for the regulation and execution of gastrulation and spiculogenesis. Of the seven genes, qPCR analysis indicated that elevated CO2 concentrations only had a significant but subtle effect on two genes, one important for early embryo patterning, Wnt8, and the other an integral component in spiculogenesis and biomineralization, SM30b. Protein levels of another spicule matrix component, SM50, demonstrated significant variable responses to elevated CO2. These data link the regulation of crucial early developmental processes with the environment that these embryos would be developing within, situating the study of organismal responses to ocean acidification in a developmental context."},{"title":"Deciphering the signature of cuticular lipids with contact sex pheromone function in a parasitic wasp","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2471","abstract":"The surface of insects is covered by a complex mixture of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to prevent desiccation. In many species these lipids also have communicative functions, but often it is unknown which components are crucial for the behavioural response. Furthermore, it is often ignored that polar lipids also occur on the insects' cuticle and might interact with CHCs. In the parasitic wasp Lariophagus distinguendus, CHCs function as a contact sex pheromone eliciting wing-fanning in males. Interestingly, not only females but also newly emerged males have the pheromone, resulting regularly in homosexual courtship. However, males deactivate the pheromone within the first two days after emergence. This deactivation is accompanied by the disappearance of 3-methylheptacosane (3-MeC27) and some minor components from the CHC profile of males. Here we show that 3-MeC27 is a key component of the contact sex pheromone which, however, triggers courtship behaviour only if an olfactory background of other cuticular lipids is present. Males responded to (S)-3-MeC27 enantioselectively when applied to filter paper but on three-dimensional dummies both enantiomers were behaviourally active, suggesting that physical stimuli also play a role in sexual communication of the wasps. Finally, we report that triacylglycerides (TAGs) are also essential components of the pheromone, and present evidence that TAGs actually occur on the cuticle of L. distinguendus. Our data provide novel insights into the semiochemical function of cuticular lipids by showing that the bioactivity of CHCs may be influenced by the stereochemistry and a synergetic interaction with long time ignored TAGs."},{"title":"Differential expression of genes and proteins between electric organ and skeletal muscle in the mormyrid electric fish Brienomyrus brachyistius","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2479","abstract":"Electric organs (EOs) have evolved independently in vertebrates six times from skeletal muscle (SM). The transcriptional changes accompanying this developmental transformation are not presently well understood. Mormyrids and gymnotiforms are two highly convergent groups of weakly electric fish that have independently evolved EOs: while much is known about development and gene expression in gymnotiforms, very little is known about development and gene expression in mormyrids. This lack of data limits prospects for comparative work. We report here on the characterization of 28 differentially expressed genes between SM and EO tissues in the mormyrid Brienomyrus brachyistius, which were identified using suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH). Forward and reverse SSH was performed on tissue samples of EO and SM resulting in one cDNA library enriched with mRNAs expressed in EO, and a second library representing mRNAs unique to SM. Nineteen expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified in EO and nine were identified in SM using BLAST searching of Danio rerio sequences available in NCBI databases. We confirmed differential expression of all 28 ESTs using RT-PCR. In EO, these ESTs represent four classes of proteins: (1) ion pumps, including the α- and β-subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase, and a plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; (2) Ca2+-binding protein S100, several parvalbumin paralogs, calcyclin-binding protein and neurogranin; (3) sarcomeric proteins troponin I, myosin heavy chain and actin-related protein complex subunit 3 (Arcp3); and (4) the transcription factors enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH) and myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A). Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to demonstrate the translation of seven proteins (myosin heavy chain, Na+/K+-ATPase, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, MEF2, troponin and parvalbumin) and their cellular localization in EO and SM. Our findings suggest that mormyrids express several paralogs of muscle-specific genes and the proteins they encode in EOs, unlike gymnotiforms, which may post-transcriptionally repress several sarcomeric proteins. In spite of the similarity in the physiology and function of EOs in mormyrids and gymnotiforms, this study indicates that the mechanisms of development in the two groups may be considerably different."},{"title":"Isotopic incorporation rates for shark tissues from a long-term captive feeding study","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2495","abstract":"Stable isotope analysis has provided insight into the dietary and habitat patterns of many birds, mammals and teleost fish. A crucial biological parameter to interpret field stable isotope data is tissue incorporation rate, which has not been well studied in large ectotherms. We report the incorporation of carbon and nitrogen into the tissues of leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata). Because sharks have relatively slow metabolic rates and are difficult to maintain in captivity, no long-term feeding study has been conducted until the point of isotopic steady state with a diet. We kept six leopard sharks in captivity for 1250 days, measured their growth, and serially sampled plasma, red blood cells and muscle for stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis. A single-compartment model with first-order kinetics adequately described the incorporation patterns of carbon and nitrogen isotopes for these three tissues. Both carbon and nitrogen were incorporated faster in plasma than in muscle and red blood cells. The rate of incorporation of carbon into muscle was similar to that predicted by an allometric equation relating isotopic incorporation rate to body mass that was developed previously for teleosts. In spite of their large size and unusual physiology, the rates of isotopic incorporation in sharks seem to follow the same patterns found in other aquatic ectotherms."},{"title":"Visual attention in a complex search task differs between honeybees and bumblebees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2515","abstract":"Mechanisms of spatial attention are used when the amount of gathered information exceeds processing capacity. Such mechanisms have been proposed in bees, but have not yet been experimentally demonstrated. We provide evidence that selective attention influences the foraging performance of two social bee species, the honeybee Apis mellifera and the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Visual search tasks, originally developed for application in human psychology, were adapted for behavioural experiments on bees. We examined the impact of distracting visual information on search performance, which we measured as error rate and decision time. We found that bumblebees were significantly less affected by distracting objects than honeybees. Based on the results, we conclude that the search mechanism in honeybees is serial like, whereas in bumblebees it shows the characteristics of a restricted parallel-like search. Furthermore, the bees differed in their strategy to solve the speed–accuracy trade-off. Whereas bumblebees displayed slow but correct decision-making, honeybees exhibited fast and inaccurate decision-making. We propose two neuronal mechanisms of visual information processing that account for the different responses between honeybees and bumblebees, and we correlate species-specific features of the search behaviour to differences in habitat and life history."},{"title":"Blowfly flight characteristics are shaped by environmental features and controlled by optic flow information","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2501","abstract":"Blowfly flight consists of two main components, saccadic turns and intervals of mostly straight gaze direction, although, as a consequence of inertia, flight trajectories usually change direction smoothly. We investigated how flight behavior changes depending on the surroundings and how saccadic turns and intersaccadic translational movements might be controlled in arenas of different width with and without obstacles. Blowflies do not fly in straight trajectories, even when traversing straight flight arenas; rather, they fly in meandering trajectories. Flight speed and the amplitude of meanders increase with arena width. Although saccade duration is largely constant, peak angular velocity and succession into either direction are variable and depend on the visual surroundings. Saccade rate and amplitude also vary with arena layout and are correlated with the ‘time-to-contact’ to the arena wall. We provide evidence that both saccade and velocity control rely to a large extent on the intersaccadic optic flow generated in eye regions looking well in front of the fly, rather than in the lateral visual field, where the optic flow at least during forward flight tends to be strongest."},{"title":"Body size is not critical for critical PO2 in scarabaeid and tenebrionid beetles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2524","abstract":"Constraints on oxygen delivery potentially limit animal body size. Because diffusion rates are highly distance dependent, and because tracheal length increases with size, gas exchange was traditionally thought to be more difficult for larger insects. As yet the effect of body size on critical oxygen partial pressure (Pcrit) has not been measured for any clade of insect species for which there are interspecific data on tracheal scaling. We addressed this deficiency by measuring Pcrit over a 4150-fold mass range (ratio of largest to smallest species mean) of two families of Coleoptera (Tenebrionidae and Scarabaeidae). We exposed adult beetles to progressively lower oxygen levels and measured their ability to maintain CO2 release rates. Absolute metabolic rates increased hypometrically with beetle body mass (M) at both normoxic (M0.748) and hypoxic (M0.846) conditions. Pcrit, however, was independent of body size. Maximum overall conductances for oxygen from air to mitochondria (GO2,max) matched metabolic rates as insects became larger, likely enabling the similar Pcrit values observed in large and small beetles. These data suggest that current atmospheric oxygen levels do not limit body size of insects because of limitations on gas exchange. However, increasing relative investment in the tracheal system in larger insects may produce trade-offs or meet spatial limits that constrain insect size."},{"title":"Temperature dependence of locomotor performance in the tropical clawed frog, Xenopus tropicalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/14/2465","abstract":"Amphibians are ideal taxa with which to investigate the effects of climate change on physiology, dispersal capacity and distributional ranges as their physiological performance and fitness is highly dependent on temperature. Moreover, amphibians are among the most endangered vertebrate taxa. Here we use the tropical clawed frog, Xenopus tropicalis, as a model system to explore effects of temperature on locomotor performance. Our analyses show that locomotion is thermally sensitive, as illustrated by significant effects of temperature on terrestrial exertion capacity (time until exhaustion) and aquatic burst speed (maximal burst swimming velocity and maximal burst swimming acceleration capacity). Exertion performance measures had relatively lower temperature optima and narrower performance breadth ranges than measures of burst speed. The narrow 80% performance breadths confirm predictions that animals from stable environments should display high thermal sensitivity and, combined with the divergent temperature optima for exertion capacity and burst speed, underscore the vulnerability of tropical species such as X. tropicalis to even relatively small temperature changes. The temperature sensitivity of locomotor performance traits in X. tropicalis suggests that tropical ectotherms may be impacted by predicted changes in climate."},{"title":"Flexibility in starting posture drives flexibility in kinematic behavior of the kinethmoid-mediated premaxillary protrusion mechanism in a cyprinid fish, Cyprinus carpio","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2262","abstract":"Premaxillary protrusion in cypriniform fishes involves rotation of the kinethmoid, an unpaired skeletal element in the dorsal midline of the rostrum. No muscles insert directly onto the kinethmoid, so its rotation must be caused by the movement of other bones. In turn, the kinethmoid is thought to push on the ascending processes of the premaxillae, effecting protrusion. To determine the causes and effects of kinethmoid motion, we used XROMM (x-ray reconstruction of moving morphology) to measure the kinematics of cranial bones in common carp, Cyprinus carpio. Mean kinethmoid rotation was 83 deg during premaxillary protrusion (18 events in 3 individuals). The kinethmoid rotates in a coordinated way with ventral translation of the maxillary bridge, and this ventral translation is likely driven primarily by the A1β muscle. Analyses of flexibility (variability between behaviors) and coordination (correlation between bones within a behavior) indicate that motion of the maxillary bridge, not the lower jaw, drives premaxillary protrusion. Thus, upper jaw protrusion is decoupled from lower jaw depression, allowing for two separate modes of protrusion, open mouth and closed mouth. These behaviors serve different functions: to procure food and to sort food, respectively. Variation in starting posture of the maxilla alone dictates which type of protrusion is performed; downstream motions are invariant. For closed mouth protrusion, a ventrally displaced maxillary starting posture causes kinethmoid rotation to produce more ventrally directed premaxillary protrusion. This flexibility, bestowed by the kinethmoid–maxillary bridge–A1β mechanism, one of several evolutionary novelties in the cypriniform feeding mechanism, may have contributed to the impressive trophic diversity that characterizes this speciose lineage."},{"title":"Differential effects of chronic hypoxia and feed restriction on the expression of leptin and its receptor, food intake regulation and the endocrine stress response in common carp","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2273","abstract":"Appetite suppression is a common response to hypoxia in fish that confers significant energy savings. Yet little is known about the endocrine signals involved in the regulation of food intake during chronic hypoxia. Thus, we assessed the impact of chronic hypoxia on food intake, the expression of the potent anorexigenic signal leptin and its receptor (lepr), the mRNA levels of key hypothalamic appetite-regulating genes, and the activity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–interrenal (HPI) axis in common carp, Cyprinus carpio. Fish exposed to 10% O2 saturation for 8 days were chronically anorexic and consumed on average 79% less food than normoxic controls. Hypoxia also elicited gradual and parallel increases in the expression of liver leptin-a-I, leptin-a-II, lepr and erythropoietin, a known hypoxia-responsive gene. In contrast, the liver mRNA levels of all four genes remained unchanged in normoxic fish pair-fed to the hypoxia treatment. In the hypothalamus, expression of the appetite-regulating genes were consistent with an inhibition and stimulation of hunger in the hypoxic and pair-fed fish, respectively, and reduced feed intake led to a decrease in lepr. Although both treatments elicited similar delayed increases in plasma cortisol, they were characterized by distinct HPI axis effector transcript levels and a marked differential increase in pituitary lepr expression. Together, these results show that a reduction in O2 availability, and not feed intake, stimulates liver leptin-a expression in common carp and suggest that this pleiotropic cytokine is involved in the regulation of appetite and the endocrine stress response during chronic hypoxia."},{"title":"The role of elastic energy storage and recovery in downhill and uphill running","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2283","abstract":"In level running, humans and other animals store and recover elastic energy during each step. What role does elastic energy play during downhill and uphill running? We measured the fluctuations of the mechanical energy of the center of mass (CoM) of 15 human participants running at 3 m s–1 on the level, downhill and uphill on a force-measuring treadmill mounted at 3, 6 and 9 deg. In level running, nearly symmetrical decreases and increases of the combined gravitational potential and kinetic (GPE+KE) energy of the CoM indicated equal possible elastic energy storage and recovery. However, asymmetrical fluctuations during hill running indicate reduced maximum possible elastic energy storage and return. We analyzed mechanical energy generation and dissipation during level and hill running by quantifying the anatomically estimated elastic energy storage (AEEE) in the arch and Achilles' tendon using peak ground reaction forces and anatomical characteristics. AEEE did not change with grade. At shallow downhill grades, the body must generate mechanical energy, though it dissipates more than it generates. At steeper downhill grades, little to no energy generation is required and only mechanical energy dissipation must occur. The downhill grade at which mechanical energy must no longer be generated occurs at approximately –9 deg, near the metabolically optimal running grade. At shallow uphill grades, mechanical energy must be generated to raise the CoM, and at steeper grades, additional energy must be generated to offset reduced elastic energy storage and return."},{"title":"How forelimb and hindlimb function changes with incline and perch diameter in the green anole, Anolis carolinensis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2288","abstract":"The range of inclines and perch diameters in arboreal habitats poses a number of functional challenges for locomotion. To effectively overcome these challenges, arboreal lizards execute complex locomotor behaviors involving both the forelimbs and the hindlimbs. However, few studies have examined the role of forelimbs in lizard locomotion. To characterize how the forelimbs and hindlimbs differentially respond to changes in substrate diameter and incline, we obtained three-dimensional high-speed video of green anoles (Anolis carolinensis) running on flat (9 cm wide) and narrow (1.3 cm) perches inclined at 0, 45 and 90 deg. Changes in perch diameter had a greater effect on kinematics than changes in incline, and proximal limb variables were primarily responsible for these kinematic changes. In addition, a number of joint angles exhibited greater excursions on the 45 deg incline compared with the other inclines. Anolis carolinensis adopted strategies to maintain stability similar to those of other arboreal vertebrates, increasing limb flexion, stride frequency and duty factor. However, the humerus and femur exhibited several opposite kinematic trends with changes in perch diameter. Further, the humerus exhibited a greater range of motion than the femur. A combination of anatomy and behavior resulted in differential kinematics between the forelimb and the hindlimb, and also a potential shift in the propulsive mechanism with changes in external demand. This suggests that a better understanding of single limb function comes from an assessment of both forelimbs and hindlimbs. Characterizing forelimb and hindlimb movements may reveal interesting functional differences between Anolis ecomorphs. Investigations into the physiological mechanisms underlying the functional differences between the forelimb and the hindlimb are needed to fully understand how arboreal animals move in complex habitats."},{"title":"Respiratory dynamics of discontinuous gas exchange in the tracheal system of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2301","abstract":"Gas exchange dynamics in insects is of fundamental importance to understanding evolved variation in breathing patterns, such as discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs). Most insects do not rely solely on diffusion for the exchange of respiratory gases but may also make use of respiratory movements (active ventilation) to supplement gas exchange at rest. However, their temporal dynamics have not been widely investigated. Here, intratracheal pressure, VCO2 and body movements of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria were measured simultaneously during the DGC and revealed several important aspects of gas exchange dynamics. First, S. gregaria employs two different ventilatory strategies, one involving dorso-ventral contractions and the other longitudinal telescoping movements. Second, although a true spiracular closed (C)-phase of the DGC could be identified by means of subatmospheric intratracheal pressure recordings, some CO2 continued to be released. Third, strong pumping actions do not necessarily lead to CO2 release and could be used to ensure mixing of gases in the closed tracheal system, or enhance water vapour reabsorption into the haemolymph from fluid-filled tracheole tips by increasing the hydrostatic pressure or forcing fluid into the haemocoel. Finally, this work showed that the C-phase of the DGC can occur at any pressure. These results provide further insights into the mechanistic basis of insect gas exchange."},{"title":"Differences in critical thermal maxima and mortality across life stages of the mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2319","abstract":"Thermal limits to activity profoundly affect the abundance and distribution of ectothermic animals. Upper thermal limits to activity are typically reported as the critical thermal maximum (CTmax), the temperature at which activity becomes uncontrolled. Thermolimit respirometry is a new technique that allows CTmax to be quantified in small animals, such as insects, as the point of spiracular failure by measuring CO2 release from the animal as temperature increases. Although prior studies have reported a characteristic pattern of CO2 release for insects during thermolimit respirometry trials, no studies have been carried out to determine the universality of this pattern across development, or at what point death occurs along this pattern. Here, we compared the CTmax and patterns of CO2 release among three life stages of a beetle species, Tenebrio molitor, and mapped heat death onto these patterns. Our study is the first to report distinct patterns of CO2 release in different life stages of an insect species during thermolimit respirometry. Our results show that CTmax was significantly higher in adult beetles than in either larvae or pupae (P<0.001) and, similarly, death occurred at higher temperatures in adults than in larvae and pupae. We also found that death during heating closely follows CTmax in these animals, which confirms that measuring the loss of spiracular control with thermolimit respirometry successfully identifies the point of physiological limitation during heat stress."},{"title":"Inter-animal variability in the effects of C-type allatostatin on the cardiac neuromuscular system in the lobster Homarus americanus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2308","abstract":"Although the global effects of many modulators on pattern generators are relatively consistent among preparations, modulators can induce different alterations in different preparations. We examined the mechanisms that underlie such variability in the modulatory effects of the peptide C-type allatostatin (C-AST; pQIRYHQCYFNPISCF) on the cardiac neuromuscular system of the lobster Homarus americanus. Perfusion of C-AST through the semi-intact heart consistently decreased the frequency of ongoing contractions. However, the effect of C-AST on contraction amplitude varied between preparations, decreasing in some preparations and increasing in others. To investigate this variable effect, we examined the effects of C-AST both peripherally and centrally. When contractions of the myocardium were elicited by controlled stimuli, C-AST did not alter heart contraction at the periphery (myocardium or neuromuscular junction) in any hearts. However, when applied either to the semi-intact heart or to the cardiac ganglion (CG) isolated from hearts that responded to C-AST with increased contraction force, C-AST increased both motor neuron burst duration and the number of spikes per burst by about 25%. In contrast, CG output was increased only marginally in hearts that responded to C-AST with a decrease in contraction amplitude, suggesting that the decrease in amplitude in those preparations resulted from decreased peripheral facilitation. Our data suggest that the differential effects of a single peptide on the cardiac neuromuscular system are due solely to differential effects of the peptide on the pattern generator; the extent to which the peptide induces increased burst duration is crucial in determining its overall effect on the system."},{"title":"Experience-dependent modulation of antennal sensitivity and input to antennal lobes in male moths (Spodoptera littoralis) pre-exposed to sex pheromone","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2334","abstract":"Sex pheromones are intraspecific olfactory signals emitted by one sex to attract a potential mating partner. Behavioural responses to sex pheromones are generally highly stereotyped. However, they can be modulated by experience, as male moths previously exposed to female sex pheromone respond with a lower threshold upon further detection, even after long delays. Here, we address the question of the neural mechanisms underlying such long-term modulation. As previous work has shown increased responses to pheromone in central olfactory neurons, we asked whether brief exposure to the pheromone increases input activity from olfactory receptor neurons. Males pre-exposed to sex pheromone exhibited increased peripheral sensitivity to the main pheromone component. Among nine antennal genes targeted as putatively involved in pheromone reception, one encoding a pheromone-binding protein showed significant upregulation upon exposure. In the primary olfactory centre (antennal lobe), the neural compartment processing the main pheromone component was enlarged after a brief pheromone exposure, thus suggesting enduring structural changes. We hypothesise that higher peripheral sensitivity following pre-exposure leads to increased input to the antennal lobe, thus contributing to the structural and functional reorganization underlying a stable change in behaviour."},{"title":"Development of cardiovascular function in the marine gastropod Littorina obtusata (Linnaeus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2327","abstract":"The molluscan cardiovascular system typically incorporates a transient extracardiac structure, the larval heart, early in development, but the functional importance of this structure is unclear. We documented the ontogeny and regulatory ability of the larval heart in relation to two other circulatory structures, the true heart and the velum, in the intertidal gastropod Littorina obtusata. There was a mismatch between the appearance of the larval heart and the velum. Velar lobes appeared early in development (day 4), but the larval heart did not begin beating until day 13. The beating of the larval heart reached a maximum on day 17 and then decreased until the structure itself disappeared (day 24). The true heart began to beat on day 17. Its rate of beating increased as that of the larval heart decreased, possibly suggesting a gradual shift from a larval heart-driven to a true heart-driven circulation. The true heart was not sensitive to acutely declining PO2 shortly after it began to beat, but increased in activity in response to acutely declining PO2 by day 21. Larval heart responses were similar to those of the true heart, with early insensitivity to declining PO2 (day 13) followed by a response by day 15. Increased velum-driven rotational activity under acutely declining PO2 was greatest in early developmental stages. Together, these findings point to cardiovascular function in L. obtusata larvae being the result of a complex interaction between velum, larval and true heart activities, with the functions of the three structures coinciding but their relative importance changing throughout larval development."},{"title":"Spectral sensitivity of phototaxis in the dinoflagellate Kryptoperidinium foliaceum and their reaction to physical encounters","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2342","abstract":"The dinoflagellate Kryptoperidinium foliaceum possesses one of the largest eyespots among the autotrophic dinoflagellates. Until now they were believed to be negatively phototactic using a non-opsin photopigment. Here we provide evidence that in newly established cultures they are positively phototactic and that the dynamic range of phototaxis is ∼2.5 log units. Additionally, we find that the spectral sensitivity of the phototaxis agrees reasonably well with the absorption curve of a theoretical opsin, with a peak sensitivity around 500 nm. The sensitivity in the short wavelength end of the tested spectrum is unexpectedly low, but this is probably due to selective filtering. Interestingly, the phototaxis could be temporarily overruled by tactile stimuli. After physical contact with the light guide, the cells escaped the area, and we suggest that this may serve as predator avoidance."},{"title":"Divergence of desiccation-related traits in two Drosophila species of the takahashii subgroup from the western Himalayas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2181","abstract":"Drosophila nepalensis is more abundant under colder and drier montane habitats in the western Himalayas compared with Drosophila takahashii, but the mechanistic basis of such a climatic adaptation is largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that divergence in the physiological basis of desiccation-related traits is consistent with species-specific adaptations to climatic conditions. Drosophila nepalensis showed approximately twofold higher desiccation resistance, hemolymph content as well as carbohydrate content than D. takahashii despite a modest difference in rate of water loss (0.3% h–1). Water loss before succumbing to death (dehydration tolerance) was much higher in D. nepalensis (82.32%) than in D. takahashii (∼50%). A greater loss of hemolymph water under desiccation stress until death is associated with higher desiccation resistance in D. nepalensis. In both species, carbohydrates were utilized under desiccation stress, but a higher level of stored carbohydrates was evident in D. nepalensis. Further, we found increased desiccation resistance in D. nepalensis through acclimation whereas D. takahashii lacked such a response. Thus, species-specific divergence in water-balance-related traits in these species is consistent with their adaptations to wet and dry habitats."},{"title":"Further insight into the sound-producing mechanism of clownfishes: what structure is involved in sound radiation?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2192","abstract":"It was recently demonstrated that clownfishes produce aggressive sounds by snapping their jaw teeth. To date, only the onset of the sound has been studied, which raises the question, what structure is involved in sound radiation? Here, a combination of different approaches has been used to determine the anatomical structure(s) responsible for the size-related variations observed in sound duration and frequency. Filling the swimbladder with physiological liquid specifically modified size-related acoustic features by inducing a significant decrease in pulse duration of approximately 3 ms and a significant increase in dominant frequency of approximately 105 Hz. However, testing the acoustics of the swimbladder by striking it with a piezoelectric impact hammer showed that this structure is a highly damped sound source prevented from prolonged vibrations. In contrast, the resonant properties of the rib cage seems to account for the size-related variations observed in acoustic features. For an equivalent strike on the rib cage, the duration and dominant frequency of induced sounds changed with fish size: sound duration and dominant frequency were positively and negatively correlated with fish size, respectively. Such relationships between sonic features and fish size are consistent with those observed in natural sounds emitted by fish. Therefore, the swimbladder itself does not act as a resonator; its wall just seems to be driven by the oscillations of the rib cage. This set of observations suggests the need for reassessment of the acoustic role of swimbladders in various fish species."},{"title":"Illumination preference, illumination constancy and colour discrimination by bumblebees in an environment with patchy light","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2173","abstract":"Patchy illumination presents foraging animals with a challenge, as the targets being sought may appear to vary in colour depending on the illumination, compromising target identification. We sought to explore how the bumblebee Bombus terrestris copes with tasks involving flower colour discrimination under patchy illumination. Light patches varied between unobscured daylight and leaf-shade, as a bee might encounter in and around woodland. Using a flight arena and coloured filters, as well as one or two different colours of artificial flower, we quantified how bees chose to forage when presented with foraging tasks under patchy illumination. Bees were better at discriminating a pair of similar colours under simulated unobscured daylight illumination than when foraging under leaf-shade illumination. Accordingly, we found that bees with prior experience of simulated daylight but not leaf-shade illumination initially preferred to forage in simulated daylight when all artificial flowers contained rewards as well as when only one colour was rewarding, whereas bees with prior experience of both illuminants did not exhibit this preference. Bees also switched between illuminants less than expected by chance. This means that bees prefer illumination conditions with which they are familiar, and in which rewarding flower colours are easily distinguishable from unrewarding ones. Under patchy illumination, colour discrimination performance was substantially poorer than in homogenous light. The bees' abilities at coping with patchy light may therefore impact on foraging behaviour in the wild, particularly in woodlands, where illumination can change over short spatial scales."},{"title":"Pheromone mediated modulation of pre-flight warm-up behavior in male moths","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2203","abstract":"An essential part of sexual reproduction typically involves the identification of an appropriate mating partner. Males of many moth species utilize the scent of sex pheromones to track and locate conspecific females. However, before males engage in flight, warm-up by shivering of the major flight muscles is necessary to reach a thoracic temperature suitable to sustain flight. Here we show that Helicoverpa zea males exposed to an attractive pheromone blend (and in some instances to the primary pheromone component alone) started shivering earlier and took off at a lower thoracic temperature than moths subjected to other incomplete or unattractive blends. This resulted in less time spent shivering and faster heating rates. Two interesting results emerge from these experiments. First, the rate of heat generation can be modulated by different olfactory cues. Second, males detecting the pheromone blend take off at lower thoracic temperatures than males exposed to other stimuli. The take-off temperature of these males was below that for optimal power production in the flight muscles, thus generating a trade-off between rapid departure and suboptimal flight performance. Our results shed light on thermoregulatory behaviour of unrestrained moths associated with the scramble competition for access to females and suggest ecological trade-offs between rapid flight initiation and sub-optimal flight performance."},{"title":"Survival of heat stress with and without heat hardening in Drosophila melanogaster: interactions with larval density","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2220","abstract":"Survival of a potentially lethal high temperature stress is a genetically variable thermal adaptation trait in many organisms.

Mapping populations were two panels of recombinant inbred lines (RIL), which were previously constructed from heat stress-selected stocks: RIL-D48 and RIL-SH2, derived from backcrosses to stocks of low and high heat resistance, respectively. HSS increased with heat hardening in both LD and HD flies. In addition, HSS increased consistently with density in non-hardened flies. There was a significant interaction between heat hardening and density effects in RIL-D48. Several QTL were significant for both density and hardening treatments. Many QTL overlapped with thermotolerance QTL identified for other traits in previous studies based on LD cultures only. However, three new QTL were found in HD only (cytological ranges: 12E–16F6; 30A3–34C2; 49C–50C).

The song comprises two elements: groups of ca. 10 pulses (chirps) with low fundamental frequency (3.5–3.7 kHz) alternating with high-frequency (15-17 kHz) pulses (ticks) that usually occur as doublets. Some elements of courtship song are quite variable (high coefficient of variation) both within and between males, whereas others are more stereotypical. In experiments with playback of synthesized courtship songs, we studied the importance of several song parameters for mating success, which we evaluated as the probability with which females mounted muted, courting males. Altering some features that show little variability, such as chirp-pulse rate or carrier frequency of ticks, resulted in significant decreases in mounting frequency, consistent with the notion that trait values showing little variability are constrained by stabilizing selection exerted by females. However, alteration of one invariant trait, the occurrence of both song components, by omitting either component from test songs only slightly affected female responsiveness. Alteration of a variable song trait, the number of ticks per song phrase, had no effect on female response rate, thus failing to provide support for the idea that variable traits provide a substrate for sexual selection. An unusual characteristic feature of the song of G. assimilis is that chirp pulses often contain substantial high-frequency power, and indeed may entirely lack power at the fundamental frequency. Playback experiments showed that such songs are, nevertheless, behaviorally effective. To understand the neural basis for this, we recorded the responses of the two principal ascending auditory interneurons of crickets, AN1 and AN2. Our results suggest that the frequency selectivity of the neurons is sufficiently broad to tolerate the spectral variability of courtship chirps."},{"title":"Coordination of bat sonar activity and flight for the exploration of three-dimensional objects","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2226","abstract":"The unique combination of flight and echolocation has opened the nocturnal air space as a rich ecological niche for bats. By analysing echoes of their sonar emissions, bats discriminate and recognize three-dimensional (3-D) objects. However, in contrast to vision, the 3-D information that can be gained by ensonifying an object from only one observation angle is sparse. To date, it is unclear how bats synchronize echolocation and flight activity to explore the 3-D shape of ensonified objects. We have devised an experimental design that allows creating 3-D virtual echo-acoustic objects by generating in real-time echoes from the bat's emissions that depend on the bat's position relative to the virtual object. Bats were trained to evaluate these 3-D virtual objects differing in their azimuthal variation of either echo amplitude or spectral composition. The data show that through a very effective coordination of sonar and flight activity, bats analyse an azimuthal variation of echo amplitude with a resolution of approximately 16 dB and a variation of echo centre frequency of approximately 19%. Control experiments show that the bats can detect not only these variations but also perturbations in the spatial arrangement of these variations. The current experimental paradigm shows that echolocating bats assemble echo-acoustic object information – acquired sequentially in flight – to reconstruct the 3-D shape of the ensonified object. Unlike previous approaches, the recruitment of virtual objects allows for a direct quantification of this reconstruction success in a highly controlled experimental approach."},{"title":"Thicker host tissues moderate light stress in a cnidarian endosymbiont","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2247","abstract":"The susceptibility of algal–cnidarian holobionts to environmental stress is dependent on attributes of both host and symbiont, but the role of the host is often unclear. We examined the influence of the host on symbiont light stress, comparing the photophysiology of the chlorophyte symbiont Elliptochloris marina in two species of sea anemones in the genus Anthopleura. After 3 months of acclimation in outdoor tanks, polyp photoprotective contraction behavior was similar between the two host species, but photochemical efficiency was 1.5 times higher in A. xanthogrammica than in A. elegantissima. Maximum relative electron transport rates, derived from rapid light curves, were 1.5 times higher in A. xanthogrammica than in A. elegantissima when symbionts were inside intact tissues, but were not significantly different between host species upon removal of outer (epidermis and mesoglea) tissue layers from symbiont-containing gastrodermal cells. Tissues of A. xanthogrammica were 1.8 times thicker than those of A. elegantissima, with outer tissue layers attenuating 1.6 times more light. We found no significant differences in light absorption properties per unit volume of tissue, confirming the direct effect of tissue thickness on light attenuation. The thicker tissues of A. xanthogrammica thus provide a favorable environment for E. marina – a relatively stress-susceptible symbiont – and may explain its higher prevalence and expanded range in A. xanthogrammica along the Pacific coast of North America. Our findings also support a photoprotective role for thicker host tissues in reef corals that has long been thought to influence variability in bleaching susceptibility among coral taxa."},{"title":"The discerning predator: decision rules underlying prey classification by a mosquito-eating jumping spider","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2255","abstract":"Evarcha culicivora is an East African jumping spider that feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by choosing blood-fed female Anopheles mosquitoes as prey. Previous studies have shown that this predator can identify its preferred prey even when restricted to using only visual cues. Here, we used lures and virtual mosquitoes to investigate the optical cues underlying this predator's prey-choice behaviour. We made lures by dissecting and then reconstructing dead mosquitoes, combining the head plus thorax with different abdomens. Depending on the experiment, lures were either moving or motionless. Findings from the lure experiments suggested that, for E. culicivora, seeing a blood-fed female mosquito's abdomen on a lure was a necessary, but not sufficient, cue by which preferred prey was identified, as cues from the abdomen needed to be paired with cues from the head and thorax of a mosquito. Conversely, when abdomens were not visible or were identical, spiders based their decisions on the appearance of the head plus thorax of mosquitoes, choosing prey with female characteristics. Findings from a subsequent experiment using animated 3D virtual mosquitoes suggest that it is specifically the mosquito's antennae that influence E. culicivora's prey-choice decisions. Our results show that E. culicivora uses a complex process for prey classification."},{"title":"Hibernation energetics of free-ranging little brown bats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2141","abstract":"Hibernation physiology and energy expenditure have been relatively well studied in large captive hibernators, especially rodents, but data from smaller, free-ranging hibernators are sparse. We examined variation in the hibernation patterns of free-ranging little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) using temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. First, we aimed to test the hypothesis that age, sex and body condition affect expression of torpor and energy expenditure during hibernation. Second, we examined skin temperature to assess whether qualitative differences in the thermal properties of the hibernacula of bats, compared with the burrows of hibernating rodents, might lead to different patterns of torpor and arousal for bats. We also evaluated the impact of carrying transmitters on body condition to help determine the potential impact of telemetry studies. We observed large variation in the duration of torpor bouts within and between individuals but detected no effect of age, sex or body condition on torpor expression or estimates of energy expenditure. We observed the use of shallow torpor in the midst of periodic arousals, which may represent a unique adaptation of bats for conservation of energy during the most costly phase of hibernation. There was no difference in the body condition of hibernating bats outfitted with transmitters compared with that of control bats captured from the same hibernaculum at the same time. This study provides new information on the energetics of hibernation in an under-represented taxon and baseline data important for understanding how white-nose syndrome, a new disease devastating populations of hibernating bats in North America, may alter the expression of hibernation in affected bats."},{"title":"Flexibility in thermoregulatory physiology of two dunnarts, Sminthopsis macroura and Sminthopsis ooldea (Marsupialia; Dasyuridae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/13/2236","abstract":"Stripe-faced dunnarts (Sminthopsis macroura) and Ooldea dunnarts (S. ooldea) were acclimated for 2 weeks to ambient temperature (Ta) regimes of 12–22°C, 18–28°C and 25–35°C, and then measured for standard, basal (BMR) and maximum (MMR) metabolic rate using flow-through respirometry. Sminthopsis macroura maintained a stable body temperature under all experimental Ta and acclimation regimes. Although its BMR was not statistically different between the three acclimation regimes, the lower end of the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) shifted from 30°C under the 18–28°C and 12–22°C acclimation regimes to 35°C under the 25–35°C acclimation regime. MMR increased significantly at the cooler acclimation regimes. EWL increased at Ta=35°C, compared with lower Ta, in all acclimation regimes, but an increase in evaporative water loss (EWL) at Ta=10°C observed in cool acclimations did not occur at the 25–35°C regime. In contrast, S. ooldea had variable body temperature between experimental Ta in all acclimation regimes, but no acclimational shift in TNZ, which was between 30 and 35°C. Neither BMR nor MMR was affected by exposure to the three acclimation regimes. EWL did not change across Ta or with acclimation regime. Sminthopsis macroura was flexible in many aspects of its thermoregulation (involving energy and water balance) in response to thermal acclimation, presumably allowing it to balance its energy and water requirements over a broad range of climatic conditions. Sminthopsis ooldea seems to have an inflexible energetic and water balance in response to thermal acclimation, but has low nominal expenditure of either resource on thermoregulation because it thermoregulates less precisely than S. macroura. It seems that S. ooldea is adapted to a more narrow, stable climate."},{"title":"New insights into force depression in skeletal muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2135","abstract":"Force depression observed following active shortening is not well understood. Previous research suggested that force depression might be associated with a stress-induced inhibition of cross-bridges in the newly formed overlap zone following shortening. Our aim was to investigate this theory in skinned fibres and determine whether there was an inhibition of the attachment of cross-bridges or a decrease in the force produced per cross-bridge. The stress-induced inhibition of cross-bridge theory gives testable predictions, including: (1) skinned fibres should show proportional force and stiffness depression, (2) force after shortening should not be lower than force before shortening, (3) stiffness following shortening should not be lower than stiffness before shortening and (4) force depression should decrease when the stress during shortening is decreased. In agreement with these predictions, force and stiffness depression were approximately proportional, and force depression decreased with decreasing stress during shortening. However, in contrast to the predictions of the stress-induced inhibition of cross-bridge theory, force after shortening from sarcomere lengths of 2.8 and 3.0 μm to a sarcomere length of 2.4 μm was smaller than force before shortening, and this was not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in stiffness. We conclude that the stress-induced inhibition of cross-bridge theory, as proposed previously, cannot be the only mechanism for force depression, but that there is an additional, stress-induced inhibition of cross-bridges in the old overlap zone. Furthermore, both mechanisms, inhibition of cross-bridge attachment and reduction of force produced per cross-bridge, contribute to force depression. Inhibition and/or reduction of force depend(s) on the amount of stress imposed on actin during the shortening phase."},{"title":"Skeletal muscles of hibernating brown bears are unusually resistant to effects of denervation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2081","abstract":"Hibernating bears retain most of their skeletal muscle strength despite drastically reduced weight-bearing activity. Regular neural activation of muscles is a potential mechanism by which muscle atrophy could be limited. However, both mechanical loading and neural activity are usually necessary to maintain muscle size. An alternative mechanism is that the signaling pathways related to the regulation of muscle size could be altered so that neither mechanical nor neural inputs are needed for retaining strength. More specifically, we hypothesized that muscles in hibernating bears are resistant to a severe reduction in neural activation. To test this hypothesis, we unilaterally transected the common peroneal nerve, which innervates ankle flexor muscles, in hibernating and summer-active brown bears (Ursus arctos). In hibernating bears, the long digital extensor (LDE) and cranial tibial (CT) musculotendon masses on the denervated side decreased after 11 weeks post-surgery by 18±11 and 25±10%, respectively, compared with those in the intact side. In contrast, decreases in musculotendon masses of summer-active bears after denervation were 61±4 and 58±5% in the LDE and CT, respectively, and significantly different from those of hibernating bears. The decrease due to denervation in summer-active bears was comparable to that occurring in other mammals. Whole-muscle cross-sectional areas (CSAs) measured from ultrasound images and myofiber CSAs measured from biopsies decreased similarly to musculotendon mass. Thus, hibernating bears alter skeletal muscle catabolic pathways regulated by neural activity, and exploration of these pathways may offer potential solutions for disuse atrophy of muscles."},{"title":"Short-term anoxic conditioning hormesis boosts antioxidant defenses, lowers oxidative damage following irradiation and enhances male sexual performance in the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2150","abstract":"Most organisms are repeatedly exposed to oxidative stress from multiple sources throughout their lifetimes, potentially affecting all aspects of organismal performance. Here we test whether exposure to a conditioning bout of anoxia early in adulthood induces a hormetic response that confers resistance to oxidative stress and enhances male sexual performance later in life in the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa. Anoxic conditioning of adults prior to emergence led to an increase in antioxidant capacity driven by mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. When exposed to gamma irradiation, a strong oxidative stressor, males that received anoxic conditioning had lower lipid and protein oxidative damage at sexual maturity. Anoxia conditioning led to greater male sexual competitiveness compared with unconditioned males when both were irradiated, although there was no effect of anoxia conditioning on mating competitiveness in unirradiated males. Anoxia also led to higher adult emergence rates and greater flight ability in irradiation-stressed flies while preserving sterility. Thus, hormetic treatments that increased antioxidant enzyme activity also improved male performance after irradiation, suggesting that antioxidant enzymes play an important role in mediating the relationship between oxidative stress and sexual selection. Furthermore, our work has important applied implications for the sterile insect technique (SIT), an environmentally friendly method of insect pest control where males are sterilized by irradiation and deployed in the field to disrupt pest populations via mating. We suggest that hormetic treatments specifically designed to enhance antioxidant activity may produce more sexually competitive sterile males, thus improving the efficacy and economy of SIT programs."},{"title":"Perch diameter and branching patterns have interactive effects on the locomotion and path choice of anole lizards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2096","abstract":"Natural branches vary conspicuously in their diameter, density and orientation, but how these latter two factors affect animal locomotion is poorly understood. Thus, for three species of arboreal anole lizards found on different size branches and with different limb lengths, we tested sprinting performance on cylinders with five diameters (5–100 mm) and five patterns of pegs, which simulated different branch orientations and spacing. We also tested whether the lizards preferred surfaces that enhanced their performance. The overall responses to different surfaces were similar among the three species, although the magnitude of the effects differed. All species were faster on cylinders with larger diameter and no pegs along the top. The short-limbed species was the slowest on all surfaces. Much of the variation in performance resulted from variable amounts of pausing among different surfaces and species. Lizards preferred to run along the top of cylinders, but pegs along the top of the narrow cylinders interfered with this. Pegs on top of the 100-mm diameter cylinder, however, had little effect on speed as the lizards ran quite a straight path alongside pegs without bumping into them. All three species usually chose surfaces with greater diameters and fewer pegs, but very large diameters with pegs were preferred to much smaller diameter cylinders without pegs. Our results suggest that preferring larger diameters in natural vegetation has a direct benefit for speed and an added benefit of allowing detouring around branches with little adverse effect on speed."},{"title":"An unusual myosuppressin from the blood-feeding bug Rhodnius prolixus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2088","abstract":"The myosuppressin (MS) gene was cloned from a central nervous system (CNS) cDNA library of the hematophagous insect Rhodnius prolixus and is predicted to contain two introns and three exons. The mRNA transcribed from the myosuppressin gene encodes an 88 amino acid prepropeptide, which results in a mature decapeptide after post-translational modification. When compared with the myosuppressins isolated from other insects, the R. prolixus myosuppressin has a unique amino acid sequence (pQDIDHVFMRFamide), with isoleucine (I) in position 3 and methionine (M) in position 8. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR shows that Rhopr-MS is expressed in the CNS and posterior midgut in R. prolixus and immunohistochemistry suggests that an RFamide-like peptide is present in endocrine-like cells in the midgut. Physiological assays using Rhopr-MS indicate that, despite the unusual M at position 8, it still retains myoinhibitory activity, inhibiting the frequency and reducing the amplitude of contractions in the anterior midgut and hindgut, and decreasing heart rate."},{"title":"Targeting a neuropeptide to discrete regions of the motor arborizations of a single neuron","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2108","abstract":"The heart excitor (HE) motor neuron in the leech Hirudo releases acetylcholine (ACh) and a peptide, FMRFamide, to regulate the contractile activity of the heart tube and associated side vessels. Consistent with Dale's principle, it was assumed that both neurotransmitters were localized to all presynaptic varicosities. However, we found discrete peptide-positive and peptide-negative varicosities associated with particular sites of innervation on the heart tube. We produced dual-labeled HE neurons by pressure injecting Neurobiotin into single HE cell bodies and applied anti-FMRFamide antibodies on the same preparations. Consistent with initial expectations, peptide-labeled varicosities were numerous and widely distributed along the heart tube and at one of the three side vessels, the latero-abdominal vessel. Nevertheless, some Neurobiotin-labeled varicosities along the heart tube lacked peptide label entirely. Moreover, there were dense and distinct peptide-negative innervations at the valve junctions of the latero-dorsal and latero-lateral vessels at each segment. Nevertheless, the peptide label was found in HE axons and varicosities that projected distally along the side vessels. Therefore, the more proximal peptide-negative clusters cannot simply be the result of restricted transport or deficient staining of peptide. Rather, we infer that FMRFamide is transported to (or selectively excluded from) discrete locations and that ACh is present in varicosities that lacked peptide. Such targeting of neurotransmitters could be described using a discrete targeting model of synaptic transmission. Compared with Dale's principle, this model may provide a more complete perspective of chemical communication than previously understood."},{"title":"High e-vector acuity in the polarisation vision system of the fiddler crab Uca vomeris","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2128","abstract":"Polarisation vision is used by a variety of species in many important tasks, including navigation and orientation (e.g. desert ant), communication and signalling (e.g. stomatopod crustaceans), and as a possible substitute for colour vision (e.g. cephalopod molluscs).

Yet little is known about the capabilities of their polarisation sense. A modified polarisation-only liquid crystal display and a spherical rotating treadmill were combined to test the responses of fiddler crabs to moving polarisation stimuli. The species Uca vomeris was found to be highly sensitive to polarised light and detected stimuli differing in e-vector angle by as little as 3.2 deg. This represents the most acute behavioural sensitivity to polarised light yet measured for a crustacean. The occurrence of null points in their discrimination curve indicates that this species employs an orthogonal (horizontal/vertical) receptor array for the detection of polarised light."},{"title":"A nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist affects honey bee sucrose responsiveness and decreases waggle dancing","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2022","abstract":"A nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, imidacloprid, impairs memory formation in honey bees and has general effects on foraging. However, little is known about how this agonist affects two specific aspects of foraging: sucrose responsiveness (SR) and waggle dancing (which recruits nestmates). Using lab and field experiments, we tested the effect of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on (1) bee SR with the proboscis extension response assay, and (2) free-flying foragers visiting and dancing for a sucrose feeder. Bees that ingested imidacloprid (0.21 or 2.16 ng bee–1) had higher sucrose response thresholds 1 h after treatment. Foragers that ingested imidacloprid also produced significantly fewer waggle dance circuits (10.5- and 4.5-fold fewer for 50% and 30% sucrose solutions, respectively) 24 h after treatment as compared with controls. However, there was no significant effect of imidacloprid on the sucrose concentrations that foragers collected at a feeder 24 h after treatment. Thus, imidacloprid temporarily increased the minimum sucrose concentration that foragers would accept (short time scale, 1 h after treatment) and reduced waggle dancing (longer time scale, 24 h after treatment). The effect of time suggests different neurological effects of imidacloprid resulting from the parent compound and its metabolites. Waggle dancing can significantly increase colony food intake, and thus a sublethal dose (0.21 ng bee–1, 24 p.p.b.) of this commonly used pesticide may impair colony fitness."},{"title":"A test of the validity of range of motion studies of fossil archosaur elbow mobility using repeated-measures analysis and the extant phylogenetic bracket","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2030","abstract":"Recent studies have presented range of motion (ROM) data in degrees for dinosaur forelimb joints, usually via physical manipulation of one individual. Using these data, researchers have inferred limb orientations, postures, gaits, ecological functions and even phylogenetic trends within clades. However, important areas of concern remain unaddressed; for example, how does ROM at a forelimb joint change after soft tissues are lost in archosaurs? And are fossil ROM methodologies amenable to reproducibility and statistical analysis? Here, we investigated these questions using the extant phylogenetic bracket of dinosaurs. Repeated measures of elbow joint ROM from Struthio camelus and Alligator mississippiensis forelimbs were statistically analyzed as they were sequentially dissected through five levels of tissue removal treatment. Our data indicate that there are no statistically significant differences in repeated measures of ROM between observers who use the same techniques. Extrinsic soft tissues, such as integument, muscles and ligaments were found to impede ROM at the elbow joint. Intrinsic soft tissues, such as articular cartilage, may increase ROM. The hypothesis that the articular surfaces of the bones within the elbow joints of archosaurs provide a general approximation of mobility is supported. Final ROMs were less than the initial ROMs in both taxa, which suggests that prior reports of elbow joint ROMs in degrees for nonavian dinosaurs may represent conservative estimates. We conclude that if observer bias and other variables are controlled for, ROM studies of fossil archosaur limbs can obtain useful degree data for inferring joint mobility in vivo."},{"title":"Birds achieve high robustness in uneven terrain through active control of landing conditions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2117","abstract":"We understand little about how animals adjust locomotor behaviour to negotiate uneven terrain. The mechanical demands and constraints of such behaviours likely differ from uniform terrain locomotion. Here we investigated how common pheasants negotiate visible obstacles with heights from 10 to 50% of leg length. Our goal was to determine the neuro-mechanical strategies used to achieve robust stability, and address whether strategies vary with obstacle height. We found that control of landing conditions was crucial for minimising fluctuations in stance leg loading and work in uneven terrain. Variation in touchdown leg angle (θTD) was correlated with the orientation of ground force during stance, and the angle between the leg and body velocity vector at touchdown (βTD) was correlated with net limb work. Pheasants actively targeted obstacles to control body velocity and leg posture at touchdown to achieve nearly steady dynamics on the obstacle step. In the approach step to an obstacle, the birds produced net positive limb work to launch themselves upward. On the obstacle, body dynamics were similar to uniform terrain. Pheasants also increased swing leg retraction velocity during obstacle negotiation, which we suggest is an active strategy to minimise fluctuations in peak force and leg posture in uneven terrain. Thus, pheasants appear to achieve robustly stable locomotion through a combination of path planning using visual feedback and active adjustment of leg swing dynamics to control landing conditions. We suggest that strategies for robust stability are context specific, depending on the quality of sensory feedback available, especially visual input."},{"title":"Seasonal variation in metabolic rate, flight activity and body size of Anopheles gambiae in the Sahel","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2013","abstract":"Malaria in Africa is vectored primarily by the Anopheles gambiae complex. Although the mechanisms of population persistence during the dry season are not yet known, targeting dry season mosquitoes could provide opportunities for vector control. In the Sahel, it appears likely that M-form A. gambiae survive by aestivation (entering a dormant state). To assess the role of eco-physiological changes associated with dry season survival, we measured body size, flight activity and metabolic rate of wild-caught mosquitoes throughout 1 year in a Sahelian locality, far from permanent water sources, and at a riparian location adjacent to the Niger River. We found significant seasonal variation in body size at both the Sahelian and riparian sites, although the magnitude of the variation was greater in the Sahel. For flight activity, significant seasonality was only observed in the Sahel, with increased flight activity in the wet season when compared with that just prior to and throughout the dry season. Whole-organism metabolic rate was affected by numerous biotic and abiotic factors, and a significant seasonal component was found at both locations. However, assay temperature accounted completely for seasonality at the riparian location, while significant seasonal variation remained after accounting for all measured variables in the Sahel. Interestingly, we did not find that mean metabolic rate was lowest during the dry season at either location, contrary to our expectation that mosquitoes would conserve energy and increase longevity by reducing metabolism during this time. These results indicate that mosquitoes may use mechanisms besides reduced metabolic rate to enable survival during the Sahelian dry season."},{"title":"Flexural stiffness and composition of the batoid propterygium as predictors of punting ability","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2003","abstract":"Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) perform at the extremes of locomotion and feeding (i.e. long migrations, high-speed swimming and durophagy). However, very little is known about their cartilaginous skeletal structure and composition in response to loading regimes. In this study, we investigated a batoid (skate and ray) appendicular skeletal element, the propterygium, and its response to forces experienced during punting (benthic pelvic fin locomotion). Punting places a flexural load on this thin, rod-like element. The goals for our study were to determine: (1) the mechanical and compositional properties of the propterygium and (2) whether these properties correlate with punting ability. Using five batoid species of varying punting ability, we employed a three-point bending test and found that propterygium flexural stiffness (33.74–180.16 Nm2) was similar to values found in bone and could predict punting ability. Variation in flexural stiffness resulted from differences in mineral content (24.4–48.9% dry mass) and the second moment of area. Propterygia material stiffness (140–2533 MPa) approached the lower limit of bone despite having less than one-third of its mineral content. This drastically lower mineral content is reflected in the radius-to-thickness ratio of the cross-section (mean ± s.e.m.=5.5±0.44), which is comparatively much higher than bony vertebrates. This indicates that elasmobranchs may have evolved skeletal elements that increase buoyancy without sacrificing mechanical properties. Our results highlight the functional parallels between a cartilaginous and bony skeleton despite dramatic compositional differences, and provide insight into how environmental factors may affect cartilaginous skeletal development."},{"title":"Central ventilatory and cardiovascular actions of calcitonin gene-related peptide in unanesthetized trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1930","abstract":"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its receptors are widely distributed in the tissues of teleost fish, including the brain, but little is known about the ventilatory and cardiovascular effects of the peptide in these vertebrates. The present study was undertaken to compare the central and peripheral actions of graded doses (5–50 pmol) of trout CGRP on ventilatory and cardiovascular variables in unanesthetized rainbow trout. Compared with vehicle, intracerebroventricular injection of CGRP significantly elevated the ventilation frequency (fV) and the ventilation amplitude (VAMP) and, consequently, the total ventilation (VTOT). The maximum hyperventilatory effect of CGRP (VTOT: +300%), observed at a dose of 50 pmol, was mostly due to its stimulatory action on VAMP (+200%) rather than fV (+30%). In addition, CGRP produced a significant and dose-dependent increase in mean dorsal aortic blood pressure (PDA) (50 pmol: +40%) but the increase in heart rate (fH) was not significant. Intra-arterial injections of CGRP were without effect on the ventilatory variables but significantly and dose-dependently elevated PDA (50 pmol: +36%) without changing fH. At the highest dose tested, this hypertensive phase was preceded by a rapid and transient hypotensive response. In conclusion, our study suggests that endogenous CGRP within the brain of the trout may act as a potent neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator in the regulation of cardio-ventilatory functions. In the periphery, endogenous CGRP may act as a local and/or circulating hormone preferentially involved in vasoregulatory mechanisms."},{"title":"Inducible tolerance to dietary protease inhibitors in Daphnia magna","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2051","abstract":"Daphnia has been shown to acquire tolerance to cyanobacterial toxins within an animals' lifetime and to transfer this tolerance to the next generation. Here we used a strain of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa, which contained two chymotrypsin inhibitors (BN920 and CP954), the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus as reference food and a clone of D. magna to investigate the physiological mechanism of acquired tolerance to these cyanobacterial toxins. The intracellular concentrations of CP954 and BN920 were 1550 and 120 μmol l–1, respectively. When food suspensions of the green alga contained >60% M. aeruginosa, growth rates of D. magna were reduced. When grown on the green alga, three chymotrypsins ranging in mass from 16 to 22 kDa were distinguished in D. magna. Purified BN920 and CP954 specifically inhibited D. magna chymotrypsins. Feeding with encapsulated BN920 resulted in growth depression in D. magna and replacement of the chymotrypsins by three chymotrypsins with smaller molecular mass. With just 20% M. aeruginosa, the same changes in the chymotrypsin pattern as with the pure inhibitor were observed. IC50 values for inhibition of chymotrypsins of D. magna growing on the green alga were 5.4 nmol l–1 (BN920) and 7.4 nmol l–1 (CP954). When D. magna was grown on 20% M. aeruginosa, 2.2-fold higher IC50 values were observed. This indicated that increased tolerance to these dietary inhibitors was acquired within an animal's lifetime by remodelling the digestive chymotrypsins, which in turn serves as an intra-generational defence against these cyanobacterial inhibitors. This mechanism might be relevant for the transfer of tolerance to the next generation through maternal effects."},{"title":"Mitochondrial function in sparrow pectoralis muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2039","abstract":"Flying birds couple a high daily energy turnover with double-digit millimolar blood glucose concentrations and insulin resistance. Unlike mammalian muscle, flight muscle predominantly relies on lipid oxidation during locomotion at high fractions of aerobic capacity, and birds outlive mammals of similar body mass by a factor of three or more. Despite these intriguing functional differences, few data are available comparing fuel oxidation and free radical production in avian and mammalian skeletal muscle mitochondria. Thus we isolated mitochondria from English sparrow pectoralis and rat mixed hindlimb muscles. Maximal O2 consumption and net H2O2 release were measured in the presence of several oxidative substrate combinations. Additionally, NAD- and FAD-linked electron transport chain (ETC) capacity was examined in sonicated mitochondria. Sparrow mitochondria oxidized palmitoyl-l-carnitine 1.9-fold faster than rat mitochondria and could not oxidize glycerol-3-phosphate, while both species oxidized pyruvate, glutamate and malate–aspartate shuttle substrates at similar rates. Net H2O2 release was not significantly different between species and was highest when glycolytic substrates were oxidized. Sonicated sparrow mitochondria oxidized NADH and succinate over 1.8 times faster than rat mitochondria. The high ETC catalytic potential relative to matrix substrate dehydrogenases in sparrow mitochondria suggests a lower matrix redox potential is necessary to drive a given O2 consumption rate. This may contribute to preferential reliance on lipid oxidation, which may result in lower in vivo reactive oxygen species production in birds compared with mammals."},{"title":"Muscular strategy shift in human running: dependence of running speed on hip and ankle muscle performance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1944","abstract":"Humans run faster by increasing a combination of stride length and stride frequency. In slow and medium-paced running, stride length is increased by exerting larger support forces during ground contact, whereas in fast running and sprinting, stride frequency is increased by swinging the legs more rapidly through the air. Many studies have investigated the mechanics of human running, yet little is known about how the individual leg muscles accelerate the joints and centre of mass during this task. The aim of this study was to describe and explain the synergistic actions of the individual leg muscles over a wide range of running speeds, from slow running to maximal sprinting. Experimental gait data from nine subjects were combined with a detailed computer model of the musculoskeletal system to determine the forces developed by the leg muscles at different running speeds. For speeds up to 7 m s–1, the ankle plantarflexors, soleus and gastrocnemius, contributed most significantly to vertical support forces and hence increases in stride length. At speeds greater than 7 m s–1, these muscles shortened at relatively high velocities and had less time to generate the forces needed for support. Thus, above 7 m s–1, the strategy used to increase running speed shifted to the goal of increasing stride frequency. The hip muscles, primarily the iliopsoas, gluteus maximus and hamstrings, achieved this goal by accelerating the hip and knee joints more vigorously during swing. These findings provide insight into the strategies used by the leg muscles to maximise running performance and have implications for the design of athletic training programs."},{"title":"Feeding in the dark: lateral-line-mediated prey detection in the peacock cichlid Aulonocara stuartgranti","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2060","abstract":"The cranial lateral line canal system of teleost fishes is morphologically diverse and is characterized by four patterns. One of these, widened lateral line canals, has evolved convergently in a wide range of teleosts, including the Lake Malawi peacock cichlids (Aulonocara), and has been attributed to its role in prey detection. The ability to study Aulonocara in the laboratory provides an opportunity to test the hypothesis that their reported ability to feed on invertebrate prey living in sandy substrates in their natural habitat is the result of lateral-line-mediated prey detection. The goal of this study was to determine whether Aulonocara stuartgranti could detect hydrodynamic stimuli generated by tethered brine shrimp (visualized using digital particle image velocimetry) under light and dark conditions, with and without treatment with cobalt chloride, which is known to temporarily inactivate the lateral line system. Fish were presented with six pairs of tethered live and dead adult brine shrimp and feeding behavior was recorded with HD digital video. Results demonstrate that A. stuartgranti: (1) uses the same swimming/feeding strategy as they do in the field; (2) detects and consumes invertebrate prey in the dark using its lateral line system; (3) alters prey detection behavior when feeding on the same prey under light and dark conditions, suggesting the involvement of multiple sensory modalities; and (4) after treatment with cobalt chloride, exhibits a reduction in their ability to detect hydrodynamic stimuli produced by prey, especially in the dark, thus demonstrating the role of the lateral line system in prey detection."},{"title":"Respiratory properties of blood in the harbor porpoise, Phocoena phocoena","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1938","abstract":"Harbor porpoises are active divers that exchange O2 and CO2 with the environment during a fast single breath upon surfacing. We investigated blood O2-transporting properties, buffer characteristics, Cl– transport via the erythrocyte anion exchanger (AE1), circulating nitric oxide metabolites and hemoglobin nitrite reduction in harbor porpoises with the aim to evaluate traits that are adaptive for diving behavior. Blood O2 affinity was higher in harbor porpoises than in similar sized terrestrial mammals, as supported by our parallel recordings of O2 equilibria in sheep and pig blood. Further, O2 affinity tended to increase with increasing body mass. A high O2 affinity favors O2 extraction from the lungs, but a normal Bohr effect (ΔlogP50/ΔpH=–0.46) gradually lowers O2 affinity during dives (where CO2 accumulates) to assist O2 off-loading to perfused tissues. The true plasma non-bicarbonate buffer value was moderately higher than in terrestrial mammals and increased upon deoxygenation. Plasma bicarbonate was also relatively high, contributing to increase the overall buffer capacity. The apparent Cl– permeability of harbor porpoise erythrocytes was similar to the human value at 37°C, showing absence of a comparative increase in the velocity of erythrocyte HCO –3/Cl– exchange to aid CO2 excretion. The Q10 for AE1-mediated Cl– transport in harbor porpoises was lower than in humans and seemed to match the Q10 for metabolism (Q10≈2). Plasma nitrite, plasma nitrate and hemoglobin-mediated nitrite reduction were elevated compared with mammalian standards, suggesting that increased nitric oxide bioavailability and nitrite-derived nitric oxide could play important roles in diving physiology."},{"title":"Aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in oxygen minimum layer fishes: the role of alcohol dehydrogenase","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1905","abstract":"Zones of minimum oxygen form at intermediate depth in all the world’s oceans as a result of global circulation patterns that keep the water at oceanic mid-depths out of contact with the atmosphere for hundreds of years. In areas where primary production is very high, the microbial oxidation of sinking organic matter results in very low oxygen concentrations at mid-depths. Such is the case with the Arabian Sea, with O2 concentrations reaching zero at 200 m and remaining very low (<0.1 ml O2 l–1) for hundreds of meters below this depth, and in the California borderland, where oxygen levels reach 0.2 ml O2 l–1 at 700 m with severely hypoxic (<1.0 ml O2 l–1) waters at depths 300 m above and below that. Despite the very low oxygen, mesopelagic fishes (primarily lanternfishes: Mytophidae) inhabiting the Arabian Sea and California borderland perform a daily vertical migration into the low-oxygen layer, spending daylight hours in the oxygen minimum zone and migrating upward into normoxic waters at night. To find out how fishes were able to survive their daily sojourns into the minimum zone, we tested the activity of four enzymes, one (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) that served as a proxy for anaerobic glycolysis with a conventional lactate endpoint, a second (citrate synthase, CS) that is indicative of aerobic metabolism, a third (malate dehydrogenase) that functions in the Krebs’ cycle and as a bridge linking mitochondrion and cytosol, and a fourth (alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH) that catalyzes the final reaction in a pathway where pyruvate is reduced to ethanol. Ethanol is a metabolic product easily excreted by fish, preventing lactate accumulation. The ADH pathway is rarely very active in vertebrate muscle; activity has previously been seen only in goldfish and other cyprinids capable of prolonged anaerobiosis. Activity of the enzyme suite in Arabian Sea and California fishes was compared with that of ecological analogs in the same family and with the same lifestyle but living in systems with much higher oxygen concentrations: the Gulf of Mexico and the Southern Ocean. ADH activities in the Arabian Sea fishes were similar to those of goldfish, far higher than those of confamilials from the less severe minimum in the Gulf of Mexico, suggesting that the Arabian Sea fishes are capable of exploiting the novel ethanol endpoint to become competent anaerobes. In turn, the fishes of California exhibited a higher ADH activity than their Antarctic relatives. It was concluded that ADH activity is more widespread in fishes than previously believed and that it may play a role in allowing vertically migrating fishes to exploit the safe haven afforded by severe oxygen minima."},{"title":"Getting around when you’re round: quantitative analysis of the locomotion of the blunt-spined brittle star, Ophiocoma echinata","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1923","abstract":"Brittle stars (Ophiuroidea, Echinodermata) are pentaradially symmetrical echinoderms that use five multi-jointed limbs to locomote along the seafloor. Prior qualitative descriptions have claimed coordinated movements of the limbs in a manner similar to tetrapod vertebrates, but this has not been evaluated quantitatively. It is uncertain whether the ring-shaped nervous system, which lacks an anatomically defined anterior, is capable of generating rhythmic coordinated movements of multiple limbs. This study tested whether brittle stars possess distinct locomotor modes with strong inter-limb coordination as seen in limbed animals in other phyla (e.g. tetrapods and arthropods), or instead move each limb independently according to local sensory feedback. Limb tips and the body disk were digitized for 56 cycles from 13 individuals moving across sand. Despite their pentaradial anatomy, all individuals were functionally bilateral, moving along the axis of a central limb via synchronous motions of contralateral limbs (±∼13% phase lag). Two locomotor modes were observed, distinguishable mainly by whether the central limb was directed forwards or backwards. Turning was accomplished without rotation of the body disk by defining a different limb as the center limb and shifting other limb identities correspondingly, and then continuing locomotion in the direction of the newly defined anterior. These observations support the hypothesis that, in spite of their radial body plan, brittle stars employ coordinated, bilaterally symmetrical locomotion."},{"title":"Thermal games in crayfish depend on establishment of social hierarchies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1892","abstract":"An unequal resource distribution is commonly seen in dominance hierarchies, in which the individual with the higher status is more successful in obtaining the resource. One possible resource is preferred temperature. When situations allow, ectotherms regulate their body temperature by behaviourally selecting different environmental conditions, achieving, when possible, a preferred temperature. Using a shuttlebox, the preferred temperature for Procambarus clarkii was determined to be 23.9°C with upper and lower voluntary escape temperatures of 25.9 and 21.8°C, respectively. If this preferred temperature zone (21.8–25.9°C) was valued as a resource, given the choice between a preferred temperature and a non-preferred temperature, crayfish should compete over the preferred temperature, with the dominant individual of dyadic pairs achieving the preferred temperature more often than the subordinate. Using a dual-choice experimental tank, competition over a binary temperature choice between rank-established paired crayfish was determined under both warm and cold challenge conditions (warm vs preferred temperature and cold vs preferred temperature, respectively). In naive pairings, similar levels of competition over the preferred temperature occurred in both warm and cold challenge trials, as predicted by game theory. In established pairings, however, dominant crayfish gained significantly greater access to preferred temperature in both warm and cold challenge conditions. These results demonstrate that crayfish engage in a cost–benefit assessment during their initial agonistic contests over temperature, but as hierarchies mature, these thermal games are decided by the dominant animal gaining primary access to the temperature resource."},{"title":"An experimental exploration of the incorporation of hydrogen isotopes from dietary sources into avian tissues","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1915","abstract":"The analysis of hydrogen stable isotopes (∂D) is a potentially powerful tool for studying animal ecology. Unlike other stable isotopes used in ecological research, however, we are less familiar with the physiological processes that influence the incorporation of hydrogen isotopes from dietary resources to animal tissues. Here we present the results of a controlled feeding experiment utilizing Japanese quail (Cortunix japonica) that was designed to: (1) estimate the relative contributions of diet to the ∂D signatures of blood plasma, red blood cells, intestine, liver, muscle and feathers; (2) investigate possible differences among these same tissues in diet to tissue discrimination; and (3) explore the differences in incorporation dynamics between deuterium (2H) and a well-studied isotope, 13C, for blood plasma solids and red blood cells. Tissues differed in both the relative contribution of diet to tissue ∂D and diet to tissue discrimination. The average residence time of both hydrogen and carbon was significantly lower in plasma solids than in red blood cells. The average residence time of hydrogen was significantly lower than that of carbon in plasma solids, but not in red blood cells. Although the average residence times of hydrogen and carbon were positively correlated, the correlation was weak. Hence the incorporation of carbon seems to be a poor predictor of that of hydrogen."},{"title":"Is reproduction costly? No increase of oxidative damage in breeding bank voles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1799","abstract":"According to life-history theory, investment in reproduction is associated with costs, which should appear as decreased survival to the next reproduction or lower future reproductive success. It has been suggested that oxidative stress may be the proximate mechanism of these trade-offs. Despite numerous studies of the defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) during reproduction, very little is known about the damage caused by ROS to the tissues of wild breeding animals. We measured oxidative damage to lipids and proteins in breeding bank vole (Myodes glareolus) females after rearing one and two litters, and in non-breeding females. We used bank voles from lines selected for high maximum aerobic metabolic rates (which also had high resting metabolic rates and food intake) and non-selected control lines. The oxidative damage was determined in heart, kidneys and skeletal muscles by measuring the concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, as markers of lipid peroxidation, and carbonyl groups in proteins, as markers of protein oxidation. Surprisingly, we found that the oxidative damage to lipids in kidneys and muscles was actually lower in breeding than in non-breeding voles, and it did not differ between animals from the selected and control lines. Thus, contrary to our predictions, females that bred suffered lower levels of oxidative stress than those that did not reproduce. Elevated production of antioxidant enzymes and the protective role of sex hormones may explain the results. The results of the present study do not support the hypothesis that oxidative damage to tissues is the proximate mechanism of reproduction costs."},{"title":"The visual control of landing and obstacle avoidance in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1783","abstract":"Landing behavior is one of the most critical, yet least studied, aspects of insect flight. In order to land safely, an insect must recognize a visual feature, navigate towards it, decelerate, and extend its legs in preparation for touchdown. Although previous studies have focused on the visual stimuli that trigger these different components, the complete sequence has not been systematically studied in a free-flying animal. Using a real-time 3D tracking system in conjunction with high speed digital imaging, we were able to capture the landing sequences of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) from the moment they first steered toward a visual target, to the point of touchdown. This analysis was made possible by a custom-built feedback system that actively maintained the fly in the focus of the high speed camera. The results suggest that landing is composed of three distinct behavioral modules. First, a fly actively turns towards a stationary target via a directed body saccade. Next, it begins to decelerate at a point determined by both the size of the visual target and its rate of expansion on the retina. Finally, the fly extends its legs when the visual target reaches a threshold retinal size of approximately 60 deg. Our data also let us compare landing sequences with flight trajectories that, although initially directed toward a visual target, did not result in landing. In these ‘fly-by’ trajectories, flies steer toward the target but then exhibit a targeted aversive saccade when the target subtends a retinal size of approximately 33 deg. Collectively, the results provide insight into the organization of sensorimotor modules that underlie the landing and search behaviors of insects."},{"title":"Adaptive significance of venom glands in the tadpole madtom Noturus gyrinus (Siluriformes: Ictaluridae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1816","abstract":"Piscine venom glands have implicitly been assumed to be anti-predatory adaptations, but direct examinations of the potential fitness benefits provided by these structures are relatively sparse. In previous experiments examining this question, alternative phenotypes have not been presented to ecologically relevant predators, and the results are thus potentially confounded by the presence of sharp, bony fin spines in these species, which may also represent significant deterrents to predation. Here, I present the results of experiments exposing Micropterus salmoides (largemouth bass) to tadpole madtoms (Noturus gyrinus) with one of several fin spine phenotypes (intact, stripped, absent), which indicate that the venom glands of this species do provide a significant fitness benefit, relative to individuals having fin spines without venom glands or no spines at all. Intact madtoms were repeatedly rejected by the bass and were almost never consumed, while alternative phenotypes were always consumed. Madtoms with stripped fin spines showed increases in predator rejections relative to spineless madtoms and control minnows, but non-significant increases in handling time, contrasting with previous results and predictions regarding the adaptive benefit of these structures. Comparisons with a less venomous catfish species (Ameiurus natalis) indicate that a single protein present in the venom of N. gyrinus may be responsible for providing the significant selective advantage observed in this species. These results, considered in conjunction with other studies of ictalurid biology, suggest that venom evolution in these species is subject to a complex interplay between predator behavior, phylogenetic history, life history strategy and adaptive responses to different predatory regimes."},{"title":"Growth and development of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) in response to chronic food restriction throughout the nestling period","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1806","abstract":"Birds have evolved phenotypic plasticity in growth and developmental patterns in order to respond to fluctuating environmental conditions and to mitigate the impact of poor feeding on fitness. Chronic food shortage can occur during chick development in the wild, and the responses of altricial birds have not been thoroughly studied. House sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings were raised in the laboratory on age-specific meal sizes (controls) or meal sizes 25% less than age-specific amounts (food-restricted) and analyzed at 6, 9 and 12 days post-hatch for differences in growth and development. Food-restricted birds had significantly reduced body mass and body temperature, but skeletal growth was maintained with respect to controls. Muscle mass was significantly reduced and muscle water content was slightly, though not significantly, higher in food-restricted birds, which may reflect slight developmental immaturity. Assimilation organ masses, summed enzymatic capacity of the intestine and lipid content of the liver were significantly reduced in food-restricted birds. Findings from this study indicate that altricial birds experiencing chronic, moderate food restriction throughout the nestling period may allocate resources to structural growth through energy-saving reductions in mass of assimilation organs and body temperature."},{"title":"A vitellogenin polyserine cleavage site: highly disordered conformation protected from proteolysis by phosphorylation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1837","abstract":"Vitellogenin (Vg) is an egg-yolk precursor protein in most oviparous species. In honeybee (Apis mellifera), the protein (AmVg) also affects social behavior and life-span plasticity. Despite its manifold functions, the AmVg molecule remains poorly understood. The subject of our structure-oriented AmVg study is its polyserine tract — a little-investigated repetitive protein segment mostly found in insects. We previously reported that AmVg is tissue specifically cleaved in the vicinity of this tract. Here, we show that, despite its potential for an open, disordered structure, AmVg is unexpectedly resistant to trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion at the tract. Our findings suggest that multiple phosphorylation plays a role in this resilience. Sequence variation is highly pronounced at the polyserine region in insect Vgs. We demonstrate that sequence differences in this region can lead to structural variation, as NMR and circular dichroism (CD) evidence assign different conformational propensities to polyserine peptides from the honeybee and the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis; the former is extended and disordered and the latter more compact and helical. CD analysis of the polyserine region of bumblebee Bombus ignitus and wasp Pimpla nipponica supports a random coil structure in these species. The spectroscopic results strengthen our model of the AmVg polyserine tract as a flexible domain linker shielded by phosphorylation."},{"title":"Changes in extreme cold tolerance, membrane composition and cardiac transcriptome during the first day of thermal acclimation in the porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1824","abstract":"Intertidal zone organisms can experience transient freezing temperatures during winter low tides, but their extreme cold tolerance mechanisms are not known. Petrolisthes cinctipes is a temperate mid–high intertidal zone crab species that can experience wintertime habitat temperatures below the freezing point of seawater. We examined how cold tolerance changed during the initial phase of thermal acclimation to cold and warm temperatures, as well as the persistence of cold tolerance during long-term thermal acclimation. Thermal acclimation for as little as 6 h at 8°C enhanced cold tolerance during a 1 h exposure to –2°C relative to crabs acclimated to 18°C. Potential mechanisms for this enhanced tolerance were elucidated using cDNA microarrays to probe for differences in gene expression in cardiac tissue of warm- and cold-acclimated crabs during the first day of thermal acclimation. No changes in gene expression were detected until 12 h of thermal acclimation. Genes strongly upregulated in warm-acclimated crabs represented immune response and extracellular/intercellular processes, suggesting that warm-acclimated crabs had a generalized stress response and may have been remodelling tissues or altering intercellular processes. Genes strongly upregulated in cold-acclimated crabs included many that are involved in glucose production, suggesting that cold acclimation involves increasing intracellular glucose as a cryoprotectant. Structural cytoskeletal proteins were also strongly represented among the genes upregulated in only cold-acclimated crabs. There were no consistent changes in composition or the level of unsaturation of membrane phospholipid fatty acids with cold acclimation, which suggests that neither short- nor long-term changes in cold tolerance are mediated by changes in membrane fatty acid composition. Overall, our study demonstrates that initial changes in cold tolerance are likely not regulated by transcriptomic responses, but that gene-expression-related changes in homeostasis begin within 12 h, the length of a tidal cycle."},{"title":"How well do muscle biomechanics predict whole-animal locomotor performance? The role of Ca2+ handling","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1847","abstract":"It is important to determine the enabling mechanisms that underlie locomotor performance to explain the evolutionary patterns and ecological success of animals. Our aim was to determine the extent to which calcium (Ca2+) handling dynamics modulate the contractile properties of isolated skeletal muscle, and whether the effects of changing Ca2+ handling dynamics in skeletal muscle are paralleled by changes in whole-animal sprint and sustained swimming performance. Carp (Cyprinus carpio) increased swimming speed by concomitant increases in tail-beat amplitude and frequency. Reducing Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by blocking ryanodine receptors with dantrolene decreased isolated peak muscle force and was paralleled by a decrease in tail-beat frequency and whole-animal sprint performance. An increase in fatigue resistance following dantrolene treatment may reflect the reduced depletion of Ca2+ stores in the SR associated with lower ryanodine receptor (RyR) activity. Blocking RyRs may be detrimental by reducing force production and beneficial by reducing SR Ca2+ depletion so that there was no net effect on critical sustained swimming speed (Ucrit). In isolated muscle, there was no negative effect on force production of blocking Ca2+ release via dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) with nifedipine. Nifedipine decreased fatigue resistance of isolated muscle, which was paralleled by decreases in tail-beat frequency and Ucrit. However, sprint performance also decreased with DHPR inhibition, which may indicate a role in muscle contraction of the Ca2+ released by DHPR into the myocyte. Inhibiting sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) activity with thapsigargin decreased fatigue resistance, suggesting that SERCA activity is important in avoiding Ca2+ store depletion and fatigue. We have shown that different molecular mechanisms modulate the same muscle and whole-animal traits, which provides an explanatory model for the observed variations in locomotor performance within and between species."},{"title":"Challenging zebrafish escape responses by increasing water viscosity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1854","abstract":"Escape responses of fishes have long been studied as a model locomotor behavior in which hypothesized maximal or near-maximal muscle power output is used to generate rapid body bending. In this paper we present the results of experiments that challenged zebrafish (Danio rerio) to perform escape responses in water of altered viscosity, to better understand the effects that the fluid mechanical environment exerts on kinematics. We quantified escape kinematics using 1000 frames s–1 high-speed video, and compared escape response kinematics of fish in three media that differed in viscosity: 1 mPa s (normal water), 10 mPa s and 20 mPa s (20 times normal water viscosity). We hypothesized that because viscosity is increased but not density there will be a different effect on kinematic variables resulting from unsteady (acceleration-dependent) hydrodynamic forces and steady (velocity-dependent) ones. Similarly, we hypothesized that the kinematics of stage 1 will be less affected by viscosity than those of stage 2, as higher angular velocities are reached during stage 1 resulting in higher Reynolds numbers. Our results showed a significant overall effect of viscosity on escape response kinematics but the effect was not in accordance with our predictions. Statistical tests showed that increasing viscosity significantly decreased displacement of the center of mass during stage 1 and after 30 ms, and decreased maximum velocity of the center of mass, maximum angular velocity and acceleration during stage 1, but increased time to maximum angular acceleration and time to maximum linear velocity of the center of mass. Remarkably, increasing water viscosity 20 times did not significantly affect the duration of stage 1 or stage 2."},{"title":"Simulating transoceanic migrations of young loggerhead sea turtles: merging magnetic navigation behavior with an ocean circulation model","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1863","abstract":"Young loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from eastern Florida, USA, undertake a transoceanic migration in which they gradually circle the Sargasso Sea before returning to the North American coast. Loggerheads possess a ‘magnetic map’ in which regional magnetic fields elicit changes in swimming direction along the migratory pathway. In some geographic areas, however, ocean currents move more rapidly than young turtles can swim. Thus, the degree to which turtles can control their migratory movements has remained unclear. In this study, the movements of young turtles were simulated within a high-resolution ocean circulation model using several different behavioral scenarios, including one in which turtles drifted passively and others in which turtles swam briefly in accordance with experimentally derived data on magnetic navigation. Results revealed that small amounts of oriented swimming in response to regional magnetic fields profoundly affected migratory routes and endpoints. Turtles that engaged in directed swimming for as little as 1–3 h per day were 43–187% more likely than passive drifters to reach the Azores, a productive foraging area frequented by Florida loggerheads. They were also more likely to remain within warm-water currents favorable for growth and survival, avoid areas on the perimeter of the migratory route where predation risk and thermal conditions pose threats, and successfully return to the open-sea migratory route if carried into coastal areas. These findings imply that even weakly swimming marine animals may be able to exert strong effects on their migratory trajectories and open-sea distributions through simple navigation responses and minimal swimming."},{"title":"The formation and functional consequences of heterogeneous mitochondrial distributions in skeletal muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1871","abstract":"Diffusion plays a prominent role in governing both rates of aerobic metabolic fluxes and mitochondrial organization in muscle fibers. However, there is no mechanism to explain how the non-homogeneous mitochondrial distributions that are prevalent in skeletal muscle arise. We propose that spatially variable degradation with dependence on O2 concentration, and spatially uniform signals for biogenesis, can account for observed distributions of mitochondria in a diversity of skeletal muscle. We used light and transmission electron microscopy and stereology to examine fiber size, capillarity and mitochondrial distribution in fish red and white muscle, fish white muscle that undergoes extreme hypertrophic growth, and four fiber types in mouse muscle. The observed distributions were compared with those generated using a coupled reaction-diffusion/cellular automata (CA) mathematical model of mitochondrial function. Reaction-diffusion analysis of metabolites such as oxygen, ATP, ADP and PCr involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function were considered. Coupled to the reaction-diffusion approach was a CA approach governing mitochondrial life cycles in response to the metabolic state of the fiber. The model results were consistent with the experimental observations and showed higher mitochondrial densities near the capillaries because of the sometimes steep gradients in oxygen. The present study found that selective removal of mitochondria in the presence of low prevailing local oxygen concentrations is likely the primary factor dictating the spatial heterogeneity of mitochondria in a diversity of fibers. The model results also suggest decreased diffusional constraints corresponding to the heterogeneous mitochondrial distribution assessed using the effectiveness factor, defined as the ratio of the reaction rate in the system with finite rates of diffusion to that in the absence of any diffusion limitation. Thus, the non-uniform distribution benefits the muscle fiber by increasing the energy status and increasing sustainable metabolic rates."},{"title":"Proprioceptive feedback reinforces centrally generated stepping patterns in the cockroach","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1884","abstract":"The relative importance of sensory input for the production of centrally generated motor patterns is crucial to our understanding of how animals coordinate their body segments to locomote. In legged locomotion, where terrain heterogeneity may require stride-by-stride changes in leg placement, evidence suggests that sensory information is essential for the timing of leg movement. In a previous study we showed that in cockroaches, renowned for rapid and stable running, a coordinated pattern can be elicited from the motor centres driving the different legs in the absence of sensory feedback. In the present paper, we assess the role of movement-related sensory inputs in modifying this central pattern. We studied the effect of spontaneous steps as well as imposed transient and periodic movements of a single intact leg, and demonstrate that, depending on the movement properties, the resulting proprioceptive feedback can significantly modify phase relationships among segmental oscillators of other legs. Our analysis suggests that feedback from front legs is weaker but more phasically precise than from hind legs, selectively transferring movement-related information in a manner that strengthens the inherent rhythmic pattern and modulates local perturbations."},{"title":"Molt–breeding overlap alters molt dynamics and behavior in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata castanotis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1957","abstract":"Costly events in the life history cycle of organisms such as reproduction, migration and pelage/plumage replacement are typically separated in time to maximize their outcome. Such temporal separation is thought to be necessitated by energetical trade-offs, and mediated through physiological processes. However, certain species, such as tropical birds, are able to overlap two costly life history stages: reproduction and feather replacement. It has remained unclear how both events progress when they co-occur over extended periods of time. Here we determined the consequences and potential costs of such overlap by comparing molt and behavioral patterns in both sexes of captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis) that were solely molting or were overlapping breeding and molt. Individuals overlapping the early stages of breeding with molt showed a roughly 40% decrease in the growth rate of individual feathers compared with birds that were molting but not breeding. Further, individuals that overlapped breeding and molt tended to molt fewer feathers simultaneously and exhibited longer intervals between shedding consecutive feathers on the tail or the same wing as well as delays in shedding corresponding flight feathers on opposite sides. Overlapping individuals also altered their time budgets: they devoted more than twice the time to feeding while halving the time spent for feather care in comparison to molt-only individuals. These data provide experimental support for the previously untested hypothesis that when molt and reproduction overlap in time, feather replacement will occur at a slower and less intense rate. There were no sex differences in any of the variables assessed, except for a tendency in females to decline body condition more strongly over time during the overlap than males. Our data indicate the existence of major consequences of overlapping breeding and molt, manifested in changes in both molt dynamics and time budgets of both sexes. It is likely that under harsher conditions in natural environments such consequences will be more severe and may result in fitness consequences."},{"title":"Leaf beetle attachment on wrinkles: isotropic friction on anisotropic surfaces","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1975","abstract":"The influence of surface roughness on the attachment ability of insects has been repeatedly reported. In previous experiments, complex surface topographies were used as test substrates, whereas periodical structures have so far been neglected. In the present study, traction experiments with adult beetles Gastrophysa viridula and Leptinotarsa decemlineata were carried out to study the influence of surfaces, structured with periodical wrinkles, on insect attachment. Force measurements were carried out on male and female insects, both intact and after removal of claws, performing tethered walking on five polydimethylsiloxane substrates: (i) smooth, non-structured (control), (ii–v) structured with wrinkles of different wavelengths (366, 502, 911 and 25,076 nm). In two test series, beetles walked either perpendicular or parallel to the wrinkle alignment. Adults of G. viridula produced generally higher forces than those of L. decemlineata. The results show that the alignment of wrinkles had no significant influence on the force generation by beetles, probably because of the skewed position of their tarsomeres relative to the substrates. In both sexes, the highest force values were obtained on surfaces with wrinkles of 25 μm wavelength. On other wrinkled substrates, forces were significantly reduced in both males and females compared with the smooth, flat control, with the minimum force achieved on wrinkles with a wavelength of 911 nm."},{"title":"Diet influences salinity preference of an estuarine fish, the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1965","abstract":"Understanding the interplay among the external environment, physiology and adaptive behaviour is crucial for understanding how animals survive in their natural environments. The external environment can have wide ranging effects on the physiology of animals, while behaviour determines which environments are encountered. Here, we identified changes in the behavioural selection of external salinity in Fundulus heteroclitus, an estuarine teleost, as a consequence of digesting a meal. Fish that consumed high levels of dietary calcium exhibited a higher preferred salinity compared with unfed fish, an effect that was exaggerated by elevated dietary sodium chloride. The mean swimming speed (calculated as a proxy of activity level) was not affected by consuming a diet of any type. Constraining fish to water of 22 p.p.t. salinity during the digestion of a meal did not alter the amount of calcium that was absorbed across the intestine. However, when denied the capacity to increase their surrounding salinity, the compromised ability to excrete calcium to the water resulted in significantly elevated plasma calcium levels, a potentially hazardous physiological consequence. This study is the first to show that fish behaviourally exploit their surroundings to enhance their ionoregulation during digestion, and to pinpoint the novel role of dietary calcium and sodium in shaping this behaviour. We conclude that in order to resolve physiological disturbances in ion balance created by digestion, fish actively sense and select the environment they inhabit. Ultimately, this may result in transient diet-dependent alteration of the ecological niches occupied by fishes, with broad implications for both physiology and ecology."},{"title":"Comparison of structural, architectural and mechanical aspects of cellular and acellular bone in two teleost fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/11/1983","abstract":"The histological diversity of the skeletal tissues of fishes is impressive compared with that of other vertebrate groups, yet our understanding of the functional consequences of this diversity is limited. In particular, although it has been known since the mid-1800s that a large number of fish species possess acellular bones, the mechanical advantages and consequences of this structural characteristic – and therefore the nature of the evolution of this feature – remain unclear. Although several studies have examined the material properties of fish bone, these have used a variety of techniques and there have been no direct contrasts of acellular and cellular bone. We report on a comparison of the structural and mechanical properties of the ribs and opercula between two freshwater fish – the common carp Cyprinus carpio (a fish with cellular bone) and the tilapia Oreochromis aureus (a fish with acellular bone). We used light microscopy to show that the bones in both fish species exhibit poor blood supply and possess discrete tissue zones, with visible layering suggesting differences in the underlying collagen architecture. We performed identical micromechanical testing protocols on samples of the two bone types to determine the mechanical properties of the bone material of opercula and ribs. Our data support the consensus of literature values, indicating that Young’s moduli of cellular and acellular bones are in the same range, and lower than Young’s moduli of the bones of mammals and birds. Despite these similarities in mechanical properties between the bone tissues of the fish species tested here, cellular bone had significantly lower mineral content than acellular bone; furthermore, the percentage ash content and bone mineral density values (derived from micro-CT scans) show that the bone of these fishes is less mineralized than amniote bone. Although we cannot generalize from our data to the numerous remaining teleost species, the results presented here suggest that while cellular and acellular fish bone may perform similarly from a mechanical standpoint, there are previously unappreciated differences in the structure and composition of these bone types."},{"title":"Localized fluidization burrowing mechanics of Ensis directus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/12/2072","abstract":"Muscle measurements of Ensis directus, the Atlantic razor clam, indicate that the organism only has sufficient strength to burrow a few centimeters into the soil, yet razor clams burrow to over 70 cm. In this paper, we show that the animal uses the motions of its valves to locally fluidize the surrounding soil and reduce burrowing drag. Substrate deformations were measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a novel visualization system that enabled us to see through the soil and watch E. directus burrow in situ. PIV data, supported by soil and fluid mechanics theory, show that contraction of the valves of E. directus locally fluidizes the surrounding soil. Particle and fluid mixtures can be modeled as a Newtonian fluid with an effective viscosity based on the local void fraction. Using these models, we demonstrate that E. directus is strong enough to reach full burrow depth in fluidized soil, but not in static soil. Furthermore, we show that the method of localized fluidization reduces the amount of energy required to reach burrow depth by an order of magnitude compared with penetrating static soil, and leads to a burrowing energy that scales linearly with depth rather than with depth squared."},{"title":"Waggle dance effect: dancing in autumn reduces the mass loss of a honeybee colony","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1633","abstract":"A honeybee informs her nestmates about the location of a profitable food source that she has visited by means of a waggle dance: a round dance and a figure-of-eight dance for a short- and long-distance food source, respectively. Consequently, the colony achieves an effective collection of food. However, it is still not fully understood how much effect the dance behavior has on the food collection, because most of the relevant experiments have been performed only in limited locations under limited experimental conditions. Here, we examined the efficacy of the waggle dances by physically preventing bees from dancing and then analyzing the changes in daily mass of the hive as an index of daily food collection. To eliminate place- and year-specific effects, the experiments were performed under fully natural conditions in three different cities in Japan from mid September to early October in three different years. Because the experiments were performed in autumn, all six of the tested colonies lost mass on most of the experimental days. When the dance was prevented, the daily reduction in mass change was greater than when the dance was allowed, i.e. the dance inhibited the reduction of the hive mass. This indicates that dance is effective for food collection. Furthermore, clear inhibition was observed on the first two days of the experiments; after that, inhibition was no longer evident. This result suggests that the bee colony adapted to the new environment."},{"title":"The determination of nest depth in founding queens of leaf-cutting ants (Atta vollenweideri): idiothetic and temporal control","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1642","abstract":"Leaf-cutting ant queens excavate a founding nest consisting of a vertical tunnel and a final horizontal chamber. Nest foundation is very time consuming, and colony success depends on the excavated depth. Although shallow nests may be energetically cheaper to dig, queens may be more exposed to the changing environment. Deeper chambers, in contrast, may be climatically more stable, but are more expensive to dig. We investigated the mechanisms underlying the control of nest depth in queens of the leaf-cutting ant Atta vollenweideri. We focused on the use of internal information for the control of nest depth, and therefore maintained the soil and environmental conditions invariant during the different laboratory experiments. We compared the tunnel lengths excavated by queens that were able to complete their nests earlier, faster or slower than under standard conditions. An earlier and faster nest completion was obtained by offering queens either pre-excavated tunnels of different lengths, soils at different temperatures, or soft sandy soils. A slower nest excavation was induced by offering queens harder dry soils, and by delaying the start of digging several days after the nuptial flight. Results indicate that the determination of nest depth was a regulated process involving the use of internal references: queens excavated their tunnels either until a particular depth was reached or for some predetermined length of time. Queens appear to monitor their movements while walking up und down the tunnel, and to compare this sensory information with a motor command that represents a preset tunnel length to be excavated before switching to chamber digging. In addition to this form of idiothetic control, results indicate that the elapsed digging time also feeds back onto the control system. It is argued that the determination of nest depth, i.e. the transition from tunnel to chamber digging, is initiated either after a preset tunnel length is reached, or as soon as a maximal time interval has elapsed, irrespective of the excavated tunnel length. A control system using both idiothetic and temporal information, as demonstrated in the present study, allows queens to flexibly react to different soil conditions, and therefore avoid excessive time and energy investments. Possible mechanisms underlying the control of chamber size are also discussed."},{"title":"Within-lifetime trade-offs but evolutionary freedom for hormonal and immunological traits: evidence from mice bred for high voluntary exercise","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1651","abstract":"Chronic increases in circulating corticosterone (CORT) generally suppress immune function, but it is not known whether evolved increases necessarily have similar adverse effects. Moreover, the evolution of immune function might be constrained by the sharing of signaling molecules, such as CORT, across numerous physiological systems. Laboratory house mice (Mus domesticus Linnaeus) from four replicate lines selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running (HR lines) generally had baseline circulating CORT approximately twofold higher than in four non-selected control (C) lines. To test whether elevated baseline CORT suppresses the inflammatory response in HR mice, we injected females with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). All mice injected with LPS exhibited classic signs of an inflammatory response, including sickness behavior, loss of body mass, reduced locomotor activity (i.e. voluntary wheel running), enlarged spleens and livers, elevated hematocrit and elevated inflammatory cytokines. However, as compared with C mice, the inflammatory response was not suppressed in HR mice. Our results, and those of a previous study, suggest that selective breeding for high voluntary exercise has not altered immune function. They also suggest that the effects of evolved differences in baseline CORT levels may differ greatly from effects of environmental factors (often viewed as ‘stressors’) that alter baseline CORT during an individual’s lifetime. In particular, evolved increases in circulating levels of ‘stress hormones’ are not necessarily associated with detrimental suppression of the inflammatory response, presumably as a result of correlated evolution of other physiological systems (counter-measures). Our results have important implications for the interpretation of elevated stress hormones and of immune indicators in natural populations."},{"title":"Small organ size contributes to the slow pace of life in tropical birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1662","abstract":"Attributes of an animal’s life history, such as reproductive rate or longevity, typically fall along a ‘slow–fast’ continuum. Animals at the fast end of this continuum, such as temperate birds, are thought to experience high rates of mortality and invest more resources in reproduction, whereas animals at the slow end, such as tropical birds, live longer, have fewer offspring and invest more resources in self-maintenance. We have previously shown that tropical birds, compared with temperate species, have a reduced basal (BMR) and peak metabolic rate (PMR), patterns consistent with a slow pace of life. Here, we elucidate a fundamental linkage between the smaller mass of central organs of tropical species and their reduced BMR, and between their smaller flight muscles and reduced PMR. Analyses of up to 408 species from the literature showed that the heart, flight muscles, liver, pancreas and kidneys were smaller in tropical species. Direct measurements on 49 species showed smaller heart, lungs, flight muscles, liver, kidneys, ovaries and testes in tropical species, as well as lower feather mass. In combination, our results indicate that the benign tropical environment imposes a relaxed selection pressure on high levels of sustained metabolic performance, permitting species to reduce the mass of organs that are energetically costly to maintain. Brain, gizzard and intestine were exceptions, even though energy turnover of brain and intestine are high. Feather mass was 37% lower in tropical species compared with similar-sized temperate birds, supporting the idea that temperate birds require more insulation for thermoregulation."},{"title":"Plant odour stimuli reshape pheromonal representation in neurons of the antennal lobe macroglomerular complex of a male moth","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1670","abstract":"Male moths are confronted with complex odour mixtures in a natural environment when flying towards a female-emitted sex pheromone source. Whereas synergistic effects of sex pheromones and plant odours have been observed at the behavioural level, most investigations at the peripheral level have shown an inhibition of pheromone responses by plant volatiles, suggesting a potential role of the central nervous system in reshaping the peripheral information. We thus investigated the interactions between sex pheromone and a behaviourally active plant volatile, heptanal, and their effects on responses of neurons in the pheromone-processing centre of the antennal lobe, the macroglomerular complex, in the moth Agrotis ipsilon. Our results show that most of these pheromone-sensitive neurons responded to the plant odour. Most neurons responded to the pheromone with a multiphasic pattern and were anatomically identified as projection neurons. They responded either with excitation or pure inhibition to heptanal, and the response to the mixture pheromone + heptanal was generally weaker than to the pheromone alone, showing a suppressive effect of heptanal. However, these neurons responded with a better resolution to pulsed stimuli. The other neurons with either purely excitatory or inhibitory responses to all three stimuli did not exhibit significant differences in responses between stimuli. Although the suppression of the pheromone responses in AL neurons by the plant odour is counter-intuitive at first glance, the observed better resolution of pulsed stimuli is probably more important than high sensitivity to the localization of a calling female."},{"title":"Auditory processing at two time scales by the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1681","abstract":"The acoustic display of many cricket species consists of series of pulses grouped into chirps, and thus information is distributed over both short and long time scales. Here we investigated the temporal cues that females of the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus used to detect a chirp pattern on a longer time scale than the fast pulse pattern. First, over a range of chirp and pause durations (100–400 ms), the duty cycle of the chirp pattern emerged as the most important cue for detection. The songs of males showed a distribution at lower duty cycles than preferred by females. The duty cycle also limited the responses of females at very short durations and pauses (below 80 ms). Second, by systematic variation of pulse and chirp periods of stimuli, an intermediate response field emerged that revealed the best responses of female crickets to patterns with amplitude modulations on both short and long time scales. On average, females also responded weakly to stimuli that contained amplitude modulations of only one time scale. Third, test patterns were constructed by addition of modulation frequencies rather than rectangular pulses. These tests showed that female crickets processed the chirp pattern in the time domain and tolerated noise levels up to a modulation depth of 50%. The combined evidence from all three approaches indicated inhibitory effects of unattractive patterns on both time scales. The fusion of short and long time scales during auditory processing by female crickets corresponded to a weighted AND-like operation of two processing modules, the pulse and the chirp filter."},{"title":"Control of luminescence from pygmy shark (Squaliolus aliae) photophores","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1691","abstract":"The smalleye pygmy shark (Squaliolus aliae) is a dwarf pelagic shark from the Dalatiidae family that harbours thousands of tiny photophores. In this work, we studied the organisation and physiological control of these photogenic organs. Results show that they are mainly situated on the ventral side of the shark, forming a homogeneous ventral photogenic area that appears well suited for counterillumination, a well-known camouflage technique of pelagic organisms. Isolated ventral skin patches containing photophores did not respond to classical neurotransmitters and nitric oxide but produced light after melatonin (MT) application. Prolactin and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone inhibited this hormonally induced luminescence as well as the spontaneous luminescence from the photogenic tissue. The action of MT seems to be mediated by binding to the MT2 receptor subtype, as the MT2 receptor agonist 4P-PDOT inhibited the luminescence induced by this hormone. Binding to this receptor probably decreases the intracellular cAMP concentration because forskolin inhibited spontaneous and MT-induced luminescence. In addition, a GABA inhibitory tonus seems to be present in the photogenic tissue as well, as GABA inhibited MT-induced luminescence and the application of bicuculline provoked luminescence from S. aliae photophores. Similarly to what has been found in Etmopteridae, the other luminous shark family, the main target of the luminescence control appears to be the melanophores covering the photocytes. Results suggest that bioluminescence first appeared in Dalatiidae when they adopted a pelagic style at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary, and was modified by Etmopteridae when they started to colonize deep-water niches and rely on this light for intraspecific behaviours."},{"title":"Oesophageal chemoreceptors of blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, sense chemical deterrents and can block ingestion of food","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1700","abstract":"Decapod crustaceans such as blue crabs possess a variety of chemoreceptors that control different stages of the feeding process. All these chemoreceptors are putative targets for feeding deterrents that cause animals to avoid or reject otherwise palatable food. As a first step towards characterizing the chemoreceptors that mediate the effect of deterrents, we used a behavioral approach to investigate their precise location. Data presented here demonstrate that chemoreceptors located on the antennules, pereiopods and mouthparts do not mediate the food-rejection effects of a variety of deterrents, both natural and artificial to crabs. Crabs always searched for deterrent-laced food and took it to their oral region. The deterrent effect was manifested as either rejection or extensive manipulation, but in both cases crabs bit the food. The biting behavior is relevant because the introduction of food into the oral cavity ensured that the deterrents gained access to the oesophageal taste receptors, and so we conclude that they are the ones mediating rejection. Additional support comes from the fact that a variety of deterrent compounds evoked oesophageal dilatation, which is mediated by oesophageal receptors and has been linked to food rejection. Further, there is a positive correlation between a compound’s ability to elicit rejection and its ability to evoke oesophageal dilatation. The fact that deterrents do not act at a distance is in accordance with the limited solubility of most known feeding deterrents, and likely influences predator–prey interactions and their outcome: prey organisms will be attacked and bitten before deterrents become relevant."},{"title":"A long-latency aversive learning mechanism enables locusts to avoid odours associated with the consequences of ingesting toxic food","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1711","abstract":"Avoiding food that contains toxins is crucial for the survival of many animals, particularly herbivores, because many plants defend themselves with toxins. Some animals can learn to avoid food containing toxins not through its taste but by the toxins’ effects following ingestion, though how they do so remains unclear. We studied how desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria), which are generalist herbivores, form post-ingestive aversive memories and use them to make appropriate olfactory-based decisions in a Y-maze. Locusts form an aversion gradually to an odour paired with food containing the toxin nicotine hydrogen tartrate (NHT), suggesting the involvement of a long-latency associative mechanism. Pairing of odour and toxin-free food accompanied by NHT injections at different latencies showed that locusts could form an association between an odour and toxic malaise, which could be separated by up to 30 min. Tasting but not swallowing the food, or the temporal separation of odour and food, prevents the formation of these long-latency associations, showing that they are post-ingestive. A second associative mechanism not contingent upon feeding operates only when odour presentation is simultaneous with NHT injection. Post-ingestive memory formation is not disrupted by exposure to a novel odour alone but can be if the odour is accompanied by simultaneous NHT injection. Thus, the timing with which food, odour and toxin are encountered whilst foraging is likely to influence memory formation and subsequent foraging decisions. Therefore, locusts can form specific long-lasting aversive olfactory associations that they can use to avoid toxin-containing foods whilst foraging."},{"title":"Regulation of the mTOR signaling network in hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1720","abstract":"For many small mammals, survival over the winter months is a serious challenge because of low environmental temperatures and limited food availability. The solution for many species, such as thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), is hibernation, an altered physiological state characterized by seasonal heterothermy and entry into long periods of torpor that are interspersed with short arousals back to euthermia. During torpor, metabolic rate is strongly reduced to achieve major energy savings, and a coordinated depression of non-essential ATP-expensive functions such as protein synthesis takes place. This study examines the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, a crucial component of the insulin receptor network, over six stages of the torpor–arousal cycle of hibernation. Immunoblots showed that the phosphorylation state of mTORSer2448 was strongly reduced in skeletal muscle (by 55%) during late torpor but increased by 200% during early arousal compared with euthermia. However, the phosphorylation state of this residue remained relatively constant in cardiac muscle during torpor but was enhanced during entrance into torpor and early arousal from torpor stages (by 2.9- and 3.2-fold, respectively). Phosphorylation states of upstream regulators of mTOR, p-AktThr473 and p-TSC2Thr1462, were also suppressed in skeletal muscle by 55 and 51%, respectively, during late torpor, as were selected downstream substrates – p-4E-BP1Thr46 and p-S6Ser235 contents dropped by 74 and 41%, respectively. Overall, the results indicate suppressed mTOR signaling in skeletal muscle, but not cardiac muscle, during torpor. By contrast, activation of mTOR and other components of the mTORC1 complex (p-PRAS40Thr246 and GβL) occurred during early arousal in both skeletal and cardiac muscle."},{"title":"The gaits of primates: center of mass mechanics in walking, cantering and galloping ring-tailed lemurs, Lemur catta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1728","abstract":"Most primates, including lemurs, have a broad range of locomotor capabilities, yet much of the time, they walk at slow speeds and amble, canter or gallop at intermediate and fast speeds. Although numerous studies have investigated limb function during primate quadrupedalism, how the center of mass (COM) moves is not well understood. Here, we examined COM energy, work and power during walking, cantering and galloping in ring-tailed lemurs, Lemur catta (N=5), over a broad speed range (0.43–2.91 m s–1). COM energy recoveries were substantial during walking (35–71%) but lower during canters and gallops (10–51%). COM work, power and collisional losses increased with speed. The positive COM works were 0.625 J kg–1 m–1 for walks and 1.661 J kg–1 m–1 for canters and gallops, which are in the middle range of published values for terrestrial animals. Although some discontinuities in COM mechanics were evident between walking and cantering, there was no apparent analog to the trot–gallop transition across the intermediate and fast speed range (dimensionless v>0.75, Fr>0.5). A phenomenological model of a lemur cantering and trotting at the same speed shows that canters ensure continuous contact of the body with the substrate while reducing peak vertical COM forces, COM stiffness and COM collisions. We suggest that cantering, rather than trotting, at intermediate speeds may be tied to the arboreal origins of the Order Primates. These data allow us to better understand the mechanics of primate gaits and shed new light on primate locomotor evolution."},{"title":"Odorant tuning of olfactory crypt cells from juvenile and adult rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1740","abstract":"Teleost fish lack independent olfactory organs for odorant and pheromone detection. Instead, they have a single sensory epithelium with two populations of receptor neurons, ciliated and microvillous, that are conserved among vertebrates, and a unique receptor cell type named the olfactory crypt cell. Crypt cells were shown to be chemosensory neurons that project to specific areas in the olfactory bulb, but their odorant tuning and overall function remain unclear. Reproduction in fish is generally synchronized by sex pheromonal signaling between males and females, but the sensors responsible for pheromone detection remain unknown. In crucian carp, a seasonal variation in the population of olfactory crypt cells and their brain projections pathways, involved in reproduction, led to the hypothesis of a role as sex pheromone detectors. In the present study, morphology and localization of olfactory crypt cells were compared between juvenile and mature rainbow trout of both sexes, and calcium imaging was used to visualize responses of crypt cells from the three groups to common social and food-related odorants, sex hormones and conspecific tissue extracts. Crypt cells from mature trout were found to be larger than those of juvenile specimens, and preferentially localized to the apical surface of the olfactory epithelium. Although a fraction of crypt cells of all groups responded to common odorants such as amino acids and bile salts, cells from mature trout showed a characteristic preference for gonadal extracts and hormones from the opposite sex. These results support an involvement of olfactory crypt cells in reproduction-related olfactory signaling in fishes."},{"title":"Tarantulas do not shoot silk from their legs: experimental evidence in four species of New World tarantulas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1749","abstract":"Theraphosid tarantulas, like all other spiders, secrete silk from spigots on the abdominal spinnerets. A few years ago, it was proposed that the large tarantula Aphonopelma seemanni could extrude silk from specialized spigots on the tarsi to help adhesion to vertical surfaces. This suggestion was later questioned because silk was not observed after the spinnerets had been sealed. Recently, experiments with the tarantula Grammostola rosea again suggested tarsal silk secretion. All observations of the supposed tarsal silk were made in spiders with functional spinnerets, thus contamination with silk coming from the spinnerets could not be excluded. Recent morphological arguments also questioned putative tarsal spigots and proposed that they are actually contact chemoreceptors. We here test the supposed tarsal silk secretion in Aphonopelma seemanni, Avicularia avicularia, Brachypelma vagans and Grammostola mollicoma using similar experimental conditions as the previous authors, but with sealed spinnerets. Our results clearly demonstrate that when spinnerets are sealed, tarantulas do not show any tarsal silk secretion. We reinterpret those putative tarsal spigots and discuss possible evolutionary implications of these findings."},{"title":"Neuromuscular control of free-flight yaw turns in the hawkmoth Manduca sexta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1766","abstract":"The biomechanical properties of an animal’s locomotor structures profoundly influence the relationship between neuromuscular inputs and body movements. In particular, passive stability properties are of interest as they may offer a non-neural mechanism for simplifying control of locomotion. Here, we hypothesized that a passive stability property of animal flight, flapping counter-torque (FCT), allows hawkmoths to control planar yaw turns in a damping-dominated framework that makes rotational velocity directly proportional to neuromuscular activity. This contrasts with a more familiar inertia-dominated framework where acceleration is proportional to force and neuromuscular activity. To test our hypothesis, we collected flight muscle activation timing, yaw velocity and acceleration data from freely flying hawkmoths engaged in planar yaw turns. Statistical models built from these data then allowed us to infer the degree to which the moths inhabit either damping- or inertia-dominated control domains. Contrary to our hypothesis, a combined model corresponding to inertia-dominated control of yaw but including substantial damping effects best linked the neuromuscular and kinematic data. This result shows the importance of including passive stability properties in neuromechanical models of flight control and reveals possible trade-offs between manoeuvrability and stability derived from damping."},{"title":"Developmental phenotypic plasticity in a marsupial","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1552","abstract":"Climate change is likely to substantially affect the distribution ranges of species. However, little is known about how different mammalian taxa respond morphologically and physiologically to a rapid change of climate.

Fat-tailed dunnarts (Sminthopsis crassicaudata, Dasyuridae) were reared at an ambient temperature (Ta) of 16°C [cold-reared (CR)] or 22°C [warm-reared (WR)] until they reached adult age (>200 days). Body and head length of CR animals were significantly longer than in WR animals (mean ± s.e.m.; body: CR 80.8±6 mm, WR 76.4±5 mm; head: CR 29.4±3 mm, WR 27.5±2 mm), but other body attributes were not significantly different. Use of torpor was more frequent, torpor bout duration was longer and average daily metabolic rate and percentage of savings when using torpor were significantly higher (P<0.01) in CR than in WR animals at 16°C Ta but not at 24°C. Furthermore, resting metabolic rates measured at 16°C Ta were significantly lower in CR than WR animals; at 30°C Ta values were similar. Our results do not conform to Allen’s rule, but to some extent they do conform to Bergmann’s rule. However, the data demonstrate that a relatively moderate cold exposure from birth until adulthood induces marked changes in the morphology and thermal energetics of small marsupials. Such short-term phenotypic responses without the need for long-term selection are likely important for the ability to cope with different climates over a wide range of distribution, but will also play a crucial role in enhancing the survival of species during climate change."},{"title":"Constraints-based stoichiometric analysis of hypoxic stress on steroidogenesis in fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1753","abstract":"In this study, an in silico genome-scale metabolic model of steroidogenesis was used to investigate the effects of hypoxic stress on steroid hormone productions in fish. Adult female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed to hypoxia for 7 days with fish sub-sampled on days 1, 3 and 7 of exposure. At each time point, selected steroid enzyme gene expressions and steroid hormone productions were quantified in ovaries. Fold changes in steroid enzyme gene expressions were used to qualitatively scale transcript enzyme reaction constraints (akin to the range of an enzyme’s catalytic activity) in the in silico model. Subsequently, in silico predicted steroid hormone productions were qualitatively compared with experimental results. Key findings were as follows. (1) In silico gene deletion analysis identified highly conserved ‘essential’ genes required for steroid hormone productions. These agreed well (75%) with literature-published genes downregulated in vertebrates (fish and mammal) exposed to hypoxia. (2) Quantification of steroid hormones produced ex vivo from ovaries showed a significant reduction for 17β-estradiol and 17α,20β-dihydroxypregnenone production after 24 h (day 1) of exposure. This lowered 17β-estradiol production was concomitant with downregulation of cyp19a1a gene expression in ovaries. In silico predictions showed agreement with experimentation by predicting effects on estrogen (17β-estradiol and estrone) production. (3) Stochastic sampling of in silico reactions indicated that cholesterol uptake and catalysis to pregnenolone along with estrogen methyltransferase and glucuronidation reactions were also impacted by hypoxia. Taken together, this in silico analysis introduces a powerful model for pathway analysis that can lend insights on the effects of various stressor scenarios on metabolic functions."},{"title":"Identified antennular near-field receptors trigger reflex flicking in the crayfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1559","abstract":"Near-field disturbances in the water column are known to trigger reflex antennular flicking in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii. We have identified the hydrodynamic sensors on the lateral antennular flagellum that constitute an afferent limb of this reflex and have measured the relative directionally dependent thresholds of the sensory neurons associated with these structures to hydrodynamic stimulation. Twenty-five individual standing feathered sensilla, comprising a sparse, linearly arrayed population of near-field sensors along the lateral and medial antennular flagella, were exposed to standardized pulsatile stimuli at 20 deg intervals along a 320 deg circular track. The results indicate that the sensilla are most sensitive to such stimulation in the plane of the flagellar axis. Identification and mechanical stimulation of single feathered sensilla in some preparations consistently evoked a flick reflex at maximal response latency, indicating that these sensors constitute at least one afferent limb for the reflex behavior. Experiments in which response latencies were measured following mechanical stimulation of truncated flagella, and were compared with the latencies in respective intact flagella, suggest that summation of inputs from the feathered sensillar pathways generates reflex flicking at minimal latencies. We discuss the possible central mechanisms that may underlie detection of critically important signals from this population of highly sensitive, inherently noisy sensors."},{"title":"Vigorous SO42– influx via the gills is balanced by enhanced SO42– excretion by the kidney in eels after seawater adaptation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/10/1775","abstract":"Sulfate (SO42–) is maintained at ∼1 mmol–1 l–1 in teleost fishes that are exposed to media of varying SO42– concentrations.

Unlike Mozambique tilapia and chum salmon, Japanese eels maintained higher plasma SO42– concentration in freshwater (6.2±2.3 mmol l–1) than in seawater (0.7±0.1 mmol l–1). We then analyzed the whole-body SO42– budget using 35SO42–. 35SO42– influx in seawater-adapted eels occurred by 84.5% via body surfaces and 15.5% via digestive tracts. The SO42– influx was higher in seawater eels (1.55 μmol kg–1 h–1) than in freshwater eels (0.09 μmol kg–1 min–1), but it was facilitated in freshwater eels when the difference in SO42– concentrations between plasma and environment was taken into account (freshwater eels, 6.2 vs 0.3 mmol l–1; seawater eels, 0.7 vs 30 mmol l–1). One hour after injection of 35SO42– into the blood of seawater eels, the kidney excreted ∼97% of the ionized form, whereas the radioactivity increased gradually in the medium and the rectal fluid more than 3 h after injection. As the radioactivity was poorly adsorbed by anion-exchange resin, 35SO42– in the blood may be incorporated into cells and excreted by the intestine, gills and skin, probably as mucus. These results show that freshwater eels take up SO42– actively from the environment, but seawater eels cope with the obligatory influx of SO42– through the gills by excreting excess SO42– via the kidney and in mucus."},{"title":"Active sensing via movement shapes spatiotemporal patterns of sensory feedback","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1567","abstract":"Previous work has shown that animals alter their locomotor behavior to increase sensing volumes.

Here we show that weakly electric fish dramatically adjust their locomotor behavior in relation to changes of modality-specific information in a task in which increasing sensory volume is irrelevant. We varied sensory information during a refuge-tracking task by changing illumination (vision) and conductivity (electroreception). The gain between refuge movement stimuli and fish tracking responses was functionally identical across all sensory conditions. However, there was a significant increase in the tracking error in the dark (no visual cues). This was a result of spontaneous whole-body oscillations (0.1 to 1 Hz) produced by the fish. These movements were costly: in the dark, fish swam over three times further when tracking and produced more net positive mechanical work. The magnitudes of these oscillations increased as electrosensory salience was degraded via increases in conductivity. In addition, tail bending (1.5 to 2.35 Hz), which has been reported to enhance electrosensory perception, occurred only during trials in the dark. These data show that both categories of movements – whole-body oscillations and tail bends – actively shape the spatiotemporal dynamics of electrosensory feedback."},{"title":"Divalent metal (Ca, Cd, Mn, Zn) uptake and interactions in the aquatic insect Hydropsyche sparna","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1575","abstract":"Despite their ecological importance and prevalent use as ecological indicators, the trace element physiology of aquatic insects remains poorly studied. Understanding divalent metal transport processes at the water–insect interface is important because these metals may be essential (e.g. Ca), essential and potentially toxic (e.g. Zn) or non-essential and toxic (e.g. Cd). We measured accumulation kinetics of Zn and Cd across dissolved concentrations ranging 4 orders of magnitude and examined interactions with Ca and Mn in the caddisfly Hydropsyche sparna. Here, we provide evidence for at least two transport systems for both Zn and Cd, the first of which operates at concentrations below 0.8 μmol l–1 (and is fully saturable for Zn). We observed no signs of saturation of a second lower affinity transport system at concentrations up to 8.9 μmol l–1 Cd and 15.3 μmol l–1 Zn. In competition studies at 0.6 μmol l–1 Zn and Cd, the presence of Cd slowed Zn accumulation by 35% while Cd was unaffected by Zn. At extreme concentrations (listed above), Cd accumulation was unaffected by the presence of Zn whereas Zn accumulation rates were reduced by 58%. Increasing Ca from 31.1 μmol l–1 to 1.35 mmol l–1 resulted in only modest decreases in Cd and Zn uptake. Mn decreased adsorption of Cd and Zn to the integument but not internalization. The L-type Ca2+ channel blockers verapamil and nifedipine and the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor carboxyeosin had no influence on Ca, Cd or Zn accumulation rates, while Ruthenium Red, a Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, significantly decreased the accumulation of all three in a concentration-dependent manner."},{"title":"Effects of host diet and thermal state on feeding performance of the flea Xenopsylla ramesis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1435","abstract":"We examined feeding performance of the flea Xenopsylla ramesis on three different hosts: its natural, granivorous, rodent host, Sundevall’s jird (Meriones crassus); the frugivorous Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus); and an insectivorous bat, Kuhl’s pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii). Because these fleas are not known to occur on bats, we hypothesized that the fleas’ feeding performance (i.e. feeding and digestion rates) would be higher when feeding on their natural host than on either of the bats that they do not naturally parasitize. We found that mass-specific blood-meal size of both male and female fleas was significantly lower when feeding on Kuhl’s pipistrelles than on the other two species, but was not different in female fleas feeding on fruit bats or on jirds at all stages of digestion. However, more male fleas achieved higher levels of engorgement if they fed on Sundevall’s jirds than if they fed on Egyptian fruit bats. The fleas digested blood of fruit bats and jirds significantly faster than blood of Kuhl’s pipistrelle. In addition, after a single blood meal, the survival time of fleas fed on normothermic Kuhl’s pipistrelles was significantly shorter than that of fleas fed on Sundevall’s jirds and even lower when male fleas fed on Egyptian fruit bats. Thus, our prediction was partially supported: normothermic Kuhl’s pipistrelles were inferior hosts for fleas compared with Sandevall’s jirds and Egyptian fruit bats. Interestingly, the proportion of engorged fleas that fed on torpid Kuhl’s pipistrelles was significantly higher than the proportion of the fleas that fed on normothermic individuals, indicating that becoming torpid might be a liability, rather than an effective defense against parasites."},{"title":"In ovo temperature manipulation differentially influences limb musculoskeletal development in two lines of chick embryos selected for divergent growth rates","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1594","abstract":"Selective breeding has led to diverging phenotypic evolution in layer and broiler chickens through genomic and epigenetic modifications. Here we show that in ovo environmental manipulation differentially influences embryonic limb muscle phenotype in these two breeds. We demonstrate that raising incubation temperature from 37.5 to 38.5°C between embryonic days (ED) 4 and 7 increased motility and body mass in both layer and broiler embryos. In layers, this was accompanied by gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy, increased fibre and nuclei numbers and a higher nuclei to fibre ratio (ED18), preceded by increased hindlimb Myf5 (ED5–8), Pax7 (ED5–10), BMP4 (ED6–9) and IGF-I (ED9–10, ED18) mRNAs. In broilers, the same temperature treatment led to reduced gastrocnemius cross-sectional area with fewer fibres and nuclei and an unchanged fibre to nuclei ratio (ED18). This was preceded by a delay in the peak of hindlimb Myf5 expression, increased Pax7 (ED5, ED7–10) and BMP4 (ED6–8) but reduced IGF-I (ED8–10) mRNAs. Rather than promoting myogenesis as in layer embryos, the temperature treatment promoted gastrocnemius intramuscular fat deposition in broilers (ED18) preceded by increased hindlimb PPARγ mRNA (ED7–10). The treatment increased tibia/tarsus bone length as well as femur cross-sectional area in both breeds, but femur length and bone to cartilage ratio in the femur and tibia/tarsus were only increased in treated layers (ED18). We conclude that in ovo temperature manipulation differentially affected the molecular regulation of hindlimb myogenic, adipogenic and growth factor expression in broiler and layer embryos, leading to differential changes in muscle phenotype. The underlying interactive mechanisms between genes and the environment need further investigation."},{"title":"Audiogram and auditory critical ratios of two Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1442","abstract":"Manatees inhabit turbid, shallow-water environments and have been shown to have poor visual acuity. Previous studies on hearing have demonstrated that manatees possess good hearing and sound localization abilities. The goals of this research were to determine the hearing abilities of two captive subjects and measure critical ratios to understand the capacity of manatees to detect tonal signals, such as manatee vocalizations, in the presence of noise. This study was also undertaken to better understand individual variability, which has been encountered during behavioral research with manatees. Two Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) were tested in a go/no-go paradigm using a modified staircase method, with incorporated ‘catch’ trials at a 1:1 ratio, to assess their ability to detect single-frequency tonal stimuli. The behavioral audiograms indicated that the manatees’ auditory frequency detection for tonal stimuli ranged from 0.25 to 90.5 kHz, with peak sensitivity extending from 8 to 32 kHz. Critical ratios, thresholds for tone detection in the presence of background masking noise, were determined with one-octave wide noise bands, 7–12 dB (spectrum level) above the thresholds determined for the audiogram under quiet conditions. Manatees appear to have quite low critical ratios, especially at 8 kHz, where the ratio was 18.3 dB for one manatee. This suggests that manatee hearing is sensitive in the presence of background noise and that they may have relatively narrow filters in the tested frequency range."},{"title":"Statistical parametric mapping of the regional distribution and ontogenetic scaling of foot pressures during walking in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1584","abstract":"Foot pressure distributions during locomotion have causal links with the anatomical and structural configurations of the foot tissues and the mechanics of locomotion. Elephant feet have five toes bound in a flexible pad of fibrous tissue (digital cushion). Does this specialized foot design control peak foot pressures in such giant animals? And how does body size, such as during ontogenetic growth, influence foot pressures? We addressed these questions by studying foot pressure distributions in elephant feet and their correlation with body mass and centre of pressure trajectories, using statistical parametric mapping (SPM), a neuro-imaging technology. Our results show a positive correlation between body mass and peak pressures, with the highest pressures dominated by the distal ends of the lateral toes (digits 3, 4 and 5). We also demonstrate that pressure reduction in the elephant digital cushion is a complex interaction of its viscoelastic tissue structure and its centre of pressure trajectories, because there is a tendency to avoid rear ‘heel’ contact as an elephant grows. Using SPM, we present a complete map of pressure distributions in elephant feet during ontogeny by performing statistical analysis at the pixel level across the entire plantar/palmar surface. We hope that our study will build confidence in the potential clinical and scaling applications of mammalian foot pressures, given our findings in support of a link between regional peak pressures and pathogenesis in elephant feet."},{"title":"Prolonged fasting increases purine recycling in post-weaned northern elephant seals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1448","abstract":"Northern elephant seals are naturally adapted to prolonged periods (1–2 months) of absolute food and water deprivation (fasting). In terrestrial mammals, food deprivation stimulates ATP degradation and decreases ATP synthesis, resulting in the accumulation of purines (ATP degradation byproducts). Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) salvages ATP by recycling the purine degradation products derived from xanthine oxidase (XO) metabolism, which also promotes oxidant production. The contributions of HGPRT to purine recycling during prolonged food deprivation in marine mammals are not well defined. In the present study we cloned and characterized the complete and partial cDNA sequences that encode for HGPRT and xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) in northern elephant seals. We also measured XO protein expression and circulating activity, along with xanthine and hypoxanthine plasma content in fasting northern elephant seal pups. Blood, adipose and muscle tissue samples were collected from animals after 1, 3, 5 and 7 weeks of their natural post-weaning fast. The complete HGPRT and partial XOR cDNA sequences are 771 and 345 bp long and encode proteins of 218 and 115 amino acids, respectively, with conserved domains important for their function and regulation. XOR mRNA and XO protein expression increased 3-fold and 1.7-fold with fasting, respectively, whereas HGPRT mRNA (4-fold) and protein (2-fold) expression increased after 7 weeks in adipose tissue and muscle. Plasma xanthine (3-fold) and hypoxanthine (2.5-fold) levels, and XO (1.7- to 20-fold) and HGPRT (1.5- to 1.7-fold) activities increased during the last 2 weeks of fasting. Results suggest that prolonged fasting in elephant seal pups is associated with increased capacity to recycle purines, which may contribute to ameliorating oxidant production and enhancing the supply of ATP, both of which would be beneficial during prolonged food deprivation and appear to be adaptive in this species."},{"title":"Independently evolved upper jaw protrusion mechanisms show convergent hydrodynamic function in teleost fishes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1456","abstract":"A protrusible upper jaw has independently evolved multiple times within teleosts and has been implicated in the success of two groups in particular: Acanthomorpha and Cypriniformes. We use digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) to compare suction feeding flow dynamics in a representative of each of these clades: goldfish and bluegill. Using DPIV, we contrast the spatial pattern of flow, the temporal relationship between flow and head kinematics, and the contribution of jaw protrusion to the forces exerted on prey. As expected, the spatial patterns of flow were similar in the two species. However, goldfish were slower to reach maximal kinematic excursions, and were more flexible in the relative timing of jaw protrusion, other jaw movements and suction flows. Goldfish were also able to sustain flow speeds for a prolonged period of time as compared with bluegill, in part because goldfish generate lower peak flow speeds. In both species, jaw protrusion increased the force exerted on the prey. However, slower jaw protrusion in goldfish resulted in less augmentation of suction forces. This difference in force exerted on prey corresponds with differences in trophic niches and feeding behavior of the two species. The bluegill uses powerful suction to capture insect larvae whereas the goldfish uses winnowing to sort through detritus and sediment. The kinethmoid of goldfish may permit jaw protrusion that is independent of lower jaw movement, which could explain the ability of goldfish to decouple suction flows (due to buccal expansion) from upper jaw protrusion. Nevertheless, our results show that jaw protrusion allows both species to augment the force exerted on prey, suggesting that this is a fundamental benefit of jaw protrusion to suction feeders."},{"title":"Experimental evaluation of the anti-attachment effect of microalgal mats on grazing activity of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus nudus in oscillating flows","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1464","abstract":"Algal mats can hinder the adhesion of the tube feet of sea urchins. This leads to the hypothesis that the restriction of sea urchin feeding activity by wave action can potentially be enhanced by the presence of algal mats, which will facilitate the survival of kelp recruits at sites with wave action in urchin barrens. To evaluate the potential anti-attachment effect of algal mats on sea urchins, a laboratory tank experiment was performed on the movement of Strongylocentrotus nudus sea urchins and their grazing on juvenile kelp plants at the center of 30×30 cm flat test substrates with or without a thin-layer microalgal mat at four levels of oscillatory flow (maximum orbital velocity: 10, 20, 30 and 40 cm s–1). The grazing loss of kelp slightly increased with increasing velocity up to 30 cm s–1 in the absence of microalgal mats, while in contrast the loss substantially decreased at 30 cm s–1 in their presence. Sea urchins were dislodged more frequently at 20 cm s–1 or higher velocities in the presence of microalgal mats. Mats were frequently abraded by scraping by the adoral spines during urchin movement at high velocities (30 and 40 cm s–1) but were subject to no or only slight urchin grazing in most cases. The results indicate that the overall decrease in grazing loss of kelp within the microalgal mats was attributable to the anti-attachment effect on urchins during incursions rather than due to urchins grazing on the mats."},{"title":"Extending food deprivation reverses the short-term lipolytic response to fasting: role of the triacylglycerol/fatty acid cycle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1484","abstract":"The effects of short-term food deprivation on lipid metabolism are well documented, but little is known about prolonged fasting. This study monitored the kinetics of glycerol (rate of appearance, Ra glycerol) and non-esterified fatty acids (Ra NEFA) in fasting rabbits. Our goals were to determine whether lipolysis is stimulated beyond values seen for short-term fasting, and to characterize the roles of primary (intracellular) and secondary (with transit through the circulation) triacylglycerol/fatty acid cycling (TAG/FA cycling) in regulating fatty acid allocation to oxidation or re-esterification. Ra glycerol (9.62±0.72 to 15.29±0.96 μmol kg–1 min–1) and Ra NEFA (18.05±2.55 to 31.25±1.93 μmol kg–1 min–1) were stimulated during the first 2 days of fasting, but returned to baseline after 4 days. An initial increase in TAG/FA cycling was followed by a reduction below baseline after 6 days without food, with primary and secondary cycling contributing to these responses. We conclude that the classic activation of lipolysis caused by short-term fasting is abolished when food deprivation is prolonged. High rates of re-esterification may become impossible to sustain, and TAG/FA cycling could decrease to reduce its cost to 3% of total energy expenditure. Throughout prolonged fasting, fatty acid metabolism gradually shifts towards increased oxidation and reduced re-esterification. Survival is achieved by pressing fuel selection towards the fatty acid dominance of energy metabolism and by slowing substrate cycles to assist metabolic suppression. However, TAG/FA cycling remains active even after prolonged fasting, suggesting that re-esterification is a crucial mechanism that cannot be stopped without harmful consequences."},{"title":"Transport of selenium across the plasma membrane of primary hepatocytes and enterocytes of rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1491","abstract":"Transport of essential solutes across biological membranes is one of the fundamental characteristics of living cells. Although selenium is an essential micronutrient, little is known about the cellular mechanisms of chemical species-specific selenium transport in fish. We report here the kinetic and pharmacological transport characteristics of selenite and its thiol (glutathione and l-cysteine) derivatives in primary cultures of hepatocytes and isolated enterocytes of rainbow trout. Findings from the current study suggest an apparent low-affinity linear transport system for selenite in both cell types. However, we recorded high-affinity Hill kinetics (Kd=3.61±0.28 μmol l–1) in enterocytes exposed to selenite in the presence of glutathione. The uptake of selenite in the presence of thiols was severalfold higher than uptake of selenite alone (at equimolar concentration) in both hepatocytes and enterocytes. Cellular accumulation of selenium was found to be energy independent. Interestingly, we observed a decrease in selenite transport with increasing pH, whereas selenite uptake increased with increasing pH in the presence glutathione in both cell types. The cellular uptake of selenite demonstrated a pronounced competitive interaction with a structurally similar compound, sulfite. The uptake of selenite as well as its thiol derivatives was found to be sensitive to the anion transport blocker DIDS, irrespective of the cell type. Inorganic mercury (Hg2+) elicited an inhibition of selenite transport in both cell types, but augmented the transport of reduced forms of selenite in hepatocytes. Based on the substrate choice and comparable pharmacological properties, we advocate that multiple anion transport systems are probably involved in the cellular transport of selenite in fish."},{"title":"Differential limb loading in miniature pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus): a test of chondral modeling theory","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1472","abstract":"Variation in mechanical loading is known to influence chondrogenesis during joint formation. However, the interaction among chondrocyte behavior and variation in activity patterns is incompletely understood, hindering our knowledge of limb ontogeny and function. Here, the role of endurance exercise in the development of articular and physeal cartilage in the humeral head was examined in 14 miniature swine (Sus scrofa domesticus). One group was subjected to graded treadmill running over a period of 17 weeks. A matched sedentary group was confined to individual pens. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed for histomorphometry of cartilage zone thickness, chondrocyte count and cell area, with these parameters compared multivariately between exercised and sedentary groups. Comparisons were also made with femora from the same sample, focusing on humerus–femur differences between exercised and sedentary groups, within-cohort comparisons of humerus–femur responses and correlated changes within and across joints. This study shows conflicting support for the chondral modeling theory. The humeral articular cartilage of exercised pigs was thinner than that of sedentary pigs, but their physeal cartilage was thicker. While articular and physeal cartilage demonstrated between-cohort differences, humeral physeal cartilage exhibited load-induced responses of greater magnitude than humeral articular cartilage. Controlling for cohort, the humerus showed increased chondrocyte mitosis and cell area, presumably due to relatively greater loading than the femur. This represents the first known effort to evaluate chondral modeling across multiple joints from the same individuals. Our findings suggest the chondral response to elevated loading is complex, varying within and among joints. This has important implications for understanding joint biomechanics and development."},{"title":"Fracture toughness of locust cuticle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1502","abstract":"Insect cuticle is one of the most common biological materials, yet very little is known about its mechanical properties. Many parts of the insect exoskeleton, such as the jumping legs of locusts, have to withstand high and repeated loading without failure. This paper presents the first measurements of fracture toughness for insect cuticle using a standard engineering approach. Our results show that the fracture toughness of cuticle in locust hind legs is 4.12 MPa m1/2 and decreases with desiccation of the cuticle. Stiffness and strength of the tibia cuticle were measured using buckling and cantilever bending and increased with desiccation. A combination of the cuticle’s high toughness with a relatively low stiffness of 3.05 GPa results in a work of fracture of 5.56 kJ m–2, which is amongst the highest of any biological material, giving the insect leg an exceptional ability to tolerate defects such as cracks and damage. Interestingly, insect cuticle achieves these unique properties without using reinforcement by a mineral phase, which is often found in other biological composite materials. These findings thus might inspire the development of new biomimetic composite materials."},{"title":"Minimum cost of transport in Asian elephants: do we really need a bigger elephant?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1509","abstract":"Body mass is the primary determinant of an animal’s energy requirements. At their optimum walking speed, large animals have lower mass-specific energy requirements for locomotion than small ones. In animals ranging in size from 0.8 g (roach) to 260 kg (zebu steer), the minimum cost of transport (COTmin) decreases with increasing body size roughly as COTmin∝body mass (Mb)–0.316±0.023 (95% CI). Typically, the variation of COTmin with body mass is weaker at the intraspecific level as a result of physiological and geometric similarity within closely related species. The interspecific relationship estimates that an adult elephant, with twice the body mass of a mid-sized elephant, should be able to move its body approximately 23% cheaper than the smaller elephant. We sought to determine whether adult Asian and sub-adult African elephants follow a single quasi-intraspecific relationship, and extend the interspecific relationship between COTmin and body mass to 12-fold larger animals. Physiological and possibly geometric similarity between adult Asian elephants and sub-adult African elephants caused body mass to have a no effect on COTmin (COTmin∝Mb0.007±0.455). The COTmin in elephants occurred at walking speeds between 1.3 and ∼1.5 m s–1, and at Froude numbers between 0.10 and 0.24. The addition of adult Asian elephants to the interspecific relationship resulted in COTmin∝M –0.277±0.046b. The quasi-intraspecific relationship between body mass and COTmin among elephants caused the interspecific relationship to underestimate COTmin in larger elephants."},{"title":"Head and body stabilization in blowflies walking on differently structured substrates","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1523","abstract":"Visually guided animals depend heavily on the quality of visual signals in order to obtain functionally relevant information about their environment. To support visual information processing, nature has evolved a large variety of physiological adaptations and behavioral strategies such as compensatory head movements. During self-movement, head rotations compensate for changes in body attitude in order to stabilize gaze. However, how walking animals cope with uneven structured substrates, which may affect body and gaze orientation, is still unknown. We used stereo high-speed video to analyze compensatory head movements of blowflies walking freely on differently structured substrates. We found that even a pronounced asperity of the ground structure, with bumps of almost the size of the animal, was largely compensated by the walking apparatus of the blowfly, which leads to body roll and pitch movements only marginally larger than those on flat substrate. Pitch and roll fluctuations of the head were smaller compared with body fluctuations on all tested substrates, emphasizing the significance of gaze stabilization during walking on structured substrates. Furthermore, we found no impairment in head and body stabilization during walks in darkness, which indicates that the control system mediating compensatory head movements works well without any visual input. Interestingly, blowflies changed their walking style in the dark and seemed to use their forelegs as tactile probes."},{"title":"Control of d-octopine formation in scallop adductor muscle as revealed through thermodynamic studies of octopine dehydrogenase","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1515","abstract":"Octopine dehydrogenase (OcDH) from the adductor muscle of the great scallop, Pecten maximus (Linné, 1758), catalyses the NADH-dependent condensation of l-arginine and pyruvate to d-octopine, NAD+ and water during escape swimming and subsequent recovery. During exercise, ATP is mainly provided by the transphosphorylation of phospho-l-arginine and to some extent by anaerobic glycolysis. NADH resulting from the glycolytic oxidation of 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is reoxidized during d-octopine formation. In some scallops d-octopine starts to accumulate during prolonged, strong muscular work, whereas in other species d-octopine formation commences towards the end of swimming and continues to rise during subsequent recovery. The activity of OcDH is regulated by a mandatory, consecutive mode of substrate binding in the order NADH, l-arginine and pyruvate, as demonstrated by isothermal titration calorimetry. The first regulatory step in the forward reaction comprises the binding of NADH to OcDH with a dissociation constant Kd of 0.014±0.006 mmol l–1, which reflects a high affinity and tight association of the apoenzyme with the co-substrate. In the reverse direction, NAD+ binds first with a Kd of 0.20±0.004 mmol l–1 followed by d-octopine. The binary OcDH–NADH complex associates with l-arginine with a Kd of 5.5±0.05 mmol l–1. Only this ternary complex combines with pyruvate, with an estimated Kd of approximately 0.8 mmol l–1 as deduced from pyruvate concentrations determined in the muscle of exhausted scallops. At tissue concentrations of pyruvate between 0.5 and 1.2 mmol l–1 in the valve adductor muscle of fatigued P. maximus, binding of pyruvate to OcDH plays the most decisive role in initiating OcDH activity and, therefore, in controlling the onset of d-octopine formation."},{"title":"Olfactory coding in five moth species from two families","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1542","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to determine what impact phylogeny and life history might have on the coding of odours in the brain.

Our results suggest that even between the two phylogenetically distant moth families, basic olfactory coding features are similar. But we also found different coding strategies in the moths’ antennal lobe; namely, more specific patterns for chemically similar odorants in the two noctuid species than in the three sphingid species tested. This difference demonstrates the impact of the phylogenetic distance between species from different families despite some parallel life history traits found in both families. Furthermore, pronounced differences in larval and adult diet among the sphingids did not translate into differences in the olfactory code; instead, the three species had almost identical coding patterns."},{"title":"Active electrolocation in pulse gymnotids: sensory consequences of objects’ mutual polarization","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/9/1533","abstract":"We examined non-linear effects of the presence of one object on the electric image of another placed at the foveal region in Gymnotus omarorum. The sensory consequences of object mutual polarization on electric images were also depicted using behavioral procedures. Image measurements show that objects whose electric image is not detectable may modify the electric image of another placed closer to the fish and suggest that detection range and discrimination parameters used for one object may be affected when the presence of others enriches the scene. Behavioral experiments confirm that these changes in object images resulting from mutual polarization may be exploited for improving perception. While conductive objects close to the skin allow the fish to detect other objects placed out of the active electrodetection range, non-conductive objects may hide objects that otherwise show clear electric images. This suggests that fish movements may orient the self-generated field to exploit object mutual polarization, increasing or decreasing the active electrolocation range. In addition, images of a nearby object may be modulated by the presence of another object placed outside the detection range and the corresponding behavioral responses suggest that a moving or impedance-changing context may modify a fish’s discrimination abilities for closer objects."},{"title":"The metabolism of histamine in the Drosophila optic lobe involves an ommatidial pathway: β-alanine recycles through the retina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1399","abstract":"Flies recycle the photoreceptor neurotransmitter histamine by conjugating it to β-alanine to form β-alanyl-histamine (carcinine). The conjugation is regulated by Ebony, while Tan hydrolyses carcinine, releasing histamine and β-alanine. In Drosophila, β-alanine synthesis occurs either from uracil or from the decarboxylation of aspartate but detailed roles for the enzymes responsible remain unclear. Immunohistochemically detected β-alanine is present throughout the fly’s entire brain, and is enhanced in the retina especially in the pseudocone, pigment and photoreceptor cells of the ommatidia. HPLC determinations reveal 10.7 ng of β-alanine in the wild-type head, roughly five times more than histamine. When wild-type flies drink uracil their head β-alanine increases more than after drinking l-aspartic acid, indicating the effectiveness of the uracil pathway. Mutants of black, which lack aspartate decarboxylase, cannot synthesize β-alanine from l-aspartate but can still synthesize it efficiently from uracil. Our findings demonstrate a novel function for pigment cells, which not only screen ommatidia from stray light but also store and transport β-alanine and carcinine. This role is consistent with a β-alanine-dependent histamine recycling pathway occurring not only in the photoreceptor terminals in the lamina neuropile, where carcinine occurs in marginal glia, but vertically via a long pathway that involves the retina. The lamina’s marginal glia are also a hub involved in the storage and/or disposal of carcinine and β-alanine."},{"title":"Evaporation dynamics of tarsal liquid footprints in flies (Calliphora vicina)and beetles (Coccinella septempunctata)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1266","abstract":"Insect tarsal adhesive structures secrete a thin layer of fluid into the contact area. It was previously reported that the presence of this fluid significantly increases adhesion on various substrata. Previous data obtained from representatives of different insect groups suggest a difference not only in the chemical composition of the fluid, but also in its physical properties. In the present study, we have measured for the first time changes in the droplet geometry over time and the evaporation rate of the fluid in flies (Calliphora vicina) and beetles (Coccinella septempunctata) by the use of atomic force microscopy. Flattened droplets of the beetle had lower evaporation rates than hemispherical footprints of the fly. Within 1 h, the droplet volume reduced to 21% of the initial volume for the fly, and to 65% for the beetle, suggesting a larger fraction of volatile compounds in the fly fluid. It was revealed that drop geometry changes significantly during evaporation and shows pinning effects for the fly footprints due to an assumed self-organizing oil layer on top of the water fraction of the micro-emulsion. The data obtained suggest that the adhesion strength in capillarity-based switchable adhesive systems must be time-dependent because of the specific evaporation rate of the adhesive fluid. These results are important for our understanding of the functional mechanism of insect adhesive systems and also for biomimetics of artificial capillarity-based adhesive systems."},{"title":"Not all sugars are created equal: some mask aversive tastes better than others in an herbivorous insect","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1412","abstract":"Manduca sexta caterpillars are unusual because they exhibit strong peripheral gustatory responses to sugars, but nevertheless fail to show immediate appetitive responses to them. We hypothesized that the primary function of the peripheral gustatory response to sugars is to mask the taste of noxious compounds, which abound in host plants of M. sexta. We compared 10 s biting responses to water with those to mixtures of a noxious compound [caffeine (Caf) or aristolochic acid (AA)] and various combinations of sugars [i.e. sucrose (Suc), glucose (Glu), inositol (Ino), Suc+Glu, Suc+Ino or Glu+Ino]. The biting assays indicated that the aversive taste of AA was completely masked by Suc+Ino, and partially masked by Suc+Glu, Glu+Ino and Suc, whereas that of Caf was completely masked by Suc+Ino and Suc+Glu, and partially masked by Glu+Ino, Suc and Ino. To examine the contribution of the peripheral taste system to the masking phenomenon, we recorded responses of the maxillary gustatory sensilla to each stimulus mixture. The sugars differed greatly in their capacity to suppress peripheral gustatory responses to AA and Caf: Suc+Ino and Suc+Glu produced the greatest suppression, and Glu and Ino the least. Further, the extent to which each sugar stimulus suppressed the peripheral gustatory responses to AA reliably predicted the extent to which it masked the taste of AA in biting assays; no such predictive relationship was observed for the sugar/Caf mixtures. We conclude that some, but not all, sugars act on both peripheral and central elements of the gustatory system to mask the taste of noxious compounds."},{"title":"Digesting blood of an auxiliary host in fleas: effect of phylogenetic distance from a principal host","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1259","abstract":"Fleas are haematophagous ectoparasites that exhibit varying degrees of host specificity. Flea abundance is highest on principal hosts and lower on auxiliary hosts but may vary greatly among auxiliary hosts. We investigated the feeding and energy expenditure for digestion in two flea species Parapulex chephrenis and Xenopsylla ramesis on a principal host (Acomys cahirinus and Meriones crassus, respectively) and eight auxiliary host species. We predicted that fleas would perform better – that is (i) a higher proportion of fleas would take a blood meal, (ii) fleas would take larger blood meals and (iii) fleas would spend less energy on digestion – if they fed on (i) a principal host compared with an auxiliary host and (ii) an auxiliary host phylogenetically close to a principal host compared with an auxiliary host phylogenetically distant from a principal host. Energy costs of digestion were estimated using CO2 emission and represented energy cost during the first stage of blood digestion. Contrary to our predictions, fleas did not always perform better on a principal than on an auxiliary host or on auxiliary hosts phylogenetically closer to the principal host than on auxiliary hosts phylogenetically distant from a principal host. Variation in flea feeding performance may result from the interplay of several factors including co-occurrence between hosts and susceptibility of a host to flea attacks, the species-specific level of immunocompetence of a host and the level of host specificity of a flea. This study describes the first investigation into the metabolic expenditure of parasitism and its relationship to phylogenetic relationships amongst hosts."},{"title":"Blue-light-receptive cryptochrome is expressed in a sponge eye lacking neurons and opsin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1278","abstract":"Many larval sponges possess pigment ring eyes that apparently mediate phototactic swimming. Yet sponges are not known to possess nervous systems or opsin genes, so the unknown molecular components of sponge phototaxis must differ fundamentally from those in other animals, inspiring questions about how this sensory system functions. Here we present molecular and biochemical data on cryptochrome, a candidate gene for functional involvement in sponge pigment ring eyes. We report that Amphimedon queenslandica, a demosponge, possesses two cryptochrome/photolyase genes, Aq-Cry1 and Aq-Cry2. The mRNA of one gene (Aq-Cry2) is expressed in situ at the pigment ring eye. Additionally, we report that Aq-Cry2 lacks photolyase activity and contains a flavin-based co-factor that is responsive to wavelengths of light that also mediate larval photic behavior. These results suggest that Aq-Cry2 may act in the aneural, opsin-less phototaxic behavior of a sponge."},{"title":"Relative contributions of pigments and biophotonic nanostructures to natural color production: a case study in budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) feathers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1272","abstract":"Understanding the mechanistic bases of natural color diversity can provide insight into its evolution and inspiration for biomimetic optical structures. Metazoans can be colored by absorption of light from pigments or by scattering of light from biophotonic nanostructures, and these mechanisms have largely been treated as distinct. However, the interactions between them have rarely been examined. Captive breeding of budgerigars (Aves, Psittacidae, Melopsittacus undulatus) has produced a wide variety of color morphs spanning the majority of the spectrum visible to birds, including the ultraviolet, and thus they have been used as examples of hypothesized structure–pigment interactions. However, empirical data testing these interactions in this excellent model system are lacking. Here we used ultraviolet–visible spectrometry, light and electron microscopy, pigment extraction experiments and optical modeling to examine the physical bases of color production in seven budgerigar morphs, including grey and chromatic (purple to yellow) colors. Feathers from all morphs contained quasi-ordered air–keratin ‘spongy layer’ matrices, but these were highly reduced and irregular in grey and yellow feathers. Similarly, all feathers but yellow and grey had a layer of melanin-containing melanosomes basal to the spongy layer. The presence of melanosomes likely increases color saturation produced by spongy layers whereas their absence may allow increased expression of yellow colors. Finally, extraction of yellow pigments caused some degree of color change in all feathers except purple and grey, suggesting that their presence and contribution to color production is more widespread than previously thought. These data illustrate how interactions between structures and pigments can increase the range of colors attainable in birds and potentially in synthetic systems."},{"title":"Do ants need to be old and experienced to teach?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1287","abstract":"Learning is widespread in invertebrates. However, whether social insects improve their recruitment skills with experience is only beginning to be investigated. Tandem running is a one-to-one form of recruitment used by certain species of ant. It is a remarkable communication system that meets widely accepted criteria for teaching in non-human animals. Here, we determined experimentally to what extent participation in, and efficient execution of, tandem running depends on either the age or the experience of worker ants. To investigate these issues, we constructed colonies of the ant Temnothorax albipennis with different compositions of inexperienced and experienced workers from different age cohorts and then examined which ants participated in tandem runs when they emigrated. Our results show that the ability to participate actively in recruitment by tandem running is present in all worker age groups but the propensity to participate varies with experience rather than age per se. Experienced individuals were more likely to engage in tandem runs, either as leaders or as followers, than young inexperienced individuals, and older experienced ants were more likely to lead tandems than older inexperienced ants. Young inexperienced ants led faster, more rapidly dispersing and less accurately orientated tandem runs than the older experienced ants. Our study suggests that experience (rather than age per se) coupled to stimulus threshold responses might interact to promote a division of labour so that a suitable number of workers actively participate in tandem runs."},{"title":"Salinity- and population-dependent genome regulatory response during osmotic acclimation in the killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) gill","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1293","abstract":"The killifish Fundulus heteroclitus is abundant in osmotically dynamic estuaries and it can quickly adjust to extremes in environmental salinity. We performed a comparative osmotic challenge experiment to track the transcriptomic and physiological responses to two salinities throughout a time course of acclimation, and to explore the genome regulatory mechanisms that enable extreme osmotic acclimation. One southern and one northern coastal population, known to differ in their tolerance to hypo-osmotic exposure, were used as our comparative model. Both populations could maintain osmotic homeostasis when transferred from 32 to 0.4 p.p.t., but diverged in their compensatory abilities when challenged down to 0.1 p.p.t., in parallel with divergent transformation of gill morphology. Genes involved in cell volume regulation, nucleosome maintenance, ion transport, energetics, mitochondrion function, transcriptional regulation and apoptosis showed population- and salinity-dependent patterns of expression during acclimation. Network analysis confirmed the role of cytokine and kinase signaling pathways in coordinating the genome regulatory response to osmotic challenge, and also posited the importance of signaling coordinated through the transcription factor HNF-4α. These genome responses support hypotheses of which regulatory mechanisms are particularly relevant for enabling extreme physiological flexibility."},{"title":"Active echolocation beam focusing in the false killer whale, Pseudorca crassidens","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1306","abstract":"The odontocete sound production system is highly complex and produces intense, directional signals that are thought to be focused by the melon and the air sacs. Because odontocete echolocation signals are variable and the emitted click frequency greatly affects the echolocation beam shape, investigations of beam focusing must account for frequency-related beam changes. In this study we tested whether the echolocation beam of a false killer whale changed depending on target difficulty and distance while also accounting for frequency-related changes in the echolocation beam. The data indicate that the false killer whale changes its beam size according to target distance and difficulty, which may be a strategy of maximizing the energy of the target echo. We propose that the animal is using a strategy of changing the focal region according to target distance and that this strategy is under active control."},{"title":"The contribution of air breathing to aerobic scope and exercise performance in the banded knifefish Gymnotus carapo L.","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1323","abstract":"The contribution of air breathing to aerobic metabolic scope and exercise performance was investigated in a teleost with bimodal respiration, the banded knifefish, submitted to a critical swimming speed (Ucrit) protocol at 30°C. Seven individuals (mean ± s.e.m. mass 89±7 g, total length 230±4 mm) achieved a Ucrit of 2.1±1 body lengths (BL) s–1 and an active metabolic rate (AMR) of 350±21 mg kg–1 h–1, with 38±6% derived from air breathing. All of the knifefish exhibited a significant increase in air-breathing frequency (fAB) with swimming speed. If denied access to air in normoxia, these individuals achieved a Ucrit of 2.0±0.2 BL s–1 and an AMR of 368±24 mg kg–1 h–1 by gill ventilation alone. In normoxia, therefore, the contribution of air breathing to scope and exercise was entirely facultative. In aquatic hypoxia (PO2=4 kPa) with access to normoxic air, the knifefish achieved a Ucrit of 2.0±0.1 BL s–1 and an AMR of 338±29 mg kg–1 h–1, similar to aquatic normoxia, but with 55±5% of AMR derived from air breathing. Indeed, fAB was higher than in normoxia at all swimming speeds, with a profound exponential increase during exercise. If the knifefish were denied access to air in hypoxia, Ucrit declined to 1.2±0.1 BL s–1 and AMR declined to 199±29 mg kg–1 h–1. Therefore, air breathing allowed the knifefish to avoid limitations to aerobic scope and exercise performance in aquatic hypoxia."},{"title":"Wired to run: exercise-induced endocannabinoid signaling in humans and cursorial mammals with implications for the ‘runner’s high’","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1331","abstract":"Humans report a wide range of neurobiological rewards following moderate and intense aerobic activity, popularly referred to as the ‘runner’s high’, which may function to encourage habitual aerobic exercise. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are endogenous neurotransmitters that appear to play a major role in generating these rewards by activating cannabinoid receptors in brain reward regions during and after exercise. Other species also regularly engage in endurance exercise (cursorial mammals), and as humans share many morphological traits with these taxa, it is possible that exercise-induced eCB signaling motivates habitual high-intensity locomotor behaviors in cursorial mammals. If true, then neurobiological rewards may explain variation in habitual locomotor activity and performance across mammals. We measured circulating eCBs in humans, dogs (a cursorial mammal) and ferrets (a non-cursorial mammal) before and after treadmill exercise to test the hypothesis that neurobiological rewards are linked to high-intensity exercise in cursorial mammals. We show that humans and dogs share significantly increased exercise-induced eCB signaling following high-intensity endurance running. eCB signaling does not significantly increase following low-intensity walking in these taxa, and eCB signaling does not significantly increase in the non-cursorial ferrets following exercise at any intensity. This study provides the first evidence that inter-specific variation in neurotransmitter signaling may explain differences in locomotor behavior among mammals. Thus, a neurobiological reward for endurance exercise may explain why humans and other cursorial mammals habitually engage in aerobic exercise despite the higher associated energy costs and injury risks, and why non-cursorial mammals avoid such locomotor behaviors."},{"title":"Honey bee drones maintain humoral immune competence throughout all life stages in the absence of vitellogenin production","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1313","abstract":"Drones are haploid male individuals whose major social function in honey bee colonies is to produce sperm and mate with a queen. In spite of their limited tasks, the vitality of drones is of utmost importance for the next generation. The immune competence of drones – as compared to worker bees – is largely unexplored. Hence, we studied humoral and cellular immune reactions of in vitro reared drone larvae and adult drones of different age upon artificial bacterial infection. Haemolymph samples were collected after aseptic and septic injury and subsequently employed for (1) the identification of immune-responsive peptides and/or proteins by qualitative proteomic analyses in combination with mass spectrometry and (2) the detection of antimicrobial activity by inhibition-zone assays. Drone larvae and adult drones responded with a strong humoral immune reaction upon bacterial challenge, as validated by the expression of small antimicrobial peptides. Young adult drones exhibited a broader spectrum of defence reactions than drone larvae. Distinct polypeptides including peptidoglycan recognition protein-S2 and lysozyme 2 were upregulated in immunized adult drones. Moreover, a pronounced nodulation reaction was observed in young drones upon bacterial challenge. Prophenoloxidase zymogen is present at an almost constant level in non-infected adult drones throughout the entire lifespan. All observed immune reactions in drones were expressed in the absence of significant amounts of vitellogenin. We conclude that drones – like worker bees – have the potential to activate multiple elements of the innate immune response."},{"title":"Intracellular pH regulation in unstimulated Calliphora salivary glands is Na+ dependent and requires V-ATPase activity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1337","abstract":"Salivary gland cells of the blowfly Calliphora vicina have a vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) that lies in their apical membrane and energizes the secretion of a KCl-rich primary saliva upon stimulation with serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). Whether and to what extent V-ATPase contributes to intracellular pH (pHi) regulation in unstimulated gland cells is unknown. We used the fluorescent dye BCECF to study intracellular pHi regulation microfluorometrically and show that: (1) under resting conditions, the application of Na+-free physiological saline induces an intracellular alkalinization attributable to the inhibition of the activity of a Na+-dependent glutamate transporter; (2) the maintenance of resting pHi is Na+, Cl–, concanamycin A and DIDS sensitive; (3) recovery from an intracellular acid load is Na+ sensitive and requires V-ATPase activity; (4) the Na+/H+ antiporter is not involved in pHi recovery after a NH4Cl prepulse; and (5) at least one Na+-dependent transporter and the V-ATPase maintain recovery from an intracellular acid load. Thus, under resting conditions, the V-ATPase and at least one Na+-dependent transporter maintain normal pHi values of pH 7.5. We have also detected the presence of a Na+-dependent glutamate transporter, which seems to act as an acid loader. Despite this not being a common pHi-regulating transporter, its activity affects steady-state pHi in C. vicina salivary gland cells."},{"title":"Maternal influences on early development: preferred temperature prior to oviposition hastens embryogenesis and enhances offspring traits in the Children’s python, Antaresia childreni","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1346","abstract":"Embryonic life is particularly sensitive to its surroundings, and the developmental environment can have long-lasting effects on offspring. In oviparous species, the impacts of the developmental environment on offspring traits are mostly examined during development within the egg. However, as more than 25% of the development of squamate reptiles can occur prior to oviposition, we explored the effect of thermal conditions on development prior to oviposition in an oviparous snake species, the Children’s python (Antaresia childreni). We housed gravid female pythons under three thermal cycles: an optimal regime that reflected maternal preference in a non-constrained environment (constant preferred body temperature of gravid females, Tset=31.5°C) and two mildly suboptimal regimes that shared the same mean temperature of 27.7°C, but differed in the duration at Tset. In one of the constraining regimes, females had access to Tset for 4 h daily whereas in the other regime, females never reached Tset (maximal temperature of 29.0°C). Thermal treatments were maintained throughout gravidity in all three groups, but, after oviposition, all eggs were incubated at Tset until hatching. Compared with the optimal regime, the two suboptimal regimes had a longer duration of gravidity, which resulted in delayed hatching. Between the two suboptimal regimes, gravidity was significantly shorter in the treatment that included time at Tset. Furthermore, suboptimal regimes influenced offspring traits at hatching, including body morphology, antipredator behavior, strength and metabolism. However, partial access to maternal Tset significantly enhanced several offspring traits, including performance. Our results demonstrate the importance of time at Tset on early development and suggest an adaptive significance of maternal thermoregulation prior to oviposition."},{"title":"Metabolism and energy supply below the critical thermal minimum of a chill-susceptible insect","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1366","abstract":"When exposed to temperatures below their critical thermal minimum (CTmin), insects enter chill-coma and accumulate chilling injuries. While the critical thermal limits of water-breathing marine animals may be caused by oxygen- and capacity-limitation of thermal tolerance (OCLT), the mechanisms are poorly understood in air-breathing terrestrial insects. We used thermolimit respirometry to characterize entry into chill-coma in a laboratory population of fall field crickets (Gryllus pennsylvanicus). To detect potential oxygen limitation, we quantified muscle ATP, lactate and alanine concentrations in crickets following prolonged exposure to 0°C (a temperature that causes chill-coma, chilling injury and eventual death). Although there was a sharp (44%) drop in the rate of CO2 emission at the CTmin and spiracular control was lost, there was a low, continuous rate of CO2 release throughout chill-coma, indicating that the spiracles were open and gas exchange could occur through the tracheal system. Prolonged exposure to 0°C caused muscle ATP levels to increase marginally (rather than decrease as OCLT would predict), and there was no change in muscle lactate or alanine concentration. Thus, it appears that insects are not susceptible to OCLT at low temperatures but that the CTmin may instead be set by temperature effects on whole-animal ion homeostasis."},{"title":"Exceptional cardiac anoxia tolerance in tilapia (Oreochromis hybrid)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1354","abstract":"Anoxic survival requires the matching of cardiac ATP supply (i.e. maximum glycolytic potential, MGP) and demand (i.e. cardiac power output, PO). We examined the idea that the previously observed in vivo downregulation of cardiac function during exposure to severe hypoxia in tilapia (Oreochromis hybrid) represents a physiological strategy to reduce routine PO to within the heart’s MGP. The MGP of the ectothermic vertebrate heart has previously been suggested to be ∼70 nmol ATP s–1 g–1, sustaining a PO of ∼0.7 mW g–1 at 15°C. We developed an in situ perfused heart preparation for tilapia (Oreochromis hybrid) and characterized the routine and maximum cardiac performance under both normoxic (>20 kPa O2) and severely hypoxic perfusion conditions (<0.20 kPa O2) at pH 7.75 and 22°C. The additive effects of acidosis (pH 7.25) and chemical anoxia (1 mmol l–1 NaCN) on cardiac performance in severe hypoxia were also examined. Under normoxic conditions, cardiac performance and myocardial oxygen consumption rate were comparable to those of other teleosts. The tilapia heart maintained a routine normoxic cardiac output (Q) and PO under all hypoxic conditions, a result that contrasts with the hypoxic cardiac downregulation previously observed in vivo under less severe conditions. Thus, we conclude that the in vivo downregulation of routine cardiac performance in hypoxia is not needed in tilapia to balance cardiac energy supply and demand. Indeed, the MGP of the tilapia heart proved to be quite exceptional. Measurements of myocardial lactate efflux during severe hypoxia were used to calculate the MGP of the tilapia heart. The MGP was estimated to be 172 nmol ATP s–1 g–1 at 22°C, and allowed the heart to generate a POmax of at least ∼3.1 mW g–1, which is only 30% lower than the POmax observed with normoxia. Even with this MGP, the additional challenge of acidosis during severe hypoxia decreased maximum ATP turnover rate and POmax by 30% compared with severe hypoxia alone, suggesting that there are probably direct effects of acidosis on cardiac contractility. We conclude that the high maximum glycolytic ATP turnover rate and levels of PO, which exceed those measured in other ectothermic vertebrate hearts, probably convey a previously unreported anoxia tolerance of the tilapia heart, but a tolerance that may be tempered in vivo by the accumulation of acidotic waste during anoxia."},{"title":"Adiponectin effects and gene expression in rainbow trout: an in vivo and in vitro approach","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1373","abstract":"Here we present the presence of adiponectin and adiponectin receptors [type 1 (adipoR1) and type 2 (adipoR2)] in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) tissues and cell cultures together with the response to different scenarios. In response to fasting, adiponectin expression was up-regulated in adipose tissue, while the expression of its receptors increased in white and red muscle. Insulin injection decreased adipoR1 expression in white and red muscles. We deduce that the adipoRs in trout muscle show opposite responses to increasing insulin plasma levels, which may maintain sensitivity to insulin in this tissue. Adiponectin expression was inhibited by the inflammatory effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in adipose tissue and red muscle. Moreover, results indicate that LPS may lead to mobilization of fat reserves, increasing adipoR1 expression in adipose tissue. The effects of LPS could be mediated through tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), at least in red muscle. Insulin, growth hormone and TNFα all diminished expression of adipoR2 in adipocytes and adipoR1 in myotubes, while insulin increased the expression of adipoR2 in the muscle cells. Adiponectin activates Akt in rainbow trout myotubes, which may lead to an increase in fatty acid uptake and oxidation. Overall, our results show that the adiponectin system responds differently to various physiological challenges and that it is hormonally controlled in vivo and in vitro. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this has been demonstrated in teleosts, and it may be a valuable contribution to our understanding of adipokines in fish."},{"title":"Autotrophic carbon budget in coral tissue: a new 13C-based model of photosynthate translocation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1384","abstract":"Corals live in symbiosis with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinum. These dinoflagellates translocate a large part of the photosynthetically fixed carbon to the host, which in turn uses it for its own needs. Assessing the carbon budget in coral tissue is a central question in reef studies that still vexes ecophysiologists. The amount of carbon fixed by the symbiotic association can be determined by measuring the rate of photosynthesis, but the amount of carbon translocated by the symbionts to the host and the fate of this carbon are more difficult to assess. In the present study, we propose a novel approach to calculate the budget of autotrophic carbon in the tissue of scleractinian corals, based on a new model and measurements made with the stable isotope 13C. Colonies of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata were incubated in H13CO –3-enriched seawater, after which the fate of 13C was followed in the symbionts, the coral tissue and the released particulate organic carbon (i.e. mucus). Results obtained showed that after 15 min, ca. 60% of the carbon fixed was already translocated to the host, and after 48 h, this value reached 78%. However, ca. 48% of the photosynthetically fixed carbon was respired by the symbiotic association, and 28% was released as dissolved organic carbon. This is different from other coral species, where <1% of the total organic carbon released is from newly fixed carbon. Only 23% of the initially fixed carbon was retained in the symbionts and coral tissue after 48 h. Results show that our 13C-based model could successfully trace the carbon flow from the symbionts to the host, and the photosynthetically acquired carbon lost from the symbiotic association."},{"title":"The effects of muscimol and AMN082 injections into the medial prefrontal cortex on the expression and extinction of conditioned fear in mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1394","abstract":"The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), in particular its infralimbic part, is a key region in mediating the extinction of conditioned fear.

Furthermore, for comparison we injected the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol, which should lead to a temporary inactivation of mPFC. We found impaired between-session extinction of conditioned fear for the muscimol group as well as a decrease in fear expression. However, local injections of AMN082 into the mPFC had no effects.

Males rely in part on color cues to select appropriate mates, and these chromatic cues may be perceived through an opponent interaction between two photoreceptors with maximum wavelength sensitivities at 440 and 508 nm. The range of color discrimination of this dichromatic visual system may be limited, however, and it is unclear whether male blue crabs are capable of discriminating the natural variations in claw color that may be important in mate choice. By testing males’ innate color preferences in binary choice tests between photographs of red-clawed females and six variations of orange-clawed females, we examined both the chromatic (opponent interaction) and achromatic (relative luminance) cues used in male mate choice. Males significantly preferred red-clawed females to orange-clawed females, except when the test colors were similar in both opponency and relative luminance. Our results are unusual in that they indicate that male mate choice in the blue crab is not guided solely by achromatic or chromatic mechanisms, suggesting that both color and intensity are used to evaluate female claw color."},{"title":"Structural characterisation of the N-glycan moiety of the barnacle settlement-inducing protein complex (SIPC)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1192","abstract":"Many barnacle species are gregarious and their cypris larvae display a remarkable ability to explore surfaces before committing to permanent attachment. The chemical cue to gregarious settlement behaviour – the settlement-inducing protein complex (SIPC) – is an α2-macroglobulin-like glycoprotein. This cuticular protein may also be involved in cyprid reversible adhesion if its presence is confirmed in footprints of adhesive deposited during exploratory behaviour, which increase the attractiveness of surfaces and signal other cyprids to settle. The full-length open-reading frame of the SIPC gene encodes a protein of 1547 amino acids with seven potential N-glycosylation sites. In this study on Balanus amphitrite, glycan profiling of the SIPC via hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HILIC-fluorescence) provided evidence of predominantly high mannose glycans (M2–9), with the occurrence of monofucosylated oligomannose glycans (F(6)M2–4) in lower proportions. The high mannose glycosylation found supports previous observations of an interaction with mannose-binding lectins and exogenous mannose increasing settlement in B. amphitrite cypris larvae. Transmission electron microscopy of the deglycosylated SIPC revealed a multi-lobed globular protein with a diameter of ∼8 nm. Obtaining a complete structural characterisation of the SIPC remains a goal that has the potential to inspire solutions to the age-old problem of barnacle fouling."},{"title":"Comparative characterization of Na+ transport in Cyprinodon variegatus variegatus and Cyprinodon variegatus hubbsi: a model species complex for studying teleost invasion of freshwater","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1199","abstract":"The euryhaline fish Cyprinodon variegatus variegatus is capable of tolerating ambient salinities ranging from 0.3 to 160 PSU, but is incapable of long-term survival in freshwater (<2 mmol l–1 Na+). A population isolated in several freshwater (0.4–1 mmol l–1 Na+) lakes in central Florida is now designated as a subspecies (Cyprinodon variegatus hubbsi). We conducted a comparative study of Na+ transport kinetics in these two populations when acclimated to different ambient Na+ concentrations. Results reveal that the two subspecies have qualitatively similar low affinity Na+ uptake kinetics (Km=7000–38,000 μmol l–1) when acclimated to 2 or 7 mmol l–1 Na+, but C. v. hubbsi switches to a high affinity system (Km=100–140 μmol l–1) in low-Na+ freshwater (≤1 mmol l–1 Na+). Inhibitor experiments indicate that Na+ uptake in both subspecies is EIPA-sensitive, but sensitivity decreases with increasing external Na+. EIPA induced a 95% inhibition of Na+ influx in C. v. hubbsi acclimated to 0.1 mmol l–1 Na+, suggesting that this subspecies is utilizing a Na+/H+ exchanger to take up Na+ in low-Na+ environments despite theoretical thermodynamic constraints. Na+ uptake in C. v. hubbsi acclimated to 0.1 mmol l–1 Na+ is phenamil-sensitive but not bafilomycin-sensitive, leading to uncertainty about whether this subspecies also utilizes Na+ channels for Na+ uptake. Experiments with both subspecies acclimated to 7 mmol l–1 Na+ also indicate that a Cl–-dependent Na+ uptake pathway is present. This pathway is not metolazone-sensitive (NCC inhibitor) in either species but is bumetanide-sensitive in C. v. variegatus but not C. v. hubbsi. This suggests that an apical NKCC is increasingly involved with Na+ uptake for this subspecies as external Na+ increases. Finally, characterization of mitochondria-rich cell (MRC) size and density in fish acclimated to different ambient Na+ concentrations revealed significant increases in the number and size of emergent MRCs with decreasing ambient Na+. A linear relationship between the fractional area of emergent MRCs and Na+ uptake rate was observed for both subspecies. However, C. v. variegatus have lower Na+ uptake rates at a given MRC fractional area compared with C. v. hubbsi, indicating that the enhanced Na+ uptake by C. v. hubbsi at low ambient Na+ concentrations is not strictly a result of increased MRC fractional area, and other variables, such as differential expression of proteins involved in Na+ uptake, must provide C. v. hubbsi with the ability to osmoregulate in dilute freshwater."},{"title":"Development of agonistic encounters in dominance hierarchy formation in juvenile crayfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1210","abstract":"We have characterized the behavioural patterns of crayfish during agonistic bouts between groups of crayfish of four different body lengths (9–19, 20–32, 41–48 and 69–75 mm) to characterize changes in the patterns of agonistic encounter during development. The behaviour of both dominant and subordinate animals was analysed by single frame measurement of video recordings. Behavioural acts that occurred during agonistic bouts were categorized as one of seven types: capture, fight, contact, approach, retreat, tailflip and neutral. Dominant–subordinate relationships were formed between juvenile crayfish as early as the third stage of development. Patterns of agonistic bouts to determine social hierarchy became more aggressive during development. The dominant–subordinate relationship was usually determined after contact in crayfish of less than 20 mm and 20–32 mm in length, while several bouts of fights were necessary for crayfish of 41–48 and 69–75 mm in length. Furthermore, social hierarchy was formed more rapidly in small crayfish. In larger animals, the number of approaches by dominant animals that promoted retreat in subordinate animals increased after the establishment of the winner–loser relationship. In smaller crayfish, in contrast, no measurable changes in these behaviour patterns were observed before and after the establishment of the winner–loser relationship. With increasing body size, the probability of tailflips decreased while that of retreats increased as the submissive behavioural act of subordinate animals."},{"title":"CFTR is restricted to a small population of high expresser cells that provide a forskolin-sensitive transepithelial Cl– conductance in the proximal colon of the possum, Trichosurus vulpecula","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1218","abstract":"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is central to anion secretion in both the possum and eutherian small intestine.

Despite considerable CFTR expression, high doses of the CFTR activator forskolin (EC50≈10 μmol l–1) were required for a modest, CFTR-dependent increase in short-circuit current (Isc) in the proximal colon. Presumably, this is because CFTR is restricted to the apical membrane of a small population of CFTR high expresser (CHE) cells in the surface and upper crypt epithelium. Furthermore, although the forskolin-stimulated Isc was dependent on serosal Na+, Cl– and HCO3–, consistent with anion secretion, inhibition of the basolateral Na–K–2Cl– (NKCC1) or Na–HCO3 (pNBCe1) cotransporters did not prevent it. Therefore, although NKCC1 and pNBCe1 are expressed in the colonic epithelium they do not appear to be expressed in CHE cells. At low doses (IC50≈1 μmol l–1), forskolin also decreased the transepithelial conductance (GT) of the colon through inhibition of a 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-stilbenedisulphonic acid-sensitive anion conductance in the basolateral membrane of the CHE cells. This conductance is arranged in series with CFTR in the CHE cells and, therefore, the CHE cells provide a transepithelial Cl– conductance for passive Cl– absorption across the epithelium. Inhibition of the basolateral Cl– conductance of the CHE cells by forskolin will inhibit Na+ absorption by restricting the movement of its counter-ion Cl–, assisting in the conversion of the tissue from an absorptive to a secretory state."},{"title":"Relationship between colouration and body condition in a crab spider that lures pollinators","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1128","abstract":"Sit-and-wait predators have evolved several traits that increase the probability of encountering prey, including lures that attract prey. Although most crab spiders (Thomisidae) are known by their ability to change colour in order to match the background, a few use a different strategy. They are UV-reflective, creating a colour contrast against UV-absorbing flowers that is attractive for pollinators. The nature of the relationship between colour contrast and foraging success is unknown, as is how spiders trade off the potential costs and benefits of strong colour contrast. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between spider colouration, foraging success and background colouration in a crab spider species known to lure pollinators via UV reflectance (Thomisus spectabilis). Field data revealed that spider body condition – a proxy of past foraging success – is positively related to overall colour contrast. We experimentally tested the effect of satiation and background colour on spider colour change. Throughout the experiment, spiders changed their colour contrast regardless of their food intake, suggesting that colour contrast and the UV component contributing to overall contrast are not caused by spider condition. Although spiders responded to different backgrounds by subtly changing their body colour, this did not result in colour matching. We believe that the observed variation in colour contrast and hence conspicuousness in the field, coupled with the spiders’ reaction to our manipulation, could be the result of plasticity in response to prey."},{"title":"Gearing for speed slows the predatory strike of a mantis shrimp","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1231","abstract":"The geometry of an animal’s skeleton governs the transmission of force to its appendages. Joints and rigid elements that create a relatively large output displacement per unit input displacement have been considered to be geared for speed, but the relationship between skeletal geometry and speed is largely untested. The present study explored this subject with experiments and mathematical modeling to evaluate how morphological differences in the raptorial appendage of a mantis shrimp (Gonodactylus smithii) affect the speed of its predatory strike. Based on morphological measurements and material testing, we computationally simulated the transmission of the stored elastic energy that powers a strike and the drag that resists this motion. After verifying the model’s predictions against measurements of strike impulse, we conducted a series of simulations that varied the linkage geometry, but were provided with a fixed amount of stored elastic energy. We found that a skeletal geometry that creates a large output displacement achieves a slower maximum speed of rotation than a low-displacement system. This is because a large displacement by the appendage causes a relatively large proportion of its elastic energy to be lost to the generation of drag. Therefore, the efficiency of transmission from elastic to kinetic energy mediates the relationship between the geometry and the speed of a skeleton. We propose that transmission efficiency plays a similar role in form–function relationships for skeletal systems in a diversity of animals."},{"title":"Non-linear scaling of oxygen consumption and heart rate in a very large cockroach species (Gromphadorhina portentosa): correlated changes with body size and temperature","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1137","abstract":"Although well documented in vertebrates, correlated changes between metabolic rate and cardiovascular function of insects have rarely been described. Using the very large cockroach species Gromphadorhina portentosa, we examined oxygen consumption and heart rate across a range of body sizes and temperatures. Metabolic rate scaled positively and heart rate negatively with body size, but neither scaled linearly. The response of these two variables to temperature was similar. This correlated response to endogenous (body mass) and exogenous (temperature) variables is likely explained by a mutual dependence on similar metabolic substrate use and/or coupled regulatory pathways. The intraspecific scaling for oxygen consumption rate showed an apparent plateauing at body masses greater than about 3 g. An examination of cuticle mass across all instars revealed isometric scaling with no evidence of an ontogenetic shift towards proportionally larger cuticles. Published oxygen consumption rates of other Blattodea species were also examined and, as in our intraspecific examination of G. portentosa, the scaling relationship was found to be non-linear with a decreasing slope at larger body masses. The decreasing slope at very large body masses in both intraspecific and interspecific comparisons may have important implications for future investigations of the relationship between oxygen transport and maximum body size in insects."},{"title":"Corticosterone promotes emergence of fictive air breathing in Xenopus laevis Daudin tadpole brainstems","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1144","abstract":"The emergence of air breathing during amphibian metamorphosis requires significant changes to the brainstem circuits that generate and regulate breathing. However, the mechanisms controlling this developmental process are unknown. Because corticosterone plays an important role in the neuroendocrine regulation of amphibian metamorphosis, we tested the hypothesis that corticosterone augments fictive air breathing frequency in Xenopus laevis. To do so, we compared the fictive air breathing frequency produced by in vitro brainstem preparations from pre-metamorphic tadpoles and adult frogs before and after 1 h application of corticosterone (100 nmol l–1). Fictive breathing measurements related to gill and lung ventilation were recorded extracellularly from cranial nerve rootlets V and X. Corticosterone application had no immediate effect on respiratory-related motor output produced by brainstems from either developmental stage. One hour after corticosterone wash out, fictive lung ventilation frequency was increased whereas gill burst frequency was decreased. This effect was stage specific as it was significant only in preparations from tadpoles. GABA application (0.001–0.5 mmol l–1) augmented fictive air breathing in tadpole preparations. However, this effect of GABA was no longer observed following corticosterone treatment. An increase in circulating corticosterone is one of the endocrine processes that orchestrate central nervous system remodelling during metamorphosis. The age-specific effects of corticosterone application indicate that this hormone can act as an important regulator of respiratory control development in Xenopus tadpoles. Concurrent changes in GABAergic neurotransmission probably contribute to this maturation process, leading to the emergence of air breathing in this species."},{"title":"A buckling region in locust hindlegs contains resilin and absorbs energy when jumping or kicking goes wrong","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1151","abstract":"If a hindleg of a locust slips during jumping, or misses its target during kicking, energy generated by the two extensor tibiae muscles is no longer expended in raising the body or striking a target. How, then, is the energy in a jump (4100–4800 μJ) or kick (1700 μJ) dissipated? A specialised buckling region found in the proximal hind-tibia where the bending moment is high, but not present in the other legs, buckled and allowed the distal part of the tibia to extend. In jumps when a hindleg slipped, it bent by a mean of 23±14 deg at a velocity of 13.4±9.5 deg ms–1; in kicks that failed to contact a target it bent by 32±16 deg at a velocity of 32.9±9.5 deg ms–1. It also buckled 8.5±4.0 deg at a rate of 0.063±0.005 deg ms–1 when the tibia was prevented from flexing fully about the femur in preparation for both these movements. By experimentally buckling this region through 40 deg at velocities of 0.001–0.65 deg ms–1, we showed that one hindleg could store about 870 μJ on bending, of which 210 μJ was dissipated back to the leg on release. A band of blue fluorescence was revealed at the buckling region under UV illumination that had the two key signatures of the elastic protein resilin. A group of campaniform sensilla 300 μm proximal to the buckling region responded to imposed buckling movements. The features of the buckling region show that it can act as a shock absorber as proposed previously when jumping and kicking movements go wrong."},{"title":"Active uptake of artificial particles in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1178","abstract":"Feeding and food choice are crucial to the survival of an animal. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans feeds on various microorganisms in nature, and is usually fed Escherichia coli in the laboratory. To elucidate the mechanisms of food/non-food discrimination in C. elegans, we examined the accumulation of various fluorescent polystyrene microspheres in the absence and presence of bacterial food. In the absence of food and on agar plates, C. elegans worms actively accumulated 0.5 and 1 μm diameter microspheres, whereas those microspheres <0.5 μm or >3 μm were rarely accumulated. Carboxylate microspheres were accumulated more than sulfate or amine microspheres. These results of accumulation in the absence of food probably well simulate uptake of or feeding on the microspheres. Presence of food bacteria even at bacteria:nematode ratios of 1:100 or 1:10 significantly reduced accumulation of 0.5 μm microspheres, and accumulation was reduced to approximately one-fourth of that observed in the absence of bacteria at a ratio of 1:1. When accumulation of microspheres was examined with the chemical sense mutants che-2, tax-2, odr-1 and odr-2, or the feeding mutant eat-1, all the mutants showed less accumulation than the wild type in the absence of food. In the presence of food, the che-2 mutant showed more accumulation than the wild type. It is possible that C. elegans discriminates food both physically, based on size, and chemically, based on taste and olfaction."},{"title":"Expression of SERCA and phospholamban in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) heart: comparison of atrial and ventricular tissue and effects of thermal acclimation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1162","abstract":"In the heart of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), the rate of contraction and Ca2+ uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) are faster in atrial than ventricular muscle, and contraction force relies more on SR Ca2+ stores after acclimation to cold. This study tested the hypothesis that differences in contractile properties and Ca2+ regulation between atrial and ventricular muscle, and between warm-(WA) and cold-acclimated (CA) trout hearts, are associated with differences in expression of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and/or phospholamban (PLN), an inhibitor of the cardiac SERCA. Quantitative PCR (SERCA only) and antibodies raised against SERCA and PLN were used to determine abundances of SERCA2 transcripts and SERCA and PLN proteins, respectively, in atrium and ventricle of trout acclimated to cold (+4°C, CA) and warm (+18°C, WA) temperatures. Expression of SERCA2 transcripts was 1.6 and 2.1 times higher in atrium than ventricle of WA and CA trout, respectively (P<0.05). At the protein level, differences in SERCA expression between atrium and ventricle were 6.1- and 23-fold for WA and CA trout, respectively (P<0.001). Acclimation to cold increased SERCA2 transcripts 2.6- and 2.0-fold in atrial and ventricular muscle, respectively (P<0.05). At the protein level, cold-induced elevation of SERCA (4.6-fold) was noted only in atrial (P<0.05) but not in ventricular tissue (P>0.05). The expression pattern of PLN was similar to that of the SERCA protein, but chamber-specific and temperature-induced differences were much smaller than in the case of SERCA. In the ventricle, PLN/SERCA ratio was 2.1 and 7.0 times higher than in the atrium for WA and CA fish, respectively. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low PLN/SERCA ratio in atrial tissue enables faster SR Ca2+ reuptake and thus contributes to faster kinetics of contraction in comparison with ventricular muscle. Similarly, cold-induced decrease in PLN/SERCA ratio may be associated with faster contraction kinetics of the CA trout heart, in particular in the atrial muscle."},{"title":"Cutaneous water loss and covalently bound lipids of the stratum corneum in nestling house sparrows (Passer domesticus L.) from desert and mesic habitats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1170","abstract":"Lipids of the stratum corneum (SC), the outer layer of the epidermis of birds and mammals, provide a barrier to water vapor diffusion through the skin. The SC of birds consists of flat dead cells, called corneocytes, and two lipid compartments: an intercellular matrix and a monolayer of covalently bound lipids (CBLs) attached to the outer surface of the corneocytes. We previously found two classes of sphingolipids, ceramides and cerebrosides, covalently bound to corneocytes in the SC of house sparrows (Passer domesticus L.); these lipids were associated with cutaneous water loss (CWL). In this study, we collected adult and nestling house sparrows from Ohio and nestlings from Saudi Arabia, acclimated them to either high or low humidity, and measured their rates of CWL. We also measured CWL for natural populations of nestlings from Ohio and Saudi Arabia, beginning when chicks were 2 days old until they fledged. We then evaluated the composition of the CBLs of the SC of sparrows using thin layer chromatography. We found that adult house sparrows had a greater diversity of CBLs in their SC than previously described. During ontogeny, nestling sparrows increased the amount of CBLs and developed their CBLs differently, depending on their habitat. Acclimating nestlings to different humidity regimes did not alter the ontogeny of the CBLs, suggesting that these lipids represent a fundamental component of SC organization that does not respond to short-term environmental change."},{"title":"Silk secretion from tarantula feet revisited: alleged spigots are probably chemoreceptors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1084","abstract":"Controversial views have been expressed about whether tarantula feet can secrete fine silk threads that could prevent them from falling off smooth vertical surfaces. Two studies have claimed that ‘ribbed hairs’ on the tarsi of tarantulas produce silk. We examined these ribbed hairs in several tarantula species using light and scanning electron microscopy, and compared them with the silk-producing spigots on the abdominal spinnerets. We found that, morphologically, these ribbed hairs correspond very closely to known chemosensitive hairs in spiders; they have a distinct socket, a bent hair shaft with fine cuticular ridges, an eccentric double lumen within the hair shaft, and a blunt tip with a subterminal pore. Spigots on the spinnerets have a large bulbous base instead of a socket, a long shaft with a scaly surface and a central terminal pore. We never observed any silk threads coming out of these ribbed hairs under the electron microscope. By contrast, silk threads exiting the spigots on the spinnerets were common. Interestingly, ribbed hairs also occur on the spinnerets, often side by side with the silk-producing spigots. Our conclusion is that the ribbed hairs are chemoreceptors, not spigots. Observations of live tarantulas clinging inverted to glass coverslips confirmed that some substance is produced by the ribbed hairs, but it remains unclear whether this secretion is actually silk. In any case, the thousands of adhesive setae on the tarsi of legs and pedipalps almost certainly far outweigh any potential contribution from the sparsely distributed trails secreted by the ribbed hairs."},{"title":"Octopamine improves learning in newly emerged bees but not in old foragers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1076","abstract":"Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are well known for their excellent learning abilities. Although most age groups learn quickly to associate an odor with a sucrose reward, newly emerged bees and old foragers often perform poorly. For a long time, the reason for the poor learning performance of these age groups was unclear. We show that reduced sensitivity for sucrose is the cause for poor associative learning in newly emerged bees but not in old foragers. By increasing the sensitivity for sucrose through octopamine, we selectively improved the learning performance of insensitive newly emerged bees. Interestingly, the learning performance of foragers experiencing the same treatment remained low, despite the observed increase in sensitivity for the reward. We thus demonstrate that increasing sensitivity for the reward can improve the associative learning performance of bees when they are young but not when they had foraged for a long time. Importantly, octopamine can have very different effects on bees, depending on their initial sensory sensitivity. These differential effects of octopamine have important consequences for interpreting the action of biogenic amines on insect behavior."},{"title":"Allocation of endogenous and dietary protein in the reconstitution of the gastrointestinal tract in migratory blackcaps at stopover sites","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1069","abstract":"During migratory flight, the mass of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and its associated organs in small birds decreases in size by as much as 40%, compared with the preflight condition because of the catabolism of protein. At stopover sites, birds need 2–3 days to rebuild their GIT so that they can restore body mass and fat reserves to continue migration. The source of protein used to rebuild the GIT may be exogenous (from food ingested) or endogenous (reallocated from other organs) or both. Because the relative contribution of these sources to rebuild the GIT of migratory birds is not yet known, we mimicked in-flight fasting and then re-feeding in two groups of blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla), a Palearctic migratory passerine. The birds were fed a diet containing either 3% or 20% protein to simulate different refueling scenarios. During re-feeding, birds received known doses of 15N-l-leucine before we measured the isotope concentrations in GIT and associated digestive organs and in locomotory muscles. We then quantified the extent to which blackcaps rebuilt their GIT with endogenous and/or dietary protein while refeeding after a fast. Our results indicate that blackcaps fed the low-protein diet incorporated less exogenous nitrogen into their tissues than birds fed the 20% protein diet. They also allocated relatively more exogenous protein to the GIT than to pectoral muscle than those birds re-fed with the high-protein diet. However, this compensation was not sufficient for birds eating the low-protein diet to rebuild their intestine at the same rate as the birds re-fed the high-protein diet. We concluded that blackcaps must choose stopover sites at which they can maximize protein intake to minimize the time it takes to rebuild their GIT and, thus, resume migration as soon as possible."},{"title":"Adaptation strategies to seasonal changes in environmental conditions of a domesticated horse breed, the Shetland pony (Equus ferus caballus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1061","abstract":"Recent results suggest that the wild ancestor of the horse, the Przewalski horse, exhibits signs of a hypometabolism. However, there are speculations that domestic animals lost the ability to reduce energy expenditure during food shortage and adverse environmental conditions. Therefore, we investigated physiological and behavioural strategies employed by a robust domesticated horse breed, the Shetland pony, over the course of a year under temperate conditions by measuring ambient temperature (Ta), subcutaneous temperature (Ts), locomotor activity (LA), lying time, resting heart rate, body mass and body condition score. Ten animals were kept on pasture in summer and in open stables in winter; further, in winter the animals were allocated into one control and one feed-restricted group of five animals each to simulate natural seasonal food shortage. The annual course of the mean daily Ts of all horses showed distinct fluctuations from a mean of 35.6±0.5°C, with higher variations in summer than in winter. Diurnal amplitudes in Ts were highest (P<0.001) in April (12.6°C) and lowest in January (4.0°C), with a nadir around dawn and a peak around mid-day. The feed-restricted group had a significantly lower daily Ts compared with the control group on cold winter days, with Ta values below 0°C. Mean annual heart rate and LA followed Ta closely. Heart rate of the feed-restricted animals significantly decreased from a mean of 52.8±8.1 beats min–1 in summer to 29±3.9 beats min–1 in winter and differed from the control group (P<0.001). Mean daily LA was lowest at the end of winter (7000 activity impulses day–1) and highest in summer (25,000 activity impulses day–1). Our results show that Shetland ponies exhibit signs of a winter hypometabolism indicated by reduced heart rate and Ts. Thus, domesticated horses seem to have maintained the capacity for seasonal adaptation to environmental conditions by seasonal fluctuations in their metabolic rate."},{"title":"Limited variation in visual sensitivity among bowerbird species suggests that there is no link between spectral tuning and variation in display colouration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1090","abstract":"Variation in visual spectral tuning has evolved in concert with signal colour in some taxa, but there is limited evidence of this pattern in birds. To further investigate this possibility, we compared spectral sensitivity among bowerbird species that occupy different visual habitats and are highly diverged in plumage and decoration colour displays, which are important in mate choice and possibly reproductive isolation. Microspectrophotometry of violet-, short-, medium- and long-wavelength-sensitive cones revealed no significant interspecific variation in visual pigment peak spectral absorbance values that ranged between 404–410, 454, 503–511 and 558–568 nm, respectively. Mean cut-off wavelength values for C-, Y-, R- and P-type coloured oil droplets were 418–441, 508–523, 558–573 and 412–503 nm, respectively, with values at longer wavelengths in ventral compared with dorsal retina cones. Low ocular media mid-wavelength transmission values (340–352 nm) suggest that bowerbirds may represent a transitional stage in the evolution from the ancestral violet-sensitive- to the derived ultraviolet-sensitive-type short-wavelength-sensitive-1-based visual system found in younger passerine lineages. Sequence data obtained for rod opsin and four cone opsin genes were identical at key tuning sites, except for an interspecific leucine-52-alanine polymorphism in the short-wavelength-sensitive 2 opsin. There was no obvious relationship between relative proportions of cone classes and either visual habitat or display colour. Overall, we detected little interspecific variation in bowerbird spectral sensitivity and no association between sensitivity and display diversity, which is consistent with the general trend among avian taxa."},{"title":"Proteomic responses of blue mussel (Mytilus) congeners to temperature acclimation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1106","abstract":"The ability to acclimate to variable environmental conditions affects the biogeographic range of species, their success at colonizing new habitats, and their likelihood of surviving rapid anthropogenic climate change. Here we compared responses to temperature acclimation (4 weeks at 7, 13 and 19°C) in gill tissue of the warm-adapted intertidal blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, an invasive species in the northeastern Pacific, and the cold-adapted M. trossulus, the native congener in the region, to better understand the physiological differences underlying the ongoing competition. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that warm acclimation caused changes in cytoskeletal composition and proteins of energy metabolism in both species, consistent with increasing rates of filtration and respiration due to increased ciliary activity. During cold acclimation, changes in cytoskeletal proteins were accompanied by increasing abundances of oxidative stress proteins and molecular chaperones, possibly because of the increased production of aldehydes as indicated by the upregulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase. The cold-adapted M. trossulus showed increased abundances of molecular chaperones at 19°C, but M. galloprovincialis did not, suggesting that the two species differ in their long-term upper thermal limits. In contrast, the warm-adapted M. galloprovincialis showed a stronger response to cold acclimation than M. trossulus, including changes in abundance in more proteins and differing protein expression profiles between 7 and 13°C, a pattern absent in M. trossulus. In general, increasing levels of oxidative stress proteins inversely correlate with modifications in Krebs cycle and electron transport chain proteins, indicating a trade-off between oxidative stress resistance and energy production. Overall, our results help explain why M. galloprovincialis has replaced M. trossulus in southern California over the last century, but also suggest that M. trossulus may maintain a competitive advantage at colder temperatures. Anthropogenic global warming may reinforce the advantage M. galloprovincialis has over M. trossulus in the warmer parts of the latter’s historical range."},{"title":"Mechanisms underlying parallel reductions in aerobic capacity in non-migratory threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) populations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/746","abstract":"Non-migratory, stream-resident populations of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, have a lower maximum oxygen consumption (ṀO2,max) than ancestral migratory marine populations. Here, we examined laboratory-bred stream-resident and marine crosses from two locations (West and Bonsall Creeks) to determine which steps in the oxygen transport and utilization cascade evolved in conjunction with, and thus have the potential to contribute to, these differences in ṀO2,max. We found that West Creek stream-resident fish have larger muscle fibres (not measured in Bonsall fish), Bonsall Creek stream-resident fish have smaller ventricles, and both stream-resident populations have evolved smaller pectoral adductor and abductor muscles. However, many steps of the oxygen cascade did not evolve in stream-resident populations (gill surface area, hematocrit, mean cellular hemoglobin content and the activities of mitochondrial enzymes per gram ventricle and pectoral muscle), arguing against symmorphosis. We also studied F1 hybrids to determine which traits in the oxygen cascade have a genetic architecture similar to that of ṀO2,max. In West Creek, ṀO2,max, abductor and adductor size all showed dominance of marine alleles, whereas in Bonsall Creek, ṀO2,max and ventricle mass showed dominance of stream-resident alleles. We also found genetically based differences among marine populations in hematocrit, ventricle mass, pectoral muscle mass and pectoral muscle pyruvate kinase activity. Overall, reductions in pectoral muscle mass evolved in conjunction with reductions in ṀO2,max in both stream-resident populations, but the specific steps in the oxygen cascade that have a genetic basis similar to that of ṀO2,max, and are thus predicted to have the largest impact on ṀO2,max, differ among populations."},{"title":"Effects of night-time warming on temperate ectotherm reproduction: potential fitness benefits of climate change for side-blotched lizards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/7/1117","abstract":"Temperate ectotherms, especially those at higher latitudes, are expected to benefit from climate warming, but few data yet exist to verify this prediction. Furthermore, most previous studies on the effects of climate change utilized a model of uniform annual change, which assumes that temperature increases are symmetric on diurnal or seasonal time scales. In this study, we simulated observed trends in the asymmetric alteration of diurnal temperature range by increasing night-time temperatures experienced by female lizards during their ovarian cycle as well as by the resulting eggs during their incubation. We found that higher night-time temperatures during the ovarian cycle increased the probability of reproductive success and decreased the duration of the reproductive cycle, but did not affect embryo stage or size at oviposition, clutch size, egg mass or relative clutch mass. Furthermore, higher incubation temperatures increased hatchling size and decreased incubation period but had no effect on incubation success. Subsequent hatchlings were more likely to survive winter if they hatched earlier, though our sample size of hatchlings was relatively small. These findings indicate that higher night-time temperatures mainly affect rate processes and that certain aspects of life history are less directly temperature dependent. As our findings confirm that climate warming is likely to increase the rate of development as well as advance reproductive phenology, we predict that warmer nights during the breeding season will increase reproductive output as well as subsequent survival in many temperate ectotherms, both of which should have positive fitness effects."},{"title":"Geometry of compensatory feeding and water consumption in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/766","abstract":"Feeding behaviour is an expression of an animal’s underlying nutritional strategy. The study of feeding decisions can hence delineate nutritional strategies. Studies of Drosophila melanogaster feeding behaviour have yielded conflicting accounts, and little is known about how nutrients affect feeding patterns in this important model species. Here, we conducted two experiments to characterize nutrient prioritization and regulation. In a choice experiment, we allowed female flies to self-regulate their intake of yeast, sucrose and water by supplying individual flies with three microcapillary tubes: one containing only yeast of varying concentrations, another with just sucrose of varying concentrations, and the last with just water. Flies tightly regulated yeast and sucrose to a constant ratio at the expense of excess water intake, indicating that flies prioritize macronutrient regulation over excess water consumption. To determine the relative importance of yeast and sucrose, in a no-choice experiment, we provided flies with two microcapillary tubes: the first with one of the 28 diets varying in yeast and sucrose content and the other with only water. Flies increased total water intake in relation to yeast consumption but not sucrose consumption. Additionally, flies increased diet intake as diet concentration decreased and as the ratio of sugar to yeast equalized. Using a geometric scaling approach, we found that the patterns of diet intake can be explained by flies prioritizing protein and carbohydrates equally and by the lack of substitutability between the nutrients. We conclude by illustrating how our results harmonize conflicting results in the literature once viewed in a two-dimensional diet landscape."},{"title":"Aging modulates cuticular hydrocarbons and sexual attractiveness in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/814","abstract":"Attractiveness is a major component of sexual selection that is dependent on sexual characteristics, such as pheromone production, which often reflect an individual’s fitness and reproductive potential. Aging is a process that results in a steady decline in survival and reproductive output, yet little is known about its effect on specific aspects of attractiveness. In this report we asked how aging impacts pheromone production and sexual attractiveness in Drosophila melanogaster. Evidence suggests that key pheromones in Drosophila are produced as cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC), whose functions in attracting mates and influencing behavior have been widely studied. We employed gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to show that the composition of D. melanogaster CHC is significantly affected by aging in both sexes and that these changes are robust to different genetic backgrounds. Aging affected the relative levels of many individual CHC, and it shifted overall hydrocarbon profiles to favor compounds with longer chain lengths. We also show that the observed aging-related changes in CHC profiles are responsible for a significant reduction in sexual attractiveness. These studies illuminate causal links among pheromones, aging and attractiveness and suggest that CHC production may be an honest indicator of animal health and fertility."},{"title":"Is solid always best?

The skull, in particular, has been the focus of previous studies because it is driven into the substrate for burrowing. There are two different types of skulls in caecilians: (1) stegokrotaphic, where the squamosal completely covers the temporal region and the jaw closing muscles, and (2) zygokrotaphic, with incomplete coverage of the temporal region by the squamosal. We used 3-D imaging and modeling techniques to explore the functional consequences of these skull types in an evolutionary context. We digitally converted stegokrotaphic skulls into zygokrotaphic skulls and vice versa. We also generated a third, akinetic skull type that was presumably present in extinct caecilian ancestors. We explored the benefits and costs of the different skull types under frontal loading at different head angles with finite element analysis (FEA). Surprisingly, the differences in stress distributions and bending between the three tested skull types were minimal and not significant. This suggests that the open temporal region in zygokrotaphic skulls does not lead to poorer performance during burrowing. However, the results of the FEA suggest a strong relationship between the head angle and skull performance, implying there is an optimal head angle during burrowing."},{"title":"Copper and zinc detoxification in Gammarus pulex (L.)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/822","abstract":"To negate the toxicity of labile intracellular metals, some aquatic organisms partition metals into specific subcellular locations for detoxification, namely the soluble heat-stable cytosol and insoluble metal-rich granules.

In the cytosol of gammarids exposed at Relubbus, copper and zinc associated to a 7.5-kDa metallothionein-like protein (MTLP) that was largely absent from gammarids prior to exposure. Exposure at Relubbus caused MTLP concentrations to increase 4- to 5-fold between days 2 and 4, indicating an induction response to increased labile intracellular metal. On day 16, spherical calcium-rich granules (0.5–2.5 μmol l–1) were visualised and analysed in the posterior caeca of gammarids exposed at both sites. Following exposure at Relubbus, granules contained trace amounts of copper, but zinc was absent. Granules in gammarids exposed at Drym contained no detectable copper or zinc. Granule formation appeared to be independent of exposure. Within the posterior caeca, granules have been associated with calcium storage during the crustacean molt, rather than in detoxification of trace metals. However, the granular copper burden appeared to follow environmental Cu availabilities. Thus, we describe Cu sequestration within molt-cycle calcium storage granules. As both MTLP concentrations and granule formation in crustaceans are affected upon by molting, we hypothesise that detoxification might impact upon this existing process."},{"title":"The accessory role of the diaphragmaticus muscle in lung ventilation in the estuarine crocodile Crocodylus porosus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/845","abstract":"Crocodilians use a combination of three muscular mechanisms to effect lung ventilation: the intercostal muscles producing thoracic movement, the abdominal muscles producing pelvic rotation and gastralial translation, and the diaphragmaticus muscle producing visceral displacement. Earlier studies suggested that the diaphragmaticus is a primary muscle of inspiration in crocodilians, but direct measurements of the diaphragmatic contribution to lung ventilation and gas exchange have not been made to date. In this study, ventilation, metabolic rate and arterial blood gases were measured from juvenile estuarine crocodiles under three conditions: (i) while resting at 30°C and 20°C; (ii) while breathing hypercapnic gases; and (iii) during immediate recovery from treadmill exercise. The relative contribution of the diaphragmaticus was then determined by obtaining measurements before and after transection of the muscle. The diaphragmaticus was found to make only a limited contribution to lung ventilation while crocodiles were resting at 30°C and 20°C, and during increased respiratory drive induced by hypercapnic gas. However, the diaphragmaticus muscle was found to play a significant role in facilitating a higher rate of inspiratory airflow in response to exercise. Transection of the diaphragmaticus decreased the exercise-induced increase in the rate of inspiration (with no compensatory increases in the duration of inspiration), thus compromising the exercise-induced increases in tidal volume and minute ventilation. These results suggest that, in C. porosus, costal ventilation alone is able to support metabolic demands at rest, and the diaphragmaticus is largely an accessory muscle used at times of elevated metabolic demand."},{"title":"Dietary protein quality differentially regulates trypsin enzymes at the secretion and transcription level in Panulirus argus by distinct signaling pathways","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/853","abstract":"The effects of pelleted diets with different protein composition (fish, squid or soybean meals as main protein sources) on trypsin secretion and expression were studied in the lobster Panulirus argus. Trypsin secretion was shown to be maximal 4 h after ingestion. At this time, fish- and squid-based diets induced trypsin secretion, as well as up-regulation of the major trypsin isoform at the transcription level. While fish- and squid-based diets elicited a prandial response, soybean-based diet failed to stimulate the digestive gland to secrete trypsin into the gastric fluid or induce trypsin expression above the levels observed in fasting lobsters. In vitro assays showed that intact proteins rather than protein hydrolysates stimulate trypsin secretion in the lobster. However, the signal for trypsin transcription appears to be different to that for secretion and is probably mediated by the appearance of free amino acids in the digestive gland, suggesting a stepwise regulation of trypsin enzymes during digestion. We conclude that trypsin enzymes in P. argus are regulated at the transcription and secretion level by the quality of dietary proteins through two distinct signaling pathways. Our results indicate that protein digestion efficiency in spiny lobsters can be improved by selecting appropriated protein sources. However, other factors like the poor solubility of dietary proteins in dry diets could hamper further enhancement of digestion efficiency."},{"title":"Scaling of wingbeat frequency with body mass in bats and limits to maximum bat size","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/711","abstract":"The ability to fly opens up ecological opportunities but flight mechanics and muscle energetics impose constraints, one of which is that the maximum body size must be kept below a rather low limit. The muscle power available for flight increases in proportion to flight muscle mass and wingbeat frequency. The maximum wingbeat frequency attainable among increasingly large animals decreases faster than the minimum frequency required, so eventually they coincide, thereby defining the maximum body mass at which the available power just matches up to the power required for sustained aerobic flight. Here, we report new wingbeat frequency data for 27 morphologically diverse bat species representing nine families, and additional data from the literature for another 38 species, together spanning a range from 2.0 to 870 g. For these species, wingbeat frequency decreases with increasing body mass as Mb–0.26. We filmed 25 of our 27 species in free flight outdoors, and for these the wingbeat frequency varies as Mb–0.30. These exponents are strikingly similar to the body mass dependency Mb–0.27 among birds, but the wingbeat frequency is higher in birds than in bats for any given body mass. The downstroke muscle mass is also a larger proportion of the body mass in birds. We applied these empirically based scaling functions for wingbeat frequency in bats to biomechanical theories about how the power required for flight and the power available converge as animal size increases. To this end we estimated the muscle mass-specific power required for the largest flying extant bird (12–16 kg) and assumed that the largest potential bat would exert similar muscle mass-specific power. Given the observed scaling of wingbeat frequency and the proportion of the body mass that is made up by flight muscles in birds and bats, we estimated the maximum potential body mass for bats to be 1.1–2.3 kg. The largest bats, extinct or extant, weigh 1.6 kg. This is within the range expected if it is the bat characteristic flight muscle mass and wingbeat frequency that limit the maximum body mass in bats. It is only a tenth the mass of the largest flying extant bird."},{"title":"How to make a sexy snake: estrogen activation of female sex pheromone in male red-sided garter snakes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/723","abstract":"Vertebrates indicate their genetic sex to conspecifics using secondary sexual signals, and signal expression is often activated by sex hormones. Among vertebrate signaling modalities, the least is known about how hormones influence chemical signaling. Our study species, the red-sided garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis), is a model vertebrate for studying hormonal control of chemical signals because males completely rely on the female sex pheromone to identify potential mates among thousands of individuals. How sex hormones can influence the expression of this crucial sexual signal is largely unknown. We created two groups of experimental males for the first experiment: Sham (blank implants) and E2 (17β-estradiol implants). E2 males were vigorously courted by wild males in outdoor bioassays, and in a Y-maze E2 pheromone trails were chosen by wild males over those of small females and were indistinguishable from large female trails. Biochemically, the E2 pheromone blend was similar to that of large females, and it differed significantly from Shams. For the second experiment, we implanted males with 17β-estradiol in 2007 but removed the implants the following year (2008; Removal). That same year, we implanted a new group of males with estrogen implants (Implant). Removal males were courted by wild males in 2008 (implant intact) but not in 2009 (removed). Total pheromone quantity and quality increased following estrogen treatment, and estrogen removal re-established male-typical pheromone blends. Thus, we have shown that estrogen activates the production of female pheromone in adult red-sided garter snakes. This is the first known study to quantify both behavioral and biochemical responses in chemical signaling following sex steroid treatment of reptiles in the activation/organization context. We propose that the homogametic sex (ZZ, male) may possess the same targets for activation of sexual signal production, and the absence of the activator (17β-estradiol in this case) underlies expression of the male phenotype."},{"title":"Alteration of mitochondrial efficiency affects oxidative balance, development and growth in frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/863","abstract":"Mitochondria are known to play a central role in life history processes, being the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promote oxidative constraint. Surprisingly, although the main role of the mitochondria is to produce ATP, the plasticity of mitochondrial ATP generation has received little attention in life history studies. Yet, mitochondrial energy transduction represents the physiological link between environmental resources and energy allocated to animal performance. Studying both facets of mitochondrial functioning (ATP and ROS production) would allow better understanding of the proximate mechanisms underlying life history. We have experimentally modulated the mitochondrial capacity to generate ROS and ATP during larval development of Rana temporaria tadpoles, via chronic exposure (34 days) to a mitochondrial uncoupler (2,4-dinitrophenol, dNP). The aim was to better understand the impact of mitochondrial uncoupling on both responses in terms of oxidative balance, energy input (oxygen and feeding consumption) and energy output (growth and development of the tadpole). Exposure to 2,4-dNP reduced mitochondrial ROS generation, total antioxidant defences and oxidative damage in treated tadpoles compared with controls. Despite the beneficial effect of dNP on oxidative status, development and growth rates of treated tadpoles were lower than those in the control group. Treatment of tadpoles with 2,4-dNP promoted a mild mitochondrial uncoupling and enhanced metabolic rate. These tadpoles did not increase their food consumption, and thus failed to compensate for the energy loss elicited by the decrease in the efficiency of ATP production. These data suggest that the cost of ATP production, rather than the oxidative balance, is the parameter that constrains growth/development of tadpoles, highlighting the central role of energy transduction in larval performance."},{"title":"Net superoxide levels: steeper increase with activity in cooler female and hotter male lizards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/731","abstract":"Ectotherms increase their body temperature in response to ambient heat, thereby elevating their metabolic rate. An often inferred consequence of this is an overall upregulation of gene expression and energetic expenditure, and a concomitant increased production of reactive oxygen species (e.g. superoxide) and, perhaps, a shortened lifespan. However, recent work shows that this may be a superficial interpretation. For example, sometimes a reduced temperature may in fact trigger up-regulation of gene expression. We studied temperature and associated activity effects in male and female Australian painted dragon lizards (Ctenophorus pictus) by allowing the lizards to bask for 4 h versus 12 h, and scoring their associated activity (inactive versus active basking and foraging). As predicted, long-basking lizards (hereafter ‘hot’) showed heightened activity in both sexes, with a more pronounced effect in females. We then tested for sex-specific effects of basking treatment and activity levels on the increase in net levels of superoxide. In males, short-baskers (hereafter ‘cold’) had significantly more rapidly decreasing levels of superoxide per unit increasing activity than hot males. In females, however, superoxide levels increased faster with increasing activity in the cold than in the hot basking treatment, and females earlier in the ovarian cycle had lower superoxide levels than females closer to ovulation. In short, males and females differ in how their levels of reactive oxygen species change with temperature-triggered activity."},{"title":"Stable isotope tracer reveals that viviparous snakes transport amino acids to offspring during gestation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/760","abstract":"Viviparity and placentation have evolved from oviparity over 100 times in squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes). The independent origins of placentation have resulted in a variety of placental morphologies in different taxa, ranging from simple apposition of fetal and maternal tissues to endotheliochorial implantation that is homoplasious with mammalian placentation. Because the eggs of oviparous squamates transport gases and water from the environment and calcium from the eggshell, the placentae of viviparous squamates are thought to have initially evolved to accomplish these functions from within the maternal oviduct. Species with complex placentae have also been shown to rely substantially, or even primarily, on placental transport of organic nutrients for embryonic nutrition. However, it is unclear whether species with only simple placentae are also capable of transporting organic nutrients to offspring. Among viviparous squamates, all of the snakes that have been studied thus far have been shown to have simple placentae. However, most studies of snake placentation are limited to a single lineage, the North American Natricinae. We tested the abilities of four species of viviparous snakes – Agkistrodon contortrix (Viperidae), Boa constrictor (Boidae), Nerodia sipedon (Colubridae: Natricinae) and Thamnophis sirtalis (Colubridae: Natricinae) – to transport diet-derived amino acids to offspring during gestation. We fed [15N]leucine to pregnant snakes, and compared offspring 15N content with that of unlabeled controls. Labeled females allocated significantly more 15N to offspring than did controls, but 15N allocation did not differ among species. Our results indicate that viviparous snakes are capable of transporting diet-derived amino acids to their offspring during gestation, possibly via placentation."},{"title":"Polarotactic tabanids find striped patterns with brightness and/or polarization modulation least attractive: an advantage of zebra stripes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/736","abstract":"The characteristic striped appearance of zebras has provoked much speculation about its function and why the pattern has evolved, but experimental evidence is scarce. Here, we demonstrate that a zebra-striped horse model attracts far fewer horseflies (tabanids) than either homogeneous black, brown, grey or white equivalents. Such biting flies are prevalent across Africa and have considerable fitness impact on potential mammalian hosts. Besides brightness, one of the likely mechanisms underlying this protection is the polarization of reflected light from the host animal. We show that the attractiveness of striped patterns to tabanids is also reduced if only polarization modulations (parallel stripes with alternating orthogonal directions of polarization) occur in horizontal or vertical homogeneous grey surfaces. Tabanids have been shown to respond strongly to linearly polarized light, and we demonstrate here that the light and dark stripes of a zebra’s coat reflect very different polarizations of light in a way that disrupts the attractiveness to tabanids. We show that the attractiveness to tabanids decreases with decreasing stripe width, and that stripes below a certain size are effective in not attracting tabanids. Further, we demonstrate that the stripe widths of zebra coats fall in a range where the striped pattern is most disruptive to tabanids. The striped coat patterns of several other large mammals may also function in reducing exposure to tabanids by similar mechanisms of differential brightness and polarization of reflected light. This work provides an experimentally supported explanation for the underlying mechanism leading to the selective advantage of a black-and-white striped coat pattern."},{"title":"The hydrodynamic function of shark skin and two biomimetic applications","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/785","abstract":"It has long been suspected that the denticles on shark skin reduce hydrodynamic drag during locomotion, and a number of man-made materials have been produced that purport to use shark-skin-like surface roughness to reduce drag during swimming. But no studies to date have tested these claims of drag reduction under dynamic and controlled conditions in which the swimming speed and hydrodynamics of shark skin and skin-like materials can be quantitatively compared with those of controls lacking surface ornamentation or with surfaces in different orientations. We use a flapping foil robotic device that allows accurate determination of the self-propelled swimming (SPS) speed of both rigid and flexible membrane-like foils made of shark skin and two biomimetic models of shark skin to measure locomotor performance. We studied the SPS speed of real shark skin, a silicone riblet material with evenly spaced ridges and a Speedo® ‘shark skin-like’ swimsuit fabric attached to rigid flat-plate foils and when made into flexible membrane-like foils. We found no consistent increase in swimming speed with Speedo® fabric, a 7.2% increase with riblet material, whereas shark skin membranes (but not rigid shark skin plates) showed a mean 12.3% increase in swimming speed compared with the same skin foils after removing the denticles. Deformation of the shark skin membrane is thus crucial to the drag-reducing effect of surface denticles. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) of the flow field surrounding moving shark skin foils shows that skin denticles promote enhanced leading-edge suction, which might have contributed to the observed increase in swimming speed. Shark skin denticles might thus enhance thrust, as well as reduce drag."},{"title":"Papiliochrome II pigment reduces the angle dependency of structural wing colouration in nireus group papilionids","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/796","abstract":"The wings of four papilionid butterfly species of the nireus group, Papilio bromius, P. epiphorbas, P. nireus and P. oribazus, are marked by blue-green coloured bands surrounded by black margins. The cover scales in the coloured bands contain a violet-absorbing, blue-fluorescing pigment. The fluorescence and absorbance spectra of the nireus group wings are very similar to those of the wings of the Japanese yellow swallowtail, Papilio xuthus, and thus the pigment is presumably papiliochrome II. The scale structures of P. xuthus are arranged irregularly, and both the fluorescence and light reflection are diffuse. In the nireus papilionids, the spatial fluorescence distribution of the scales is also diffuse, but the reflection is specular. The scales have a multilayered structure, consisting of two main laminae. We show that the papiliochrome II pigment in the upper lamina of the scales functions as a violet-blocking long-pass filter in front of the lower lamina, thus limiting the reflectance spectrum to the blue-green wavelength range. Optical modelling showed that the papiliochrome II filter effectively removes the angle dependency of the reflectance spectra – that is, it reduces the wing iridescence. The contribution of the fluorescence signal to the visual appearance is minor."},{"title":"In the face of hypoxia: myoglobin increases in response to hypoxic conditions and lipid supplementation in cultured Weddell seal skeletal muscle cells","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/806","abstract":"A key cellular adaptation to diving in Weddell seals is enhanced myoglobin concentrations in their skeletal muscles, which serve to store oxygen to sustain a lipid-based aerobic metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine whether seal muscle cells are inherently adapted to possess the unique skeletal muscle adaptations to diving seen in the whole animal. We hypothesized that the seal skeletal muscle cells would have enhanced concentrations of myoglobin de novo that would be greater than those from a C2C12 skeletal muscle cell line and reflect the concentrations of myoglobin observed in previous studies. In addition we hypothesized that the seal cells would respond to environmental hypoxia similarly to the C2C12 cells in that citrate synthase activity and myoglobin would remain the same or decrease under hypoxia and lactate dehydrogenase activity would increase under hypoxia as previously reported. We further hypothesized that β-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase activity would increase in response to the increasing amounts of lipid supplemented to the culture medium. Our results show that myoglobin significantly increases in response to environmental hypoxia and lipids in the Weddell seal cells, while appearing similar metabolically to the C2C12 cells. The results of this study suggest the regulation of myoglobin expression is fundamentally different in Weddell seal skeletal muscle cells when compared with a terrestrial mammalian cell line in that hypoxia and lipids initially prime the skeletal muscles for enhanced myoglobin expression. However, the cells need a secondary stimulus to further increase myoglobin to levels seen in the whole animal."},{"title":"Effects of different substrates on the sprint performance of lizards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/774","abstract":"The variation in substrate structure is one of the most important determinants of the locomotor abilities of lizards. Lizards are found across a range of habitats, from large rocks to loose sand, each of them with conflicting mechanical demands on locomotion. We examined the relationships among sprint speed, morphology and different types of substrate surfaces in species of lizards that exploit different structural habitats (arboreal, saxicolous, terrestrial and arenicolous) in a phylogenetic context. Our main goals were to assess which processes drive variability in morphology (i.e. phylogeny or adaptation to habitat) in order to understand how substrate structure affects sprint speed in species occupying different habitats and to determine the relationship between morphology and performance. Liolaemini lizards show that most morphological traits are constrained by phylogeny, particularly toe 3, the femur and foot. All ecological groups showed significant differences on rocky surfaces. Surprisingly, no ecological group performed better on the surface resembling its own habitat. Moreover, all groups exhibited significant differences in sprint speed among the three different types of experimental substrates and showed the best performance on sand, with the exception of the arboreal group. Despite the fact that species use different types of habitats, the highly conservative morphology of Liolaemini species and the similar levels of performance on different types of substrates suggest that they confer to the ‘jack of all trades and master of none’ principle."},{"title":"Characterisation of chemosensory trigeminal receptors in the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss: responses to chemical irritants and carbon dioxide","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/685","abstract":"Trigeminally innervated, mechanically sensitive chemoreceptors (M) were previously identified in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, but it is not known whether these receptors are responsive only to noxious, chemical irritants or have a general chemosensory function. This study aimed to characterise the stimulus–response properties of these receptors in comparison with polymodal nociceptors (P). Both P and M gave similar response profiles to acetic acid concentrations. The electrophysiological properties were similar between the two different afferent types. To determine whether the receptors have a nociceptive function, a range of chemical stimulants was applied to these receptors, including non-noxious stimuli such as ammonium chloride, bile, sodium bicarbonate and alarm pheromone, and potentially noxious chemical irritants such as acetic acid, carbon dioxide, low pH, citric acid, citric acid phosphate buffer and sodium chloride. Only irritant stimuli evoked a response, confirming their nociceptive function. All receptor afferents tested responded to carbon dioxide (CO2) in the form of mineral water or soda water. The majority responded to 1% acetic acid, 2% citric acid, citric acid phosphate buffer (pH 3) and 5.0 mol l–1 NaCl. CO2 receptors have been characterised in the orobranchial cavity and gill arches in fish; however, this is the first time that external CO2 receptors have been identified on the head of a fish. Because the fish skin is in constant contact with the aqueous environment, contaminants with a low pH or hypercapnia may stimulate the nociceptive system in fish."},{"title":"Effect of particulate contamination on adhesive ability and repellence in two species of ant (Hymenoptera; Formicidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/605","abstract":"Tarsal adhesive pads are crucial for the ability of insects to traverse their natural environment. Previous studies have demonstrated that for both hairy and smooth adhesive pads, significant reduction in adhesion can occur because of contamination of these pads by wax crystals present on plant surfaces or synthetic microspheres. In this paper, we focus on the smooth adhesive pads of ants and study systematically how particulate contamination and the subsequent loss of adhesion depends on particle size, particle surface energy, humidity and species size. To this end, workers of ant species Polyrhachis dives and Myrmica scabrinodis (Hymenoptera; Formicidae) were presented with loose synthetic powder barriers with a range of powder diameters (1–500 μm) and surface energies (PTFE or glass), which they would have to cross in order to escape the experimental arena. The barrier experiments were conducted for a range of humidities (10–70%). Experimental results and scanning electron microscopy confirm that particulate powders adversely affect the adhesive ability of both species of ant on smooth substrates via contamination of the arolia. Specifically, the loss of adhesion was found to depend strongly on particle diameter, but only weakly on particle type, with the greatest loss occurring for particle diameters smaller than the claw dimensions of each species, and no effect of humidity was found. We also observed that ants were repelled by the powder barriers which led to a decrease of adhesion prior to their eventual crossing, suggesting that insect antennae may play a role in probing the mechanical fragility of substrates before crossing them."},{"title":"A novel function for a carotenoid: astaxanthin used as a polarizer for visual signalling in a mantis shrimp","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/584","abstract":"Biological signals based on color patterns are well known, but some animals communicate by producing patterns of polarized light. Known biological polarizers are all based on physical interactions with light such as birefringence, differential reflection or scattering. We describe a novel biological polarizer in a marine crustacean based on linear dichroism of a carotenoid molecule. The red-colored, dichroic ketocarotenoid pigment astaxanthin is deposited in the antennal scale of a stomatopod crustacean, Odontodactylus scyllarus. Positive correlation between partial polarization and the presence of astaxanthin indicates that the antennal scale polarizes light with astaxanthin. Both the optical properties and the fine structure of the polarizationally active cuticle suggest that the dipole axes of the astaxanthin molecules are oriented nearly normal to the surface of the antennal scale. While dichroic retinoids are used as visual pigment chromophores to absorb and detect polarized light, this is the first demonstration of the use of a carotenoid to produce a polarizing signal. By using the intrinsic dichroism of the carotenoid molecule and orienting the molecule in tissue, nature has engineered a previously undescribed form of biological polarizer."},{"title":"Hydraulic leg extension is not necessarily the main drive in large spiders","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/578","abstract":"Unlike most other arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in major leg joints. Therefore, hydraulic pressure generated in the prosoma provides leg extension. For decades, this mechanism was held responsible for the generation of the majority of the ground reaction forces, particularly in the hind legs. During propulsion, the front leg pairs must shorten whereas the hind legs have to be extended. Assuming that hind legs are essentially driven by hydraulics, their force vectors must pass the leg joints ventrally. However, at least in accelerated escape manoeuvres, we show here for the large cursorial spider species Ancylometes concolor that these force vectors, when projected into the leg plane, pass all leg joints dorsally. This indicates a reduced impact of the hydraulic mechanism on the generation of ground reaction forces. Although hydraulic leg extension still modulates their direction, the observed steep force vectors at the hind legs indicate a strong activity of flexors in the proximal joint complex that push the legs against the substrate. Consequently, the muscular mechanisms are dominant at least in the hind legs of large spiders."},{"title":"Hydrodynamics of the bluegill sunfish C-start escape response: three-dimensional simulations and comparison with experimental data","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/671","abstract":"In this work we study the hydrodynamics of a bluegill sunfish performing a C-start maneuver in unprecedented detail using 3-D numerical simulations guided by previous laboratory experiments with live fish. The 3-D fish body geometry and kinematics are reconstructed from the experiments using high-speed video and prescribed as input to the numerical simulation. The calculated instantaneous flow fields at various stages of the C-start maneuver are compared with the two-dimensional particle image velocimetry measurements, and are shown to capture essentially all flow features observed in the measurements with good quantitative accuracy; the simulations reveal the experimentally observed three primary jet flow patterns whose momentum time series are in very good agreement with the measured flow field. The simulations elucidate for the first time the complex 3-D structure of the wake during C-starts, revealing an intricate vortical structure consisting of multiple connected vortex loops at the end of the C-start. We also find that the force calculated based on the 3-D flow field has higher magnitudes than that implied by the jet momentum on the midplane, and it exhibits large and rapid fluctuations during the two stages of the C-start. These fluctuations are physical and are related to the change in the direction of the acceleration of the fish body, which changes the location of the high and low pressure pockets around the fish."},{"title":"Rheb, an activator of target of rapamycin, in the blackback land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis: cloning and effects of molting and unweighting on expression in skeletal muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/590","abstract":"Molt-induced claw muscle atrophy in decapod crustaceans facilitates exuviation and is coordinated by ecdysteroid hormones. There is a 4-fold reduction in mass accompanied by remodeling of the contractile apparatus, which is associated with an 11-fold increase in myofibrillar protein synthesis by the end of the premolt period. Loss of a walking limb or claw causes a loss of mass in the associated thoracic musculature; this unweighting atrophy occurs in intermolt and is ecdysteroid independent. Myostatin (Mstn) is a negative regulator of muscle growth in mammals; it suppresses protein synthesis, in part, by inhibiting the insulin/metazoan target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Signaling via mTOR activates translation by phosphorylating ribosomal S6 kinase (s6k) and 4E-binding protein 1. Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), a GTP-binding protein, is a key activator of mTOR and is inhibited by Rheb-GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Akt protein kinase inactivates Rheb-GAP, thus slowing Rheb-GTPase activity and maintaining mTOR in the active state. We hypothesized that the large increase in global protein synthesis in claw muscle was due to regulation of mTOR activity by ecdysteroids, caused either directly or indirectly via Mstn. In the blackback land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis, a Mstn-like gene (Gl-Mstn) is downregulated as much as 17-fold in claw muscle during premolt and upregulated 3-fold in unweighted thoracic muscle during intermolt. Gl-Mstn expression in claw muscle is negatively correlated with hemolymph ecdysteroid level. Full-length cDNAs encoding Rheb orthologs from three crustacean species (G. lateralis, Carcinus maenas and Homarus americanus), as well as partial cDNAs encoding Akt (Gl-Akt), mTOR (Gl-mTOR) and s6k (Gl-s6k) from G. lateralis, were cloned. The effects of molting on insulin/mTOR signaling components were quantified in claw closer, weighted thoracic and unweighted thoracic muscles using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Gl-Rheb mRNA levels increased 3.4-fold and 3.9-fold during premolt in claw muscles from animals induced to molt by eyestalk ablation (ESA) and multiple leg autotomy (MLA), respectively, and mRNA levels were positively correlated with hemolymph ecdysteroids. There was little or no effect of molting on Gl-Rheb expression in weighted thoracic muscle and no correlation of Gl-Rheb mRNA with ecdysteroid titer. There were significant changes in Gl-Akt, Gl-mTOR and Gl-s6k expression with molt stage. These changes were transient and were not correlated with hemolymph ecdysteroids. The two muscles differed in terms of the relationship between Gl-Rheb and Gl-Mstn expression. In thoracic muscle, Gl-Rheb mRNA was positively correlated with Gl-Mstn mRNA in both ESA and MLA animals. By contrast, Gl-Rheb mRNA in claw muscle was negatively correlated with Gl-Mstn mRNA in ESA animals, and no correlation was observed in MLA animals. Unweighting increased Gl-Rheb expression in thoracic muscle at all molt stages; the greatest difference (2.2-fold) was observed in intermolt animals. There was also a 1.3-fold increase in Gl-s6k mRNA level in unweighted thoracic muscle. These data indicate that the mTOR pathway is upregulated in atrophic muscles. Gl-Rheb, in particular, appears to play a role in the molt-induced increase in protein synthesis in the claw muscle."},{"title":"Growth and innate immunity are not limited by selection for high egg testosterone content in Japanese quail","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/617","abstract":"The effects of maternal androgens on fitness-related traits of offspring are generally assumed to be epigenetic adaptations to the environment that may be encountered by the next generation. Possible constraints of high yolk androgen transfer are still not understood, although a suppressed immune response in offspring is frequently considered. The aim of our study was to examine the innate immune defence in high (HET) and low egg testosterone (LET) lines of Japanese quail, which differ in the hormonal milieu of their eggs, thus providing a good physiological model for the study of androgen-mediated maternal effects. Acute phase response was induced by a lipopolysaccharide injection in 12-day-old quail and plasma corticosterone and the heterophil:lymphocyte ratio were measured at 1 and 3 h post-treatment. Basal levels of non-specific antibodies (IgY) were determined in the circulation. We found that HET quail were heavier than LET quail from the second week of age, indicating enhanced post-hatching growth. At 1 h post-lipopolysaccharide challenge, plasma corticosterone concentrations increased in the HET but not in the LET line. The heterophil:lymphocyte ratio rose in both lines at 3 h post-immune challenge, with a more pronounced response in HET quail. Moreover, HET chicks displayed higher IgY levels than LET chicks, suggesting either enhanced passive immunoprotection or stimulated endogenous antibody production. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the genetic selection for high egg testosterone content positively influences growth and, simultaneously, does not limit the acute phase response in young quail."},{"title":"Establishing food site vectors in desert ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/653","abstract":"When returning to the site of a successful previous forage, where does one search for the goodies? Should one rely on experience from the previous homebound journey, or should one consider the outbound journey as well, or even exclusively? Desert ants are particularly well suited for pursuing this question because of their primary reliance on path integration in open and featureless desert habitats. Path integration has been studied particularly with regard to homing after lengthy foraging trips. The ants also use path integration to return to plentiful feeding sites, but what is memorised for revisiting the feeder remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate that desert ants consider, and indeed linearly average, both outbound and inbound travel for their return to a familiar feeder. This may be interpreted as a strategy to reduce navigation errors."},{"title":"Smelling your way to food: can bed bugs use our odour?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/623","abstract":"The resurgence in developed countries of the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, has led to a search for new sustainable methods to monitor and control this human ectoparasite. Because of increased resistance to insecticides, traps baited with attractive cues are considered a promising method to be developed into efficient monitoring tools for bed bugs. Despite their potential as attractants, only a few studies have investigated the odorant cues implicated in the attraction of bed bugs to human hosts. In this study, we used aeration extracts from human volunteers to assess the role of olfaction in host searching by bed bugs. By coupled gas chromatography and single sensillum recordings on all the antennal sensilla, we measured the electrophysiological response elicited by the compounds present in our human odour extracts. Only five compounds were clearly detected by the olfactory receptor neurons housed in the smooth-peg sensilla of the bed bugs. We tested the behavioural effect of these extracts in a still-air arena and showed a gradient of repellence linked to the dose, as well as a higher propensity of local search behaviour associated with human odours containing a lower ratio of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one to C7–C10 aldehydes. We conclude that human odour alone has a weak influence on the behaviour of C. lectularius and we propose that human kairomones may have a significant impact on bed bug behaviour in combination with heat and carbon dioxide, the only two currently known attractive vertebrate cues used by bed bugs for host seeking."},{"title":"Transient Ca2+ mobilization caused by osmotic shock initiates salmonid fish sperm motility","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/630","abstract":"Salmonid fish sperm motility is known to be suppressed in millimolar concentrations of extracellular K+, and dilution of K+ upon spawning triggers cAMP-dependent signaling for motility initiation. In a previous study, however, we demonstrated that suspending sperm in a 10% glycerol solution and subsequent dilution into a low-osmotic solution induced motility independently of extracellular K+ and cAMP. In the present study, we further investigated the glycerol-induced motility mechanism. We found that treatment with solutions consisting of organic or inorganic ions, as well as glycerol, induced sperm motility in an osmolarity-dependent manner. Elimination of intracellular Ca2+ by BAPTA-AM significantly inhibited glycerol-treated sperm motility, whereas removal of extracellular Ca2+ by EGTA did not. Monitoring intracellular Ca2+, using fluo-4, revealed that intracellular Ca2+ increased when sperm were suspended in hypertonic solutions, and a subsequent dilution into a hypotonic solution led to a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ concomitant with motility initiation. In addition, upon dilution of sperm into a hypertonic glycerol solution prior to demembranation, the motility of demembranated sperm was reactivated in the absence of cAMP. The motility recovery suggests that completion of axonemal maturation occurred during exposure to a hypertonic environment. As a result, it is likely that glycerol treatment of sperm undergoing hypertonic shock causes mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ from the intracellular Ca2+ store and also causes maturation of axonemal proteins for motility initiation. The subsequent dilution into a hypotonic solution induces a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ and flagellar movement. This novel mechanism of sperm motility initiation seems to act in a salvaging manner for the well-known K+-dependent pathway."},{"title":"Branchial ionocyte organization and ion-transport protein expression in juvenile alewives acclimated to freshwater or seawater","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/642","abstract":"The alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) is a clupeid that undergoes larval and juvenile development in freshwater preceding marine habitation. The purpose of this study was to investigate osmoregulatory mechanisms in alewives that permit homeostasis in different salinities. To this end, we measured physiological, branchial biochemical and cellular responses in juvenile alewives acclimated to freshwater (0.5 p.p.t.) or seawater (35.0 p.p.t.). Plasma chloride concentration was higher in seawater-acclimated than freshwater-acclimated individuals (141 mmol l–1 vs 134 mmol l–1), but the hematocrit remained unchanged. In seawater-acclimated individuals, branchial Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity was higher by 75%. Western blot analysis indicated that the abundance of the NKA α-subunit and a Na+/K+/2Cl– cotransporter (NKCC1) were greater in seawater-acclimated individuals by 40% and 200%, respectively. NKA and NKCC1 were localized on the basolateral surface and tubular network of ionocytes in both acclimation groups. Immunohistochemical labeling for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) was restricted to the apical crypt of ionocytes in seawater-acclimated individuals, whereas sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) labeling was present on the apical surface of ionocytes in both acclimation groups. Ionocytes were concentrated on the trailing edge of the gill filament, evenly distributed along the proximal 75% of the filamental axis and reduced distally. Ionocyte size and number on the gill filament were not affected by salinity; however, the number of lamellar ionocytes was significantly lower in seawater-acclimated fish. Confocal z-series reconstructions revealed that mature ionocytes in seawater-acclimated alewives occurred in multicellular complexes. These complexes might reduce paracellular Na+ resistance, hence facilitating Na+ extrusion in hypo-osmoregulating juvenile alewives after seaward migration."},{"title":"Glass scales on the wing of the swordtail butterfly Graphium sarpedon act as thin film polarizing reflectors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/657","abstract":"The wings of the swordtail butterfly Graphium sarpedon (the Common Bluebottle) have blue/green-colored patches that are covered on the underside by two types of scales: white and glass scales. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the white scales are classically structured: the upper lamina, with prominent ridges and large open windows, is well separated by trabeculae from a flat, continuous lower lamina. In the glass scales, the upper lamina, with inconspicuous ridges and windows, is almost flat and closely apposed to the equally flat lower lamina. The glass scales thus approximate ideal thin films, in agreement with the observation that they reflect light directionally and are iridescent. Reflectance and transmittance spectra measured from the glass scales with a microspectrophotometer agree with spectra calculated for an ideal non-absorbing thin film. Imaging scatterometry of single, isolated glass scales demonstrated that the reflected light can be strongly polarized, indicating that they function as polarizing reflectors."},{"title":"Differences in locomotor performance between individuals: importance of parvalbumin, calcium handling and metabolism","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/663","abstract":"Locomotor performance is linked to fitness and health of animals and is expected to be under strong selection. However, interindividual variation in locomotor performance is pronounced in many species. It was our aim to investigate the relative importance of energy metabolism and calcium handling in determining sprint and sustained locomotion in the zebrafish (Danio rerio). Sprint and sustained performance (Ucrit) varied independently from each other. Using in vivo electroporation, we found that increased parvalbumin protein concentration improved both sprint and sustained locomotion. This is the first demonstration that parvalbumin plays a role in determining whole-animal performance. High sprint performance fish had greater mRNA concentrations of the metabolic regulators PPARδ and PGC1β compared with fish with poor sprint performance. High sustained performance fish, in contrast, had greater concentrations of PGC-1α and PGC-1β. The increased expression of these metabolic regulators indicates an enhancement of the metabolic machinery in high performance animals. Sprint performance is also enhanced by creatine kinase activity, which may be associated with increased PPARδ mRNA concentration. Ryanodine receptor (RyR) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 1 (SERCA1) mRNA concentrations were significantly increased in high sustained performance fish, while parvalbumin 2, dihydropyridine (DHPR) receptor and SERCA2 mRNA levels were increased in fish with high sprint velocities. Sustained performance was more sensitive to experimentally induced decreases in RyR and DHPR activity than sprint performance. We provide mechanistic explanations of why locomotor performance differs between individuals, which is important for understanding ecological and sporting success, disease and the evolutionary processes underlying selection."},{"title":"First evidence of epithelial transport in tardigrades: a comparative investigation of organic anion transport","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/497","abstract":"We investigated transport of the organic anion Chlorophenol Red (CPR) in the tardigrade Halobiotus crispae using a new method for quantifying non-fluorescent dyes. We compared the results acquired from the tardigrade with CPR transport data obtained from Malpighian tubules of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria. CPR accumulated in the midgut lumen of H. crispae, indicating that organic anion transport takes place here. Our results show that CPR transport is inhibited by the mitochondrial un-coupler DNP (1 mmol l–1; 81% reduction), the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain (10 mmol l–1; 21% reduction) and the vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin (5 μmol l–1; 21% reduction), and by the organic anions PAH (10 mmol l–1; 44% reduction) and probenecid (10 mmol l–1; 61% reduction, concentration-dependent inhibition). Transport by locust Malpighian tubules exhibits a similar pharmacological profile, albeit with markedly higher concentrations of CPR being reached in S. gregaria. Immunolocalization of the Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit in S. gregaria revealed that this transporter is abundantly expressed and localized to the basal cell membranes. Immunolocalization data could not be obtained from H. crispae. Our results indicate that organic anion secretion by the tardigrade midgut is transporter mediated with likely candidates for the basolateral entry step being members of the Oat and/or Oatp transporter families. From our results, we cautiously suggest that apical H+ and possibly basal Na+/K+ pumps provide the driving force for the transport; the exact coupling between electrochemical gradients generated by the pumps and transport of ions, as well as the nature of the apical exit step, are unknown. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to show active epithelial transport in tardigrades."},{"title":"Independence of net water flux from paracellular permeability in the intestine of Fundulus heteroclitus, a euryhaline teleost","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/508","abstract":"Paracellular permeability and absorptive water flux across the intestine of the euryhaline killifish were investigated using in vitro gut sac preparations from seawater- and freshwater-acclimated animals. The permeability of polyethylene glycol (PEG), a well-established paracellular probe, was measured using trace amounts of radiolabelled oligomers of three different molecular sizes (PEG-400, PEG-900 and PEG-4000) at various times after satiation feeding. All three PEG molecules were absorbed, with permeability declining as a linear function of increasing hydrodynamic radius. Response patterns were similar in seawater and freshwater preparations, though water absorption and PEG-900 permeability were greater in the latter. Despite up to 4-fold variations in absorptive water flux associated with feeding and fasting (highest at 1–3 h, lowest at 12–24 h and intermediate at 1–2 weeks post-feeding), there were no changes in PEG permeability for any size oligomer. When PEG permeability was measured in the opposite direction (i.e. serosal to mucosal) from net water flux, it was again unchanged. HgCl2 (10–3 mol l–1), a putative blocker of aquaporins, eliminated absorptive water flux yet increased PEG-4000 permeability by 6- to 8-fold in both freshwater and seawater preparations. Experimentally raising the serosal osmolality by addition of 300 mmol l–1 mannitol increased the absorptive water flux rate 10-fold, but did not alter PEG permeability. Under these conditions, HgCl2 reduced absorptive water flux by 60% and again increased PEG permeability by 6- to 8-fold in both freshwater and seawater preparations. Clearly, there was no influence of solvent drag on PEG movement. The putative paracellular blocker 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (TAP, 20 mmol l–1) had no effect on net water flux or PEG permeability. We conclude that PEG and water move by separate pathways; absorptive water transport probably occurs via a transcellular route in the intestine of Fundulus heteroclitus."},{"title":"Kinematics of quadrupedal locomotion in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps): effects of age and substrate size","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/480","abstract":"Arboreal mammals face unique challenges to locomotor stability. This is particularly true with respect to juveniles, who must navigate substrates similar to those traversed by adults, despite a reduced body size and neuromuscular immaturity. Kinematic differences exhibited by juveniles and adults on a given arboreal substrate could therefore be due to differences in body size relative to substrate size, to differences in neuromuscular development, or to both. We tested the effects of relative body size and age on quadrupedal kinematics in a small arboreal marsupial (the sugar glider, Petaurus breviceps; body mass range of our sample 33-97 g). Juvenile and adult P. breviceps were filmed moving across a flat board and three poles 2.5, 1.0 and 0.5 cm in diameter. Sugar gliders (regardless of age or relative speed) responded to relative decreases in substrate diameter with kinematic adjustments that promote stability; they increased duty factor, increased the average number of supporting limbs during a stride, increased relative stride length and decreased relative stride frequency. Limb phase increased when moving from the flat board to the poles, but not among poles. Compared with adults, juveniles (regardless of relative body size or speed) used lower limb phases, more pronounced limb flexion, and enhanced stability with higher duty factors and a higher average number of supporting limbs during a stride. We conclude that although substrate variation in an arboreal environment presents similar challenges to all individuals, regardless of age or absolute body size, neuromuscular immaturity confers unique problems to growing animals, requiring kinematic compensation."},{"title":"Origin and mechanism of thermal insensitivity in mole hemoglobins: a test of the ‘additional’ chloride binding site hypothesis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/518","abstract":"The structural and evolutionary origins underlying the effect of temperature on the O2 binding properties of mammalian hemoglobins (Hbs) are poorly understood, despite their potential physiological importance. Previous work has shown that the O2 affinities of the blood of the coast mole (Scapanus orarius) and the eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus) are significantly less sensitive to temperature changes than that of the star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata). It was suggested that this difference may arise from the binding of ‘additional’ chloride ions within a cationic pocket between residues 8His, 76Lys and 77Asn on the β-like δ-globin chains of coast and eastern mole Hbs. To test this hypothesis, we deduced the primary sequences of star-nosed mole and American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii) Hb, measured the sensitivity of these respiratory proteins to allosteric effector molecules and temperature, and calculated their overall oxygenation enthalpies (ΔH′). Here we show that the variability in ΔH′ seen among mole Hbs cannot be attributed to differential Cl– binding at δ8, δ76 and δ77, as the Cl– sensitivity of mole Hbs is unaffected by amino acid changes at this site (i.e. the proposed ‘additional’ Cl– binding site is not operational in mole Hbs). Rather, we demonstrate that the numerically low ΔH′ of coast and eastern mole Hbs results from heightened proton binding relative to other mole Hbs. Comparative sequence analysis and molecular modelling moreover suggest that this attribute evolved in a common ancestor of these two fossorial lineages and arises from the development of a salt bridge between a pair of amino acid residues (δ125His and α34Glu/Asp) that are not present in other mole Hbs."},{"title":"Sensory input from the osphradium modulates the response to memory-enhancing stressors in Lymnaea stagnalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/536","abstract":"In the freshwater environment species often rely on chemosensory information to modulate behavior. The pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, is a model species used to characterize the causal mechanisms of long-term memory (LTM) formation. Chemical stressors including crayfish kairomones and KCl enhance LTM formation (≥24 h) in Lymnaea; however, how these stressors are sensed and the mechanism by which they affect the electrophysiological properties of neurons necessary for memory formation are poorly understood. Here, we assessed whether the osphradium, a primary chemosensory organ in Lymnaea, modulates LTM enhancement. To test this we severed the osphradial nerve proximal to the osphradium, using sham-operated animals as controls, and assessed the behavioral and electrophysiological response to crayfish kairomones and KCl. We operantly conditioned aerial respiratory behavior in intact, sham and osphradially cut animals, and tested for enhanced memory formation after exposure to the chemical stressors. Sham-operated animals displayed the same memory enhancement as intact animals but snails with a severed osphradial nerve did not show LTM enhancement. Extracellular recordings made from the osphradial nerve demonstrate that these stressors evoked afferent sensory activity. Intracellular recordings from right pedal dorsal 1 (RPeD1), a neuron necessary for LTM formation, demonstrate that its electrophysiological activity is altered by input from the osphradium following exposure to crayfish kairomones or KCl in sham and intact animals but no response is seen in RPeD1 in osphradially cut animals. Therefore, sensory input from the osphradium is necessary for LTM enhancement following exposure to these chemical stressors."},{"title":"The polarization compass dominates over idiothetic cues in path integration of desert ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/526","abstract":"Desert ants, Cataglyphis, use the sky's pattern of polarized light as a compass reference for navigation. However, they do not fully exploit the complexity of this pattern, rather – as proposed previously – they assess their walking direction by means of an approximate solution based on a simplified internal template. Approximate rules are error-prone. We therefore asked whether the ants use additional cues to improve the accuracy of directional decisions, and focused on ‘idiothetic’ cues, i.e. cues based on information from proprioceptors. We trained ants in a channel system that was covered with a polarization filter, providing only a single e-vector direction as a directional ‘celestial’ cue. Then we observed their homebound runs on a test field, allowing full view of the sky. In crucial experiments, the ants were exposed to a cue conflict, in which sky compass and idiothetic information disagreed, by training them in a straight channel that provided a change in e-vector direction. The results indicated that the polarization information completely dominates over idiothetic cues. Two path segments with different e-vector orientations are combined linearly to a summed home vector. Our data provide additional evidence that Cataglyphis uses a simplified internal template to derive directional information from the sky's polarization pattern."},{"title":"Glycogen synthase kinase-3: cryoprotection and glycogen metabolism in the freeze-tolerant wood frog","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/543","abstract":"The terrestrial anuran Rana sylvatica tolerates extended periods of whole-body freezing during the winter. Freezing survival is facilitated by extensive glycogen hydrolysis and distribution of high concentrations of the cryoprotectant glucose into blood and all tissues. As glycogenesis is both an energy-expensive process and counter-productive to maintaining sustained high cryoprotectant levels, we proposed that glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) would be activated when wood frogs froze and would phosphorylate its downstream substrates to inactivate glycogen synthesis. Western blot analysis determined that the amount of phosphorylated (inactive) GSK-3 decreased in all five tissues tested in 24 h frozen frogs compared with unfrozen controls. Total GSK-3 protein levels did not change, with the exception of heart GSK-3, indicating that post-translational modification was the primary regulatory mechanism for this kinase. Kinetic properties of skeletal muscle GSK-3 from control and frozen frogs displayed differential responses to a temperature change (22 versus 4°C) and high glucose. For example, when assayed at 4°C, the Km for the GSK-3 substrate peptide was ∼44% lower for frozen frogs than the corresponding value in control frogs, indicating greater GSK-3 affinity for its substrates in the frozen state. This indicates that at temperatures similar to the environment encountered by frogs, GSK-3 in frozen frogs will phosphorylate its downstream targets more readily than in unfrozen controls. GSK-3 from skeletal muscle of control frogs was also allosterically regulated. AMP and phosphoenolpyruvate activated GSK-3 whereas inhibitors included glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, ATP, glutamate, glutamine, glycerol, NH4Cl, NaCl and KCl. The combination of phosphorylation and allosteric control argues for a regulatory role of GSK-3 in inactivating glycogenesis to preserve high glucose cryoprotectant levels throughout each freezing bout."},{"title":"Warmer is better: thermal sensitivity of both maximal and sustained power output in the iliotibialis muscle isolated from adult Xenopus tropicalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/552","abstract":"Environmental temperature varies temporally and spatially and may consequently affect organismal function in complex ways. Effects of temperature are often most pertinent on locomotor performance traits of ectothermic animals. Given the importance of locomotion to mobility and dispersion, variability in temperature may therefore affect the current and future distribution of species. Many previous studies have demonstrated that burst muscle performance changes with temperature. However, less is known about the effects of temperature on sustained skeletal muscle performance. The iliotibialis muscle was isolated from eight male Xenopus tropicalis individuals and subjected to in vitro isometric and work-loop studies at test temperatures of 15, 24, 30 and 32°C. Work-loop power output (average power per cycle) was maximised at each temperature by altering stimulation and strain parameters. A series of 10 work loops was also delivered at each test temperature to quantify endurance performance. Warmer test temperatures tended to increase twitch stress (force normalised to muscle cross-sectional area) and significantly increased tetanic stress. Increased temperature significantly reduced twitch and tetanus activation and relaxation times. Increased temperature also significantly increased both burst muscle power output (cycle average) and sustained (endurance) performance during work loop studies. The increase in burst power output between 15 and 24°C yielded a high Q10 value of 6.86. Recent studies have demonstrated that the negative effects of inorganic phosphate accumulation during prolonged skeletal muscle performance are reduced with increased temperature, possibly explaining the increases in endurance found with increased test temperature in the present study."},{"title":"Long-term memory and response generalization in mushroom body extrinsic neurons in the honeybee Apis mellifera","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/559","abstract":"Honeybees learn to associate an odor with sucrose reward under conditions that allow the monitoring of neural activity by imaging Ca2+ transients in morphologically identified neurons.

The neurons' responses to the learned odor and two novel control odors were measured 24 h after learning. We found that calcium responses to the learned odor and an odor that was strongly generalized with it were enhanced compared with responses to a weakly generalized control. Thus, the physiological responses measured in these extrinsic neurons accurately reflect what is observed in behavior. We conclude that the recorded recurrent neurons feed information back to the mushroom body about the features of learned odor stimuli. Other extrinsic neurons may signal information about learned odors to different brain regions."},{"title":"Seeing near and seeing far; behavioural evidence for dual mechanisms of pattern vision in the honeybee (Apis mellifera)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/397","abstract":"Visual perception is a primary modality for interacting with complex environments. Recent work has shown that the brain and visual system of the honeybee is able, in some cases, to learn complex spatial relationships, while in other cases, bee vision is relatively rudimentary and based upon simple elemental-type visual processing. In the present study, we test the ability of honeybees to learn 4-bar asymmetric patterns in a Y-maze with aversive–appetitive differential conditioning. In Experiment 1, a group of bees were trained at a small visual angle of 50 deg by constraining individuals to the decision chamber within the Y-maze. Bees learned this task, and were able to solve the task even in the presence of background noise. However, these bees failed to solve the task when the stimuli were presented at a novel visual angle of 100 deg. In Experiment 2, a separate group of bees were trained to sets of 4-bar asymmetric patterns that excluded retinotopic matching and, in this case, bees learned the configural rule describing stimuli at a visual angle of approximately 50 deg, and this allowed the bees to solve the task when the stimuli were presented at a novel vision angle of 100 deg. This shows that the bee brain contains multiple mechanisms for pattern recognition, and what a bee sees is very dependent upon the specific experience that it receives. These multiple mechanisms would allow bees to interact with complex environments to solve tasks like recognising landmarks at variable distances or quickly discriminating between rewarding/non-rewarding flowers at reasonable constant visual angles."},{"title":"Flexural stiffness of feather shafts: geometry rules over material properties","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/405","abstract":"Flight feathers of birds interact with the flow field during flight. They bend and twist under aerodynamic loads. Two parameters are mainly responsible for flexibility in feathers: the elastic modulus (Young's modulus, E) of the material (keratin) and the geometry of the rachises, more precisely the second moment of area (I). Two independent methods were employed to determine Young's modulus of feather rachis keratin. Moreover, the second moment of area and the bending stiffness of feather shafts from fifth primaries of barn owls (Tyto alba) and pigeons (Columba livia) were calculated. These species of birds are of comparable body mass but differ in wing size and flight style. Whether their feather material (keratin) underwent an adaptation in stiffness was previously unknown. This study shows that no significant variation in Young's modulus between the two species exists. However, differences in Young's modulus between proximal and distal feather regions were found in both species. Cross-sections of pigeon rachises were particularly well developed and rich in structural elements, exemplified by dorsal ridges and a well-pronounced transversal septum. In contrast, cross-sections of barn owl rachises were less profiled but had a higher second moment of area. Consequently, the calculated bending stiffness (EI) was higher in barn owls as well. The results show that flexural stiffness is predominantly influenced by the geometry of the feathers rather than by local material properties."},{"title":"Brain activation pattern depends on the strategy chosen by zebra finches to solve an orientation task","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/426","abstract":"Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) were trained to find food in one of four feeders on the floor of an aviary.

Half of the birds used one strategy and half used the other. According to the strategy applied, different brain areas were activated, as demonstrated by c-Fos immunohistochemistry. The hippocampus was activated when spatial cues were used, while in birds orienting using the pattern of the feeder, part of the collothalamic (tectofugal) visual system showed stronger activation. The visual wulst of the lemnothalamic (thalamofugal) visual system was activated with both strategies, indicating an involvement in both spatial and pattern-directed orientation. Because the experimental situation was the same for all zebra finches, the activation pattern was only dependent on the strategy that was voluntarily chosen by each of the birds."},{"title":"Wake structures behind a swimming robotic lamprey with a passively flexible tail","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/416","abstract":"A robotic lamprey, based on the silver lamprey, Ichthyomyzon unicuspis, was used to investigate the influence of passive tail flexibility on the wake structure and thrust production during anguilliform swimming. A programmable microcomputer actuated 11 servomotors that produce a traveling wave along the length of the lamprey body. The waveform was based on kinematic studies of living lamprey, and the shape of the tail was taken from a computer tomography scan of the silver lamprey. The tail was constructed of flexible PVC gel, and nylon inserts were used to change its degree of flexibility. Particle image velocimetry measurements using three different levels of passive flexibility show that the large-scale structure of the wake is dominated by the formation of two pairs of vortices per shedding cycle, as seen in the case of a tail that flexed actively according to a pre-defined kinematic pattern, and did not bend in response to fluid forces. When the tail is passively flexible, however, the large structures are composed of a number of smaller vortices, and the wake loses coherence as the degree of flexibility increases. Momentum balance calculations indicate that, at a given tailbeat frequency, increasing the tail flexibility yields less net force, but changing the cycle frequency to match the resonant frequency of the tail increases the force production."},{"title":"Time-varying motor control of autotomized leopard gecko tails: multiple inputs and behavioral modulation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/435","abstract":"Autotomy (voluntary loss of an appendage) is common among diverse groups of vertebrates and invertebrates, and much attention has been given to ecological and developmental aspects of tail autotomy in lizards. Although most studies have focused on the ramifications for the lizard (behavior, biomechanics, energetics, etc.), the tail itself can exhibit interesting behaviors once segregated from the body. For example, recent work highlighted the ability of leopard gecko tails to jump and flip, in addition to being able to swing back and forth. Little is known, however, about the control mechanisms underlying these movements. Using electromyography, we examined the time-varying in vivo motor patterns at four sites (two proximal and two distal) in the tail of the leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius, following autotomy. Using these data we tested the hypothesis that the disparity in movements results simply from overlapping pattern generators within the tail. We found that burst duration, but not cycle duration, of the rhythmic swings reached a plateau at approximately 150 s following autotomy. This is likely because of physiological changes related to muscle fatigue and ischemia. For flips and jumps, burst and cycle duration exhibited no regular pattern. The coefficient of variation in motor patterns was significantly greater for jumps and flips than for rhythmic swings. This supports the conclusion that the different tail behaviors do not stem from overlapping pattern generators, but that they rely upon independent neural circuits. The signal controlling jumps and flips may be modified by sensory information from the environment. Finally, we found that jumps and flips are initiated using relatively synchronous activity between the two sides of the tail. In contrast, alternating activation of the right and left sides of the tail result in rhythmic swings. The mechanism underlying this change in tail behavior is comparable to locomotor gait changes in vertebrates."},{"title":"The correlation between locomotor performance and hindlimb kinematics during burst locomotion in the Florida scrub lizard, Sceloporus woodi","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/442","abstract":"Burst locomotion is thought to be closely linked to an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. During the burst, animals start from a standstill and then rapidly accelerate to near-maximum running speeds. Many previous studies have described the functional predictors of maximum running speed; however, only recently has work emerged that describes the morphological, functional and biomechanical underpinnings of acceleration capacity. Herein we present data on the three-dimensional hindlimb kinematics during burst locomotion, and the relationship between burst locomotor kinematics and locomotor performance in a small terrestrial lizard (Sceloporus woodi). We focus only on stance phase joint angular kinematics. Sceloporus woodi exhibited considerable variation in hindlimb kinematics and performance across the first three strides of burst locomotion. Stride 1 was defined by larger joint angular excursions at the knee and ankle; by stride 3, the knee and ankle showed smaller joint angular excursions. The hip swept through similar arcs across all strides, with most of the motion caused by femoral retraction and rotation. Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) kinematics exhibited smaller maximum angles in stride 1 compared with strides 2 and 3. The significant correlations between angular kinematics and locomotor performance were different across the first three strides. For stride 1, MTP kinematics predicted final maximum running speed; this correlation is likely explained by a correlation between stride 1 MTP kinematics and stride 2 acceleration performance. For stride 3, several aspects of joint kinematics at each joint predicted maximum running speed. Overall, S. woodi exhibits markedly different kinematics, performance and kinematics-performance correlations across the first three strides. This finding suggests that future studies of burst locomotion and acceleration performance should perform analyses on a stride-by-stride basis and avoid combining data from different strides across the burst locomotor event. Finally, the kinematics-performance correlations observed in S. woodi were quite different from those described for other species, suggesting that there is not a single kinematic pattern that is optimal for high burst performance."},{"title":"Worker division of labor and endocrine physiology are associated in the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex californicus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/454","abstract":"In Pogonomyrmex californicus harvester ants, an age-associated division of labor occurs in the worker caste, in which young workers perform in-nest tasks and older workers forage for food. Here, we tested whether this behavioral division is age based or age flexible, and whether it coincides with differential expression of systemic hormones with known roles in behavioral regulation. Whole-body content of juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids was determined in workers from (1) age-typical colonies, in which a typical age structure is maintained and workers transition across behaviors naturally, and (2) single-cohort colonies, which are entirely composed of same-aged workers, facilitating the establishment of age-independent division of labor. Foragers from both colony types had higher JH and lower ecdysteroid content than workers performing in-nest tasks, suggesting that age is not the sole determinant of worker behavior. This association between hormone content and behavior of P. californicus workers is similar to that previously observed in founding queens of this species. Because these hormones are key regulators of development and reproductive behavior, our data are consistent with the reproductive ground plan hypothesis (RGPH), which posits that the reproductive regulatory mechanisms of solitary ancestors were co-opted to regulate worker behavior."},{"title":"Phenotypic plasticity in response to dietary salt stress: Na+ and K+ transport by the gut of Drosophila melanogaster larvae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/461","abstract":"Drosophila provides a useful model system for studies of the mechanisms involved in regulation of internal ion levels in response to variations in dietary salt load. This study assessed whether alterations in Na+ and K+ transport by the gut of larval D. melanogaster reared on salt-rich diets contribute to haemolymph ionoregulation. Na+ and K+ fluxes across the isolated guts of third instar larvae reared on control or salt-rich diets were measured using the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET). K+ absorption across the anterior portion of the posterior midgut of larvae reared on diet in which the concentration of KCl was increased 0.4 mol l-1 above that in the control diet was reduced eightfold relative to the same gut segment of larvae reared on the control diet. There was also an increase in the magnitude and extent of K+ secretion across the posterior half of the posterior midgut. Na+ was absorbed across the ileum of larvae reared on the control diet, but was secreted across the ileum of larvae reared on diet in which the concentration of NaCl was increased 0.4 mol l-1 above that in the control diet. There was also a small reduction in the extent of Na+ absorption across the middle midgut of larvae reared on the NaCl-rich diet. The results indicate considerable phenotypic plasticity with respect to K+ and Na+ transport by the gut epithelia of larval D. melanogaster. SIET measurements of K+ and Na+ fluxes along the length of the gut show that ion transport mechanisms of the gut are reconfigured during salt stress so that there are reductions in K+ and Na+ absorption and increases in K+ and Na+ secretion. Together with previously described changes in salt secretion by the Malpighian tubules, these changes contribute to haemolymph ionoregulation."},{"title":"Temperature gradients drive mechanical energy gradients in the flight muscle of Manduca sexta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/3/471","abstract":"A temperature gradient throughout the dominant flight muscle (dorsolongitudinal muscle, DLM1) of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, together with temperature-dependent muscle contractile rates, demonstrates that significant spatial variation in power production is possible within a single muscle. Using in situ work-loop analyses under varying muscle temperatures and phases of activation, we show that regional differences in muscle temperature will induce a spatial gradient in the mechanical power output throughout the DLM1. Indeed, we note that this power gradient spans from positive to negative values across the predicted temperature range. Warm ventral subunits produce positive power at their in vivo operating temperatures, and therefore act as motors. Concurrently, as muscle temperature decreases dorsally, the subunits produce approximately zero mechanical power output, acting as an elastic energy storage source, and negative power output, behaving as a damper. Adjusting the phase of activation further influences the temperature sensitivity of power output, significantly affecting the mechanical power output gradient that is expressed. Additionally, the separate subregions of the DLM1 did not appear to employ significant physiological compensation for the temperature-induced differences in power output. Thus, although the components of a muscle are commonly thought to operate uniformly, a significant within-muscle temperature gradient has the potential to induce a mechanical power gradient, whereby subunits within a muscle operate with separate and distinct functional roles."},{"title":"Predicting the physiological performance of ectotherms in fluctuating thermal environments","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/694","abstract":"Physiological ecologists have long sought to understand the plasticity of organisms in environments that vary widely among years, seasons and even hours. This is now even more important because human-induced climate change is predicted to affect both the mean and variability of the thermal environment. Although environmental change occurs ubiquitously, relatively few researchers have studied the effects of fluctuating environments on the performance of developing organisms. Even fewer have tried to validate a framework for predicting performance in fluctuating environments. Here, we determined whether reaction norms based on performance at constant temperatures (18, 22, 26, 30 and 34°C) could be used to predict embryonic and larval performance of anurans at fluctuating temperatures (18–28°C and 18–34°C). Based on existing theory, we generated hypotheses about the effects of stress and acclimation on the predictability of performance in variable environments. Our empirical models poorly predicted the performance of striped marsh frogs (Limnodynastes peronii) at fluctuating temperatures, suggesting that extrapolation from studies conducted under artificial thermal conditions would lead to erroneous conclusions. During the majority of ontogenetic stages, growth and development in variable environments proceeded more rapidly than expected, suggesting that acute exposures to extreme temperatures enable greater performance than do chronic exposures. Consistent with theory, we predicted performance more accurately for the less variable thermal environment. Our results underscore the need to measure physiological performance under naturalistic thermal conditions when testing hypotheses about thermal plasticity or when parameterizing models of life-history evolution."},{"title":"Muscular tissues of the squid Doryteuthis pealeii express identical myosin heavy chain isoforms: an alternative mechanism for tuning contractile speed","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/239","abstract":"The speed of muscle contraction is largely controlled at the sarcomere level by the ATPase activity of the motor protein myosin. Differences in amino acid sequence in catalytically important regions of myosin yield different myosin isoforms with varying ATPase activities and resulting differences in cross-bridge cycling rates and interfilamentary sliding velocities. Modulation of whole-muscle performance by changes in myosin isoform ATPase activity is regarded as a universal mechanism to tune contractile properties, especially in vertebrate muscles. Invertebrates such as squid, however, may exhibit an alternative mechanism to tune contractile properties that is based on differences in muscle ultrastructure, including variable myofilament and sarcomere lengths. To determine definitively whether contractile properties of squid muscles are regulated via different myosin isoforms (i.e. different ATPase activities), the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the myosin heavy chain from the squid Doryteuthis pealeii were determined from the mantle, arm, tentacle, fin and funnel retractor musculature. We identified three myosin heavy chain isoforms in squid muscular tissues, with differences arising at surface loop 1 and the carboxy terminus. All three isoforms were detected in all five tissues studied. These results suggest that the muscular tissues of D. pealeii express identical myosin isoforms, and it is likely that differences in muscle ultrastructure, not myosin ATPase activity, represent the most important mechanism for tuning contractile speeds."},{"title":"Mechanisms underlying rhythmic locomotion: interactions between activation, tension and body curvature waves","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/211","abstract":"Undulatory animal locomotion arises from three closely related propagating waves that sweep rostrocaudally along the body: activation of segmental muscles by motoneurons (MNs), strain of the body wall, and muscle tension induced by activation and strain. Neuromechanical models that predict the relative propagation speeds of neural/muscle activation, muscle tension and body curvature can reveal crucial underlying control features of the central nervous system and the power-generating mechanisms of the muscle. We provide an analytical explanation of the relative speeds of these three waves based on a model of neuromuscular activation and a model of the body–fluid interactions for leech anguilliform-like swimming. First, we deduced the motoneuron spike frequencies that activate the muscle and the resulting muscle tension during swimming in intact leeches from muscle bending moments. Muscle bending moments were derived from our video-recorded kinematic motion data by our body–fluid interaction model. The phase relationships of neural activation and muscle tension in the strain cycle were then calculated. Our study predicts that the MN activation and body curvature waves have roughly the same speed (the ratio of curvature to MN activation speed ≈0.84), whereas the tension wave travels about twice as fast. The high speed of the tension wave resulting from slow MN activation is explained by the multiplicative effects of MN activation and muscle strain on tension development. That is, the product of two slower waves (activation and strain) with appropriate amplitude, bias and phase can generate a tension wave with twice the propagation speed of the factors. Our study predicts that (1) the bending moment required for swimming is achieved by minimal MN spike frequency, rather than by minimal muscle tension; (2) MN activity is greater in the mid-body than in the head and tail regions; (3) inhibitory MNs not only accelerate the muscle relaxation but also reduce the intrinsic tonus tension during one sector of the swim cycle; and (4) movements of the caudal end are passive during swimming. These predictions await verification or rejection through further experiments on swimming animals."},{"title":"Performance and three-dimensional kinematics of bipedal lizards during obstacle negotiation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/247","abstract":"Bipedal running is common among lizard species, but although the kinematics and performance of this gait have been well characterized, the advantages in biologically relevant situations are still unclear. Obstacle negotiation is a task that is ecologically relevant to many animals while moving at high speeds, such as during bipedal running, yet little is known about how obstacles impact locomotion and performance. We examined the effects of obstacle negotiation on the kinematics and performance of lizards during bipedal locomotion. We quantified three-dimensional kinematics from high-speed video (500 Hz) of six-lined racerunners (Aspidoscelis sexlineata) running on a 3 m racetrack both with and without an obstacle spanning the width of the track. The lizards did not alter their kinematics prior to contacting the obstacle. Although contact with the obstacle caused changes to the hindlimb kinematics, mean forward speed did not differ between treatments. The deviation of the vertical position of the body center of mass did not differ between treatments, suggesting that in the absence of a cost to overall performance, lizards forgo maintaining normal kinematics while negotiating obstacles in favor of a steady body center of mass height to avoid destabilizing locomotion."},{"title":"Total recoil: perch compliance alters jumping performance and kinematics in green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/220","abstract":"Jumping is a common form of locomotion for many arboreal animals. Many species of the arboreal lizard genus Anolis occupy habitats in which they must jump to and from unsteady perches, e.g. narrow branches, vines, grass and leaves. Anoles therefore often use compliant perches that could alter jump performance. In this study we conducted a small survey of the compliance of perches used by the arboreal green anole Anolis carolinensis in the wild (N=54 perches) and then, using perches within the range of compliances used by this species, investigated how perch compliance (flexibility) affects the key jumping variables jump distance, takeoff duration, takeoff angle, takeoff speed and landing angle in A. carolinensis in the laboratory (N=11). We observed that lizards lost contact with compliant horizontal perches prior to perch recoil, and increased perch compliance resulted in decreased jump distance and takeoff speed, likely because of the loss of kinetic energy to the flexion of the perch. However, the most striking effect of perch compliance was an unexpected one; perch recoil following takeoff resulted in the lizards being struck on the tail by the perch, even on the narrowest perches. This interaction between the perch and the tail significantly altered body positioning during flight and landing. These results suggest that although the use of compliant perches in the wild is common for this species, jumping from these perches is potentially costly and may affect survival and behavior, particularly in the largest individuals."},{"title":"Functional properties and cell type specific distribution of Ih channels in leech neurons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/227","abstract":"The hyperpolarisation-activated cation current (Ih) has been described in many vertebrate and invertebrate species and cell types. In neurons, Ih is involved in rhythmogenesis, membrane potential stabilisation and many other functions. In this work, we investigate the distribution and functional properties of Ih in identified leech neurons of intact segmental ganglia. We found Ih in the mechanosensory touch (T), pressure (P) and noxious (N) neurons, as well as in Retzius neurons. The current displayed its largest amplitude in P neurons and we investigated its biophysical and pharmacological properties in these cells. Ih was half-maximally activated at –65 mV and fully activated at –100 mV. The current mutually depended on both Na+ and K+ with a permeability ratio pNa/pK of ∼0.21. The reversal potential was approximately –35 mV. The time course of activation could be approximated by a single time constant of ∼370 ms at –60 mV, but required two time constants at –80 mV of ∼80 and ∼560 ms. The current was half-maximally blocked by 0.3 mmol l–1 Cs+ but was insensitive to the bradycardic agent ZD7288. The physiological function of this channel could be a subtle alteration of the firing behaviour of mechanosensory neurons as well as a stabilisation of the resting membrane potential."},{"title":"High-altitude diving in river otters: coping with combined hypoxic stresses","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/256","abstract":"River otters (Lontra canadensis) are highly active, semi-aquatic mammals indigenous to a range of elevations and represent an appropriate model for assessing the physiological responses to diving at altitude. In this study, we performed blood gas analyses and compared blood chemistry of river otters from a high-elevation (2357 m) population at Yellowstone Lake with a sea-level population along the Pacific coast. Comparisons of oxygen dissociation curves (ODC) revealed no significant difference in hemoglobin-oxygen (Hb-O2) binding affinity between the two populations - potentially because of demands for tissue oxygenation. Instead, high-elevation otters had greater Hb concentrations (18.7 g dl-1) than sea-level otters (15.6 g dl-1). Yellowstone otters displayed higher levels of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO), and half the concentration of the serum protein albumin, possibly to compensate for increased blood viscosity. Despite compensation in several hematological and serological parameters, theoretical aerobic dive limits (ADL) were similar between high-elevation and sea-level otters because of the lower availability of O2 at altitude. Our results suggest that recent disruptions to the Yellowstone Lake food web could be detrimental to otters because at this high elevation, constraints on diving may limit their ability to switch to prey in a deep-water environment."},{"title":"Evidence for damage-dependent hygienic behaviour towards Varroa destructor-parasitised brood in the western honey bee, Apis mellifera","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/264","abstract":"The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and honey bee pathogenic viruses have been implicated in the recent demise of honey bee colonies. Several studies have shown that the combination of V. destructor and deformed wing virus (DWV) poses an especially serious threat to honey bee health. Mites transmitting virulent forms of DWV may cause fatal DWV infections in the developing bee, while pupae parasitised by mites not inducing or activating overt DWV infections may develop normally. Adult bees respond to brood diseases by removing affected brood. This hygienic behaviour is an essential part of the bees' immune response repertoire and is also shown towards mite-parasitised brood. However, it is still unclear whether the bees react towards the mite in the brood cell or rather towards the damage done to the brood. We hypothesised that the extent of mite-associated damage rather than the mere presence of parasitising mites triggers hygienic behaviour. Hygienic behaviour assays performed with mites differing in their potential to transmit overt DWV infections revealed that brood parasitised by ‘virulent’ mites (i.e. mites with a high potential to induce fatal DWV infections in parasitised pupae) were removed significantly more often than brood parasitised by ‘less virulent’ mites (i.e. mites with a very low potential to induce overt DWV infections) or non-parasitised brood. Chemical analyses of brood odour profiles suggested that the bees recognise severely affected brood by olfactory cues. Our results suggest that bees show selective, damage-dependent hygienic behaviour, which may be an economic way for colonies to cope with mite infestation."},{"title":"The influence of surface energy on the self-cleaning of insect adhesive devices","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/279","abstract":"The ability of insects to adhere to surfaces is facilitated by the use of adhesive organs found on the terminal leg segments. These adhesive pads are inherently ‘tacky’ and are expected to be subject to contamination by particulates, leading to loss of function. Here, we investigated the self-cleaning of ants and beetles by comparing the abilities of both hairy and smooth pad forms to self-clean on both high and low energy surfaces after being fouled with microspheres of two sizes and surface energies. We focused on the time taken to regain adhesive potential in unrestrained Hymenopterans (Polyrhachis dives and Myrmica scabrinodis) and Coccinellids (Harmonia axyridis and Adalia bipunctata) fouled with microspheres. We found that the reattainment of adhesion is influenced by particle type and size in Hymenopterans, with an interaction between the surface energy of the contaminating particle and substrate. In Coccinellids, reattainment of adhesion was only influenced by particle size and substrate properties. The adhesive organs of Coccinellids appear to possess superior self-cleaning abilities compared with those of Hymenopterans, although Hymenopterans exhibit better adhesion to both surface types."},{"title":"Constitutive immune function in European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, is decreased immediately after an endurance flight in a wind tunnel","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/272","abstract":"Life-history theory predicts that animals face a trade-off in energy allocation between performing strenuous exercise, such as migratory flight, and mounting an immune response. We experimentally tested this prediction by studying immune function in European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, flown in a wind tunnel. Specifically, we predicted that constitutive immune function decreases in response to training and, additionally, in response to immediate exercise. We compared constitutive immune function among three groups: (1) ‘untrained’ birds that were kept in cages and were not flown; (2) ‘trained’ birds that received flight training over a 15 day period and performed a 1-4 h continuous flight, after which they rested for 48 h before being sampled; and (3) ‘post-flight’ birds that differed from the ‘trained’ group only in being sampled immediately after the final flight. A bird in our trained group represents an individual during migration that has been resting between migratory flights for at least 2 days. A bird in our post-flight group represents an individual that has just completed a migratory flight and has not yet had time to recover. Three of our four indicators (haptoglobin, agglutination and lysis) showed the predicted decrease in immune function in the post-flight group, and two indicators (haptoglobin, agglutination) showed the predicted decreasing trend from the untrained to trained to post-flight group. Haptoglobin levels were negatively correlated with flight duration. No effect of training or flight was detected on leukocyte profiles. Our results suggest that in European starlings, constitutive immune function is decreased more as a result of immediate exercise than of exercise training. Because of the recent emergence of avian-borne diseases, understanding the trade-offs and challenges faced by long-distance migrants has gained a new level of relevance and urgency."},{"title":"Revisiting the effects of crowding and feeding in the gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta: the role of Rhesus glycoproteins in nitrogen metabolism and excretion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/301","abstract":"Models of branchial transport in teleosts have been reshaped by the recent discovery of Rhesus (Rh) glycoproteins, a family of proteins that facilitate the movement of NH3 across cell membranes. This study examines the effects of crowding and feeding on ammonia excretion in gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) within the context of Rh glycoproteins and the ammonia-fixing enzyme, glutamine synthetase (GS). Four Rh isoforms (Rhag, Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2) were isolated from toadfish. Tissue distributions showed higher levels of mRNA expression in the gills and liver, moderate levels in the intestine and lower levels in the stomach. Crowding significantly lowered branchial Rh expression and ammonia excretion rates in fasted toadfish. A comparison of Rh expression in the digestive tract revealed relatively low levels of Rhcg1 and Rhcg2 in the stomach and high mRNA abundance of Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2 in the intestine of fasted, crowded toadfish. We speculate that these trends may reduce secretion and enhance absorption, respectively, to minimize the amount of ammonia that is lost through gastrointestinal routes. By contrast, these patterns of expression were modified in response to an exogenous ammonia load via feeding. Post-prandial ammonia excretion rates were elevated twofold, paralleled by similar increases in branchial Rhcg1 mRNA, gastric Rhcg1 mRNA and mRNA of all intestinal Rh isoforms. These changes were interpreted as an attempt to increase post-prandial ammonia excretion rates into the environment owing to a gradient created by elevated circulating ammonia concentrations and acidification of the digestive tract. Overall, we provide evidence that toadfish modulate both the expression of Rh isoforms and urea synthesis pathways to tightly control and regulate nitrogen excretion."},{"title":"Interactions between cortisol and Rhesus glycoprotein expression in ureogenic toadfish, Opsanus beta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/314","abstract":"In their native environment, gulf toadfish excrete equal quantities of ammonia and urea. However, upon exposure to stressful conditions in the laboratory (i.e. crowding, confinement or air exposure), toadfish decrease branchial ammonia excretion and become ureotelic. The objective of this study was to determine the influences of cortisol and ammonia on ammonia excretion relative to expression of Rhesus (Rh) glycoproteins and the ammonia-fixing enzyme, glutamine synthetase (GS). In vivo infusions and/or injections were used to manipulate corticosteroid activity and plasma ammonia concentrations in ureotelic toadfish. Metyrapone treatment to lower circulating cortisol levels resulted in a 3.5-fold elevation of ammonia excretion rates, enhanced mRNA expression of two of the toadfish Rh isoforms (Rhcg1 and Rhcg2), and decreased branchial and hepatic GS activity. Correspondingly, cortisol infusion decreased ammonia excretion 2.5-fold, a change that was accompanied by reduced branchial expression of all toadfish Rh isoforms (Rhag, Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2) and a twofold increase in hepatic GS activity. In contrast, maintenance of high circulating ammonia levels by ammonia infusion enhanced ammonia excretion and Rh expression (Rhag, Rhbg and Rhcg2). Toadfish treated with cortisol showed an attenuated response to ammonia infusion with no change in Rh mRNA expression or GS activity. In summary, the evidence suggests that ammonia excretion in toadfish is modulated by cortisol-induced changes in both Rh glycoprotein expression and GS activity."},{"title":"The effects of asymmetric length trajectories on the initial mechanical efficiency of mouse soleus muscles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/324","abstract":"Asymmetric cycles with more than half of the cycle spent shortening enhance the mechanical power output of muscle during flight and vocalisation. However, strategies that enhance muscle mechanical power output often compromise efficiency. In order to establish whether a trade-off necessarily exists between power and efficiency, we investigated the effects of asymmetric muscle length trajectories on the maximal mechanical cycle-average power output and initial mechanical efficiency (Ei). Work and heat were measured in vitro in a mouse soleus muscle undergoing contraction cycles with 25% (Saw25%), 50% (Saw50%) and 75% (Saw75%) of the cycles spent shortening. Cycle-average power output tended to increase with the proportion of the cycle spent shortening at a given frequency. Maximum cycle-average power output was 102.9±7.6 W kg–1 for Saw75% cycles at 5 Hz. Ei was very similar for Saw50% and Saw75% cycles at all frequencies (approximately 0.27 at 5 Hz). Saw25% cycles had Ei values similar to those of Saw50% and Saw75% cycles at 1 Hz (approximately 0.20), but were much less efficient at 5 Hz (0.08±0.03). The lower initial mechanical efficiency of Saw25% cycles at higher frequencies suggests that initial mechanical efficiency is reduced if the time available for force generation and relaxation during shortening is insufficient. The similar initial mechanical efficiency of Saw50% and Saw75% cycles at all frequencies shows that increasing the proportion of the contraction cycle spent shortening is a strategy that allows an animal to increase muscle mechanical power output without compromising initial mechanical efficiency."},{"title":"Hearing with an atympanic ear: good vibration and poor sound-pressure detection in the royal python, Python regius","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/331","abstract":"Snakes lack both an outer ear and a tympanic middle ear, which in most tetrapods provide impedance matching between the air and inner ear fluids and hence improve pressure hearing in air. Snakes would therefore be expected to have very poor pressure hearing and generally be insensitive to airborne sound, whereas the connection of the middle ear bone to the jaw bones in snakes should confer acute sensitivity to substrate vibrations. Some studies have nevertheless claimed that snakes are quite sensitive to both vibration and sound pressure. Here we test the two hypotheses that: (1) snakes are sensitive to sound pressure and (2) snakes are sensitive to vibrations, but cannot hear the sound pressure per se. Vibration and sound-pressure sensitivities were quantified by measuring brainstem evoked potentials in 11 royal pythons, Python regius. Vibrograms and audiograms showed greatest sensitivity at low frequencies of 80–160 Hz, with sensitivities of –54 dB re. 1 m s–2 and 78 dB re. 20 μPa, respectively. To investigate whether pythons detect sound pressure or sound-induced head vibrations, we measured the sound-induced head vibrations in three dimensions when snakes were exposed to sound pressure at threshold levels. In general, head vibrations induced by threshold-level sound pressure were equal to or greater than those induced by threshold-level vibrations, and therefore sound-pressure sensitivity can be explained by sound-induced head vibration. From this we conclude that pythons, and possibly all snakes, lost effective pressure hearing with the complete reduction of a functional outer and middle ear, but have an acute vibration sensitivity that may be used for communication and detection of predators and prey."},{"title":"Mechanisms of colour adaptation in the prawn Penaeus monodon","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/343","abstract":"Exposure of prawns to dark- or light-coloured substrates is known to trigger a strong colour adaptation response through expansion or contraction of the colouration structures in the prawn hypodermis. Despite the difference in colour triggered by this adaptive response, total levels of the predominant carotenoid pigment, astaxanthin, are not modified, suggesting that another mechanism is regulating this phenomenon. Astaxanthin binds to a specific protein called crustacyanin (CRCN), and it is the interaction between the quantities of each of these compounds that produces the diverse range of colours seen in crustacean shells. In this study, we investigated the protein changes and genetic regulatory processes that occur in prawn hypodermal tissues during adaptation to black or white substrates. The amount of free astaxanthin was higher in animals adapted to dark substrate compared with those adapted to light substrate, and this difference was matched by a strong elevation of CRCN protein. However, there was no difference in the expression of CRCN genes either across the moult cycle or in response to background substrate colour. These results indicate that exposure to a dark-coloured substrate causes an accumulation of CRCN protein, bound with free astaxanthin, in the prawn hypodermis without modification of CRCN gene expression. On light-coloured substrates, levels of CRCN protein in the hypodermis are reduced, but the carotenoid is retained, undispersed in the hypodermal tissue, in an esterified form. Therefore, the abundance of CRCN protein affects the distribution of pigment in prawn hypodermal tissues, and is a crucial regulator of the colour adaptation response in prawns."},{"title":"Localization of the bioadhesive precursors of the sandcastle worm, Phragmatopoma californica (Fewkes)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/351","abstract":"The marine sandcastle worm bonds mineral particles together into underwater composite dwellings with a proteinaceous glue.

Quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization demonstrated that a tyrosinase-like enzyme with a signal peptide was highly expressed in both the heterogeneous and homogeneous granules. The contents of the granules are poorly mixed in the secreted mixture that forms the glue. Subsequent covalent cross-linking of the glue may be catalyzed by the co-secreted tyrosinase.

The pumping direction of the heart regularly reverses, with a higher pulse rate during backward compared with forward pumping. A sequence of forward and backward pulse periods lasts approximately 34 s. Pulse rate, direction, velocity and the duration of heartbeat periods were determined by thermistor and electrophysiological measurements. For the first time, heartbeat-induced pressure changes were measured in the hemocoel and in the tracheal system of the thorax and the abdomen. The tracheal pressure changed from sub-atmospheric during backward heartbeat to supra-atmospheric during forward heartbeat in the thorax and inversely in the abdomen. The heartbeat reversals were coordinated with slow abdominal movements with a pumping stroke at the beginning of the forward pulse period. The pressure effect of the pumping stroke was visible only in the abdomen. Periodic hemolymph shift and abdominal movements resulted in pressure changes in the hemocoel and tracheal system alternating in the thorax and abdomen, suggesting an effect on respiratory gas exchange."},{"title":"Interplay between plasma oxidative status, cortisol and coping styles in wild alpine marmots, Marmota marmota","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/374","abstract":"Variation in how individuals cope behaviourally and physiologically with stressors is widespread and can have a significant impact on life-history traits and fitness.

Field studies on wild mammalian populations are few in number and none so far has simultaneously tested the relationship between coping style, adrenocortical reactivity and oxidative status in the same individuals. We measured individual variation in coping styles along a proactive-reactive continuum together with variation in baseline and stress-induced plasma oxidative damage, plasma non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and cortisol in wild alpine marmots, Marmota marmota. Confirmatory path analysis revealed that different coping styles are accompanied by different baseline and stress-induced plasma oxidative statuses.

The present study focused on myosin, the major protein in skeletal muscle, from adult specimens of kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus. Two types of the gene encoding myosin heavy chain (MHC), a large subunit of the myosin molecule, were cloned from abdominal fast skeletal muscle and defined as MHCa and MHCb. Protein analysis revealed that the MHCa isoform was expressed at a higher level than the MHCb isoform. The full-length cDNA clones of MHCa and MHCb consisted of 5929 bp and 5955 bp, respectively, which encoded 1912 and 1910 amino acids, respectively. Both were classified into fast muscle type by comparison with the partially deduced amino acid sequences of fast-type and slow-type (S1, slow twitch) MHCs reported previously for the American lobster Homarus americanus. The amino acid identities between MHCa and MHCb of kuruma shrimp were 78%, 60% and 72% in the regions of subfragment-1, subfragment-2 and light meromyosin, respectively, and 71% in total.

Here, we treated the aquatic predator–prey encounter as a hydrodynamic interaction between a solid particle (representing the prey) and the unsteady suction flows around it, to integrate the effects of morphology, physiology, skull kinematics, ram and fluid mechanics on suction-feeding performance. We developed the suction-induced force-field (SIFF) model to study suction-feeding performance in 18 species of centrarchid fishes, and asked what morphological and functional traits underlie the evolution of feeding performance on three types of prey. Performance gradients obtained using SIFF revealed that different trait combinations contribute to the ability to feed on attached, evasive and (strain-sensitive) zooplanktonic prey because these prey types impose different challenges on the predator. The low overlap in the importance of different traits in determining performance also indicated that the evolution of suction-feeding ability along different ecological axes is largely unconstrained. SIFF also yielded estimates of feeding ability that performed better than kinematic traits in explaining natural patterns of prey use. When compared with principal components describing variation in the kinematics of suction-feeding events, SIFF output explained significantly more variation in centrarchid diets, suggesting that the inclusion of more mechanistic hydrodynamic models holds promise for gaining insight into the evolution of aquatic feeding performance."},{"title":"Oxygen utilization and the branchial pressure gradient during ram ventilation of the shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus: is lamnid shark–tuna convergence constrained by elasmobranch gill morphology?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/22","abstract":"Ram ventilation and gill function in a lamnid shark, the shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus, were studied to assess how gill structure may affect the lamnid–tuna convergence for high-performance swimming. Despite differences in mako and tuna gill morphology, mouth gape and basal swimming speeds, measurements of mako O2 utilization at the gills (53.4±4.2%) and the pressure gradient driving branchial flow (96.8±26.1 Pa at a mean swimming speed of 38.8±5.8 cm s–1) are similar to values reported for tunas. Also comparable to tunas are estimates of the velocity (0.22±0.03 cm s–1) and residence time (0.79±0.14 s) of water though the interlamellar channels of the mako gill. However, mako and tuna gills differ in the sites of primary branchial resistance. In the mako, approximately 80% of the total branchial resistance resides in the septal channels, structures inherent to the elasmobranch gill that are not present in tunas. The added resistance at this location is compensated by a correspondingly lower resistance at the gill lamellae accomplished through wider interlamellar channels. Although greater interlamellar spacing minimizes branchial resistance, it also limits lamellar number and results in a lower total gill surface area for the mako relative to tunas. The morphology of the elasmobranch gill thus appears to constrain gill area and, consequently, limit mako aerobic performance to less than that of tunas."},{"title":"Interactive effects of salinity and elevated CO2 levels on juvenile eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/29","abstract":"Rising levels of atmospheric CO2 lead to acidification of the ocean and alter seawater carbonate chemistry, which can negatively impact calcifying organisms, including mollusks. In estuaries, exposure to elevated CO2 levels often co-occurs with other stressors, such as reduced salinity, which enhances the acidification trend, affects ion and acid–base regulation of estuarine calcifiers and modifies their response to ocean acidification. We studied the interactive effects of salinity and partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) on biomineralization and energy homeostasis in juveniles of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, a common estuarine bivalve. Juveniles were exposed for 11 weeks to one of two environmentally relevant salinities (30 or 15 PSU) either at current atmospheric PCO2 (∼400 μatm, normocapnia) or PCO2 projected by moderate IPCC scenarios for the year 2100 (∼700–800 μatm, hypercapnia). Exposure of the juvenile oysters to elevated PCO2 and/or low salinity led to a significant increase in mortality, reduction of tissue energy stores (glycogen and lipid) and negative soft tissue growth, indicating energy deficiency. Interestingly, tissue ATP levels were not affected by exposure to changing salinity and PCO2, suggesting that juvenile oysters maintain their cellular energy status at the expense of lipid and glycogen stores. At the same time, no compensatory upregulation of carbonic anhydrase activity was found under the conditions of low salinity and high PCO2. Metabolic profiling using magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed altered metabolite status following low salinity exposure; specifically, acetate levels were lower in hypercapnic than in normocapnic individuals at low salinity. Combined exposure to hypercapnia and low salinity negatively affected mechanical properties of shells of the juveniles, resulting in reduced hardness and fracture resistance. Thus, our data suggest that the combined effects of elevated PCO2 and fluctuating salinity may jeopardize the survival of eastern oysters because of weakening of their shells and increased energy consumption."},{"title":"A robotic fish caudal fin: effects of stiffness and motor program on locomotor performance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/56","abstract":"We designed a robotic fish caudal fin with six individually moveable fin rays based on the tail of the bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus. Previous fish robotic tail designs have loosely resembled the caudal fin of fishes, but have not incorporated key biomechanical components such as fin rays that can be controlled to generate complex tail conformations and motion programs similar to those seen in the locomotor repertoire of live fishes. We used this robotic caudal fin to test for the effects of fin ray stiffness, frequency and motion program on the generation of thrust and lift forces. Five different sets of fin rays were constructed to be from 150 to 2000 times the stiffness of biological fin rays, appropriately scaled for the robotic caudal fin, which had linear dimensions approximately four times larger than those of adult bluegill sunfish. Five caudal fin motion programs were identified as kinematic features of swimming behaviors in live bluegill sunfish, and were used to program the kinematic repertoire: flat movement of the entire fin, cupping of the fin, W-shaped fin motion, fin undulation and rolling movements. The robotic fin was flapped at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 Hz. All fin motions produced force in the thrust direction, and the cupping motion produced the most thrust in almost all cases. Only the undulatory motion produced lift force of similar magnitude to the thrust force. More compliant fin rays produced lower peak magnitude forces than the stiffer fin rays at the same frequency. Thrust and lift forces increased with increasing flapping frequency; thrust was maximized by the 500× stiffness fin rays and lift was maximized by the 1000× stiffness fin rays."},{"title":"Ants might use different view-matching strategies on and off the route","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/44","abstract":"Individual foraging ants are known to rely on views of their surroundings for route learning and for pinpointing goals. Different strategies have been proposed to explain how ants might process visual information for navigation, but little is known about the actual development and nature of the view-based strategies used by ants in complex natural environments. Here, we constrained the knowledge of Melophorus bagoti ants to either the nest vicinity or a curved route (length 10 m) and analysed their initial direction when released at both novel and familiar locations. In parallel, we used 360 deg pictures of the scene as a basis for modelling different navigational strategies. We propose here a new hypothesis based on skyline height comparison to explain how ants home from novel locations. Interestingly, this strategy succeeded well at novel locations but failed on familiar terrain. By contrast, the use of a visual compass strategy failed at novel locations but could explain the results on familiar routes. We suggest that ants might switch between skyline height comparison and a visual compass strategy, depending on whether they are on familiar terrain or not. How ants could switch between strategies and how their memories develop are discussed in turn."},{"title":"Contextual chemosensory urine signaling in an African cichlid fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/68","abstract":"Chemosensory signaling is crucial for communication in many fish species, but little is known about how signalers modulate chemical output in response to sensory information and social context. Here, we tested the hypothesis that dominant male African cichlid fish (Astatotilapia burtoni) use urine signals during social interactions, and demonstrate that this signaling depends on social context (reproductive; territorial) and on available sensory information (visual cues; full interaction). We injected males with dye to visualize urine pulses and exposed them to full sensory information or visual cues alone of four types: (1) dominant male; (2) gravid (reproductively receptive) females; (3) mouth-brooding (non-receptive) females; or (4) control (no fish). We found that males released urine sooner and increased their urination frequency when visually exposed to gravid females as compared with mouth-brooding females and or no-fish controls. While males could distinguish female reproductive states using visual cues alone, courtship behavior rates were ∼10-fold higher when they fully interacted with gravid females compared with receiving visual cues alone. Males also increased their urination and territorial behaviors when exposed to another male, suggesting that chemical signals may convey information on dominance status. These data support the hypothesis that dominant males use urine as a chemical signal and adjust the frequency of their urine output based on contextual information."},{"title":"An analysis of the rebound of the body in backward human running","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/75","abstract":"Step frequency and energy expenditure are greater in backward running than in forward running. The differences in the motion of the centre of mass of the body associated with these findings are not known. These differences were measured here on nine trained subjects during backward and forward running steps on a force platform at 3–17 km h–1. In contrast to previous reports, we found that the maximal upward acceleration of the centre of mass and the aerial phase, averaged over the whole speed range, are greater in backward running than in forward running (15.7 versus 13.2 m s–2, P=1.9×10–6 and 0.098 versus 0.072 s, P=2.4×10–5, respectively). Opposite to forward running, the impulse on the ground is directed more vertically during the push at the end of stance than during the brake at the beginning of stance. The higher step frequency in backward running is explained by a greater mass-specific vertical stiffness of the bouncing system (499 versus 352 s–2, P=2.3×10–11) resulting in a shorter duration of the lower part of the vertical oscillation of the centre of mass when the force is greater than body weight, with a similar duration of the upper part when the force is lower than body weight. As in a catapult, muscle–tendon units are stretched more slowly during the brake at the beginning of stance and shorten more rapidly during the push at the end of stance. We suggest that the catapult-like mechanism of backward running, although requiring greater energy expenditure and not providing a smoother ride, may allow a safer stretch–shorten cycle of muscle–tendon units."},{"title":"Vocal tract articulation revisited: the case of the monk parakeet","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/85","abstract":"Birdsong and human speech share many features with respect to vocal learning and development. However, the vocal production mechanisms have long been considered to be distinct. The vocal organ of songbirds is more complex than the human larynx, leading to the hypothesis that vocal variation in birdsong originates mainly at the sound source, while in humans it is primarily due to vocal tract filtering. However, several recent studies have indicated the importance of vocal tract articulators such as the beak and oropharyngeal–esophageal cavity. In contrast to most other bird groups, parrots have a prominent tongue, raising the possibility that tongue movements may also be of significant importance in vocal production in parrots, but evidence is rare and observations often anecdotal. In the current study we used X-ray cinematographic imaging of naturally vocalizing monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) to assess which articulators are possibly involved in vocal tract filtering in this species. We observed prominent tongue height changes, beak opening movements and tracheal length changes, which suggests that all of these components play an important role in modulating vocal tract resonance. Moreover, the observation of tracheal shortening as a vocal articulator in live birds has to our knowledge not been described before. We also found strong positive correlations between beak opening and amplitude as well as changes in tongue height and amplitude in several types of vocalization. Our results suggest considerable differences between parrot and songbird vocal production while at the same time the parrot's vocal articulation might more closely resemble human speech production in the sense that both make extensive use of the tongue as a vocal articulator."},{"title":"Hypoxia tolerance in elasmobranchs. I. Critical oxygen tension as a measure of blood oxygen transport during hypoxia exposure","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/93","abstract":"The critical O2 tension of whole-animal O2 consumption rate (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/215/1/93/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>), or Pcrit, is the water PO2 (PwO2) at which an animal transitions from an oxyregulator to an oxyconformer. Although Pcrit is a popular measure of hypoxia tolerance in fishes because it reflects the capacity for O2 uptake from the environment at low PwO2, little is known about the interrelationships between Pcrit and blood O2 transport characteristics and increased use of anaerobic metabolism during hypoxia exposure in fishes, especially elasmobranchs. We addressed this knowledge gap using progressive hypoxia exposures of two elasmobranch species with differing hypoxia tolerance. The Pcrit of the hypoxia-tolerant epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum, 5.10±0.37 kPa) was significantly lower than that of the comparatively hypoxia-sensitive shovelnose ray (Aptychotrema rostrata, 7.23±0.40 kPa). Plasma [lactate] was elevated above normoxic values at around Pcrit in epaulette sharks, but increased relative to normoxic values at PwO2 below Pcrit in shovelnose rays, providing equivocal support for the hypothesis that Pcrit is associated with increased anaerobic metabolism. The <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/215/1/93/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/>, arterial PO2 and arterial blood O2 content (CaO2) were similar between the two species under normoxia and decreased in both species with progressive hypoxia, but as PwO2 declined, epaulette sharks had a consistently higher <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/215/1/93/embed/inline-graphic-3.gif\"/> and CaO2 than shovelnose rays, probably due to their significantly greater in vivo haemoglobin (Hb)–O2 binding affinity (in vivo Hb–O2 P50=4.27±0.57 kPa for epaulette sharks vs 6.35±0.34 kPa for shovelnose rays). However, at PwO2 values representing the same percentage of each species' Pcrit (up to ∼175% of Pcrit), Hb–O2 saturation and CaO2 were similar between species. These data support the hypothesis that Hb–O2 P50 is an important determinant of Pcrit and suggest that Pcrit can predict Hb–O2 saturation and CaO2 during hypoxia exposure, with a lower Pcrit being associated with greater O2 supply at a given PwO2 and consequently better hypoxia tolerance. Thus, Pcrit is a valuable predictor of environmental hypoxia tolerance and hypoxia exposures standardized at a given percentage of Pcrit will yield comparable levels of arterial hypoxaemia, facilitating cross-species comparisons of responses to hypoxia."},{"title":"Hypoxia tolerance in elasmobranchs. II. Cardiovascular function and tissue metabolic responses during progressive and relative hypoxia exposures","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/103","abstract":"Cardiovascular function and metabolic responses of the heart and other tissues during hypoxia exposure were compared between the hypoxia-tolerant epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) and the hypoxia-sensitive shovelnose ray (Aptychotrema rostrata). In both species, progressive hypoxia exposure caused increases in stroke volume and decreases in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac power output (CPO, an assessment of cardiac energy demand) and dorsal aortic blood pressure, all of which occurred at or below each species' critical PO2 for whole-animal O2 consumption rate, <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/215/1/103/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/> (Pcrit). In epaulette sharks, which have a lower Pcrit than shovelnose rays, routine levels of cardiovascular function were maintained to lower water PO2 levels and the changes from routine levels during hypoxia exposure were smaller compared with those for the shovelnose ray. The maintenance rather than depression of cardiovascular function during hypoxia exposure may contribute to the superior hypoxia tolerance of the epaulette shark, presumably by improving O2 delivery and waste removal. Compared with shovelnose rays, epaulette sharks were also better able to maintain a stable cardiac high-energy phosphate pool and to minimize metabolic acidosis and lactate accumulation in the heart (despite higher CPO) and other tissues during a 4 h exposure to 40% of their respective Pcrit (referred to as a relative hypoxia exposure), which results in similar hypoxaemia in the two species (∼16% Hb–O2 saturation). These different metabolic responses to relative hypoxia exposure suggest that variation in hypoxia tolerance among species is not solely dictated by differences in O2 uptake and transport but also by tissue-specific metabolic responses. In particular, lower tissue [lactate] accumulation in epaulette sharks than in shovelnose rays during relative hypoxia exposure suggests that enhanced extra-cardiac metabolic depression occurs in the former species. This could facilitate strategic utilization of available O2 for vital organs such as the heart, potentially explaining the greater hypoxic cardiovascular function of epaulette sharks."},{"title":"Electromyography of wrist and finger flexor muscles in olive baboons (Papio anubis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/115","abstract":"Some non-human primates use digitigrade hand postures when walking slowly on the ground. As a component of an extended limb, a digitigrade posture can help minimize wrist joint moments thereby requiring little force production directly from wrist flexors (and/or from the assistance of finger flexors) to maintain limb posture. As a consequence, less active muscle volume would be required from these anti-gravity muscles and overall metabolic costs associated with locomotion could be reduced. To investigate whether the use of digitigrade hand postures during walking in primates entails minimal use of anti-gravity muscles, this study examined electromyography (EMG) patterns in both the wrist and finger flexor muscles in facultatively digitigrade olive baboons (Papio anubis) across a range of speeds. The results demonstrate that baboons can adopt a digitigrade hand posture when standing and moving at slow speeds without requiring substantial EMG activity from distal anti-gravity muscles. Higher speed locomotion, however, entails increasing EMG activity and is accompanied by a dynamic shift to a more palmigrade-like limb posture. Thus, the ability to adopt a digitigrade hand posture by monkeys is an adaptation for ground living, but it was never co-opted for fast locomotion. Rather, digitigrady in primates appears to be related to energetic efficiency for walking long distances."},{"title":"Point of no return in diving emperor penguins: is the timing of the decision to return limited by the number of strokes?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/135","abstract":"At some point in a dive, breath-hold divers must decide to return to the surface to breathe. The issue of when to end a dive has been discussed intensively in terms of foraging ecology and behavioral physiology, using dive duration as a temporal parameter. Inevitably, however, a time lag exists between the decision of animals to start returning to the surface and the end of the dive, especially in deep dives. In the present study, we examined the decision time in emperor penguins under two different conditions: during foraging trips at sea and during dives at an artificial isolated dive hole. It was found that there was an upper limit for the decision-to-return time irrespective of dive depth in birds diving at sea. However, in a large proportion of dives at the isolated dive hole, the decision-to-return time exceeded the upper limit at sea. This difference between the decision times in dives at sea versus the isolated dive hole was accounted for by a difference in stroke rate. The stroke rates were much lower in dives at the isolated hole and were inversely correlated with the upper limit of decision times in individual birds. Unlike the decision time to start returning, the cumulative number of strokes at the decision time fell within a similar range in the two experiments. This finding suggests that the number of strokes, but not elapsed time, constrained the decision of emperor penguins to return to the surface. While the decision to return and to end a dive may be determined by a variety of ecological, behavioral and physiological factors, the upper limit to that decision time may be related to cumulative muscle workload."},{"title":"Regulation of behaviorally associated gene networks in worker honey bee ovaries","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/124","abstract":"Several lines of evidence support genetic links between ovary size and division of labor in worker honey bees. However, it is largely unknown how ovaries influence behavior. To address this question, we first performed transcriptional profiling on worker ovaries from two genotypes that differ in social behavior and ovary size. Then, we contrasted the differentially expressed ovarian genes with six sets of available brain transcriptomes. Finally, we probed behavior-related candidate gene networks in wild-type ovaries of different sizes. We found differential expression in 2151 ovarian transcripts in these artificially selected honey bee strains, corresponding to approximately 20.3% of the predicted gene set of honey bees. Differences in gene expression overlapped significantly with changes in the brain transcriptomes. Differentially expressed genes were associated with neural signal transmission (tyramine receptor, TYR) and ecdysteroid signaling; two independently tested nuclear hormone receptors (HR46 and ftz-f1) were also significantly correlated with ovary size in wild-type bees. We suggest that the correspondence between ovary and brain transcriptomes identified here indicates systemic regulatory networks among hormones (juvenile hormone and ecdysteroids), pheromones (queen mandibular pheromone), reproductive organs and nervous tissues in worker honey bees. Furthermore, robust correlations between ovary size and neuraland endocrine response genes are consistent with the hypothesized roles of the ovaries in honey bee behavioral regulation."},{"title":"Earliest ciliary swimming effects vertical transport of planktonic embryos in turbulence and shear flow","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/141","abstract":"Eggs released by broadcast-spawning marine invertebrates are often negatively buoyant. Blastulae and gastrulae of these species are commonly motile, with passive stability that leads to upward swimming in still water. The earliest occurrence of swimming in developing embryos of diverse invertebrates may therefore permit vertical migration in nature. I used turbulent and laminar shear flows to investigate: (1) the speed and direction of transport of non-motile and newly swimming stages of the echinoids Dendraster excentricus and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus in turbulence, and (2) the limit of stable vertical orientation in swimming blastulae of D. excentricus. Swimming contributed significantly to the rate of upward transport of D. excentricus in turbulence experiments where the kinetic energy dissipation rate (ε) was ∼10–2cm2s–3. However, swimming significantly reduced the rate of upward transport of S. purpuratus blastulae in turbulence, suggesting that passively stable swimmers of this species were turned from the vertical, crossed flow-lines, and migrated into downwelling. Observations of swimming in laminar shear indicate that D. excentricus swimming blastulae maintain a vertical orientation until shear approaches 0.26s–1, equivalent to sub-microscale shear in turbulence where ε is ∼10–3cm2s–3. Swimming speeds of D. excentricus showed an unexpected dependence on shear, indicating that greater shear (within limits) can enhance speed of ciliary swimming. In D. excentricus, swimming by newly hatched blastulae should support upward migration in turbulence characteristic of coastal surface waters, whereas species differences in passive stability and swimming responses to shear may lead to differences in vertical transport and subsequent dispersal."},{"title":"Local acoustic particle motion guides sound-source localization behavior in the plainfin midshipman fish, Porichthys notatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/152","abstract":"Sound-source localization behavior was studied in the plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) by making use of the naturally occurring phonotaxis response of gravid females to playback of the male's advertisement call. The observations took place outdoors in a circular concrete tank. A dipole sound projector was placed at the center of the tank and an 80–90 Hz tone (the approximate fundamental frequency to the male's advertisement call) was broadcast to gravid females that were released from alternative sites approximately 100 cm from the source. The phonotaxic responses of females to the source were recorded, analyzed and compared with the sound field. One release site was approximately along the vibratory axis of the dipole source, and the other was approximately orthogonal to the vibratory axis. The sound field in the tank was fully characterized through measurements of the sound pressure field using hydrophones and acoustic particle motion using an accelerometer. These measurements confirmed that the sound field was a nearly ideal dipole. When released along the dipole vibratory axis, the responding female fish took essentially straight paths to the source. However, when released approximately 90 deg to the source's vibratory axis, the responding females took highly curved paths to the source that were approximately in line with the local particle motion axes. These results indicate that the acoustic cues used by fish during sound-source localization include the axes of particle motion of the local sound field."},{"title":"Surface roughness effects on attachment ability of the spider Philodromus dispar (Araneae, Philodromidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/179","abstract":"The morphology of the tarsal attachment system of the running spider Philodromus dispar Walckenaer 1826 (Araneae, Philodomidae) was studied using scanning electron microscopy and its performance was experimentally tested in traction force measurements.

Microtrichia carry spatulate end tips that allow close contact with the substrate. Forces were estimated on tethered living specimens on rough epoxy resin surfaces (asperity size 0.3, 1, 3, 9 and 12 μm) and on a smooth surface as a control. A strong reduction in adhesion was observed for substrates with an asperity size of 0.3 and 1 μm. Comparison of the present data with previous results of different organisms demonstrates that the difference in force reduction on rough substrata depends on the dimensions of terminal contact elements (spatulae)."},{"title":"The energetics of running stability: costs of transport in grass-cutting ants depend on fragment shape","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/161","abstract":"Grass-cutting ants (Atta vollenweideri) carry fragments that can be many times heavier and longer than the ants themselves and it is important for them to avoid falling over during load transport. To investigate whether the energetic costs of transport are affected by the need to maintain stability, the rate of CO2 production was measured in both unladen workers and workers carrying standardized paper fragments of different size and shape. We tested: (1) the effect of mass by comparing workers carrying either light or heavy fragments of the same size, and (2) the effect of shape by comparing short and long fragments of the same mass. Consistent with previous studies, metabolic rate increased but running speed remained constant when ants carried heavier fragments. The net cost of transport (normalized to the total mass of ant and fragment) was the same for heavy and light fragments, and did not differ from the costs of carrying a unit body mass. Ants carrying long fragments showed similar metabolic rates but ran significantly slower than ants carrying short fragments. As a consequence, net cost of transport was significantly higher for long fragments than for short ones, and higher than the costs of carrying a unit body mass. The observed reduction in running speed is likely a result of the ants' need to maintain stability. When the absolute costs of transport were compared, smaller ants required more energy to carry heavier and longer fragments than larger workers, but the opposite was found for lighter and shorter fragments. The absolute costs of transport per unit fragment mass suggest that it is energetically advantageous for a colony to allocate smaller workers for the transport of small fragments and larger workers for large fragments. The present results underline the importance of biomechanical factors for the understanding of leaf-cutting ant foraging strategies."},{"title":"High levels of dietary fat impair glucose homeostasis in rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/169","abstract":"This study was designed to assess the effects of dietary fat levels on glucose homeostasis in rainbow trout under prolonged hyperglycaemia induced by high carbohydrate intake. Trout were fed identical amounts of one of two iso-energetic diets containing either a low (LFD, 3%) or a high fat level (HFD, 20%) and similar amounts of digestible carbohydrates (26–30%) for 14 days. While a single high fat meal reduced glycaemia compared with a low fat meal, the consumption of a high fat diet for 14 days resulted in prolonged hypergylcaemia and reduced plasma glucose clearance in response to an exogenous glucose or insulin challenge. The hyperglycaemic phenotype in trout was characterised by a reduction of the activities of lipogenic and glucose phosphorylating enzymes with a concomitant stimulation of enzymes involved in glucose production in the liver and reduced glycogen levels in the white muscle. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was further associated with a significant reduction of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein content in muscle, and with a poor response of HFD fed fish to an exogenous insulin load, suggestive of impaired insulin signalling in trout fed with a HFD. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that a teleost can also develop a high fat-induced IGT, characterised by persistent hyperglycaemia and reduced insulin sensitivity, established symptoms of IGT and the prediabetic insulin-resistant state in mammals. Our results also provide evidence that persistent hyperglycaemia after a high carbohydrate meal stems from a metabolic interaction between dietary macronutrients rather than from high carbohydrate intake alone."},{"title":"Selected regulation of gastrointestinal acid–base secretion and tissue metabolism for the diamondback water snake and Burmese python","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/1/185","abstract":"Snakes exhibit an apparent dichotomy in the regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) performance with feeding and fasting; frequently feeding species modestly regulate intestinal function whereas infrequently feeding species rapidly upregulate and downregulate intestinal function with the start and completion of each meal, respectively. The downregulatory response with fasting for infrequently feeding snakes is hypothesized to be a selective attribute that reduces energy expenditure between meals. To ascertain the links between feeding habit, whole-animal metabolism, and GI function and metabolism, we measured preprandial and postprandial metabolic rates and gastric and intestinal acid–base secretion, epithelial conductance and oxygen consumption for the frequently feeding diamondback water snake (Nerodia rhombifer) and the infrequently feeding Burmese python (Python molurus). Independent of body mass, Burmese pythons possess a significantly lower standard metabolic rate and respond to feeding with a much larger metabolic response compared with water snakes. While fasting, pythons cease gastric acid and intestinal base secretion, both of which are stimulated with feeding. In contrast, fasted water snakes secreted gastric acid and intestinal base at rates similar to those of digesting snakes. We observed no difference between fasted and fed individuals for either species in gastric or intestinal transepithelial potential and conductance, with the exception of a significantly greater gastric transepithelial potential for fed pythons at the start of titration. Water snakes experienced no significant change in gastric or intestinal metabolism with feeding. Fed pythons, in contrast, experienced a near-doubling of gastric metabolism and a tripling of intestinal metabolic rate. For fasted individuals, the metabolic rate of the stomach and small intestine was significantly lower for pythons than for water snakes. The fasting downregulation of digestive function for pythons is manifested in a depressed gastric and intestinal metabolism, which selectively serves to reduce basal metabolism and hence promote survival between infrequent meals. By maintaining elevated GI performance between meals, fasted water snakes incur the additional cost of tissue activity, which is expressed in a higher standard metabolic rate."},{"title":"Activity of extrinsic limb muscles in dogs at walk, trot and gallop","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/2/287","abstract":"The extrinsic limb muscles perform locomotor work and must adapt their activity to changes in gait and locomotor speed, which can alter the work performed by, and forces transmitted across, the proximal fulcra of the limbs where these muscles operate.

Muscle activity indicates that the basic functions of the extrinsic limb muscles – protraction, retraction and trunk support – are conserved among gaits. The forelimb retains its strut-like behavior in all gaits, as indicated by both the relative inactivity of the retractor muscles (e.g. the pectoralis profundus and the latissimus dorsi) during stance and the protractor muscles (e.g. the pectoralis superficialis and the omotransversarius) in the first half of stance. The hindlimb functions as a propulsive lever in all gaits, as revealed by the similar timing of activity of retractors (e.g. the biceps femoris and the gluteus medius) during stance. Excitation increased in many hindlimb muscles in the order walk–trot–gallop, consistent with greater propulsive impulses in faster gaits. Many forelimb muscles, in contrast, showed the greatest excitation at trot, in accord with a shorter limb oscillation period, greater locomotor work performed by the forelimb and presumably greater absorption of collisional energy."},{"title":"Terrestrial feeding in aquatic turtles: environment-dependent feeding behavior modulation and the evolution of terrestrial feeding in Emydidae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4083","abstract":"Evolutionary transitions between aquatic and terrestrial environments are common in vertebrate evolution.

A comparison of feeding in both aquatic and terrestrial environments presents an excellent opportunity to investigate the evolution of terrestrial feeding from aquatic feeding, as well as a system within which to develop methods for studying major evolutionary transitions between environments. Individuals from eight species of emydid turtles (six aquatic, two terrestrial) were filmed while feeding underwater and on land. Bite kinematics were analyzed to determine whether aquatic turtles modulated their feeding behavior in a consistent and appropriate manner between environments. Aquatic turtles showed consistent changes between environments, taking longer bites and using more extensive motions of the jaw and hyoid when feeding on land. However, these motions differ from those shown by species that naturally feed in both environments and mostly do not seem to be appropriate for terrestrial feeding. For example, more extensive motions of the hyoid are only effective during underwater suction feeding. Emydids evolving to feed on land probably would have needed to evolve or learn to overcome many, but not all, aspects of the intrinsic emydid response to terrestrial feeding. Studies that investigate major evolutionary transitions must determine what responses to the new environment are shown by naïve individuals in order to fully understand the evolutionary patterns and processes associated with these transitions."},{"title":"Induced and constitutive responses of digestive enzymes to plant toxins in an herbivorous mammal","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4133","abstract":"Many plants produce plant secondary compounds (PSCs) that bind and inhibit the digestive enzymes of herbivores, thus limiting digestibility for the herbivore. Herbivorous insects employ several physiological responses to overcome the anti-nutritive effects of PSCs. However, studies in vertebrates have not shown such responses, perhaps stemming from the fact that previously studied vertebrates were not herbivorous. The responses of the digestive system to dietary PSCs in populations of Bryant's woodrat (Neotoma bryanti) that vary in their ecological and evolutionary experience with the PSCs in creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) were compared. Individuals from naïve and experienced populations were fed diets with and without added creosote resin. Animals fed diets with creosote resin had higher activities of pancreatic amylase, as well as luminal amylase and chymotrypsin, regardless of prior experience with creosote. The experienced population showed constitutively higher activities of intestinal maltase and sucrase. Additionally, the naïve population produced an aminopeptidase-N enzyme that was less inhibited by creosote resin when feeding on the creosote resin diet, whereas the experienced population constitutively expressed this form of aminopeptidase-N. Thus, the digestive system of an herbivorous vertebrate responds significantly to dietary PSCs, which may be important for allowing herbivorous vertebrates to feed on PSC-rich diets."},{"title":"Energetic constraints on electric signalling in wave-type weakly electric fishes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4141","abstract":"Gymnotiform weakly electric fishes generate electric organ discharges (EODs) and sense perturbations of the resulting electric field for purposes of orientation, prey detection and communication. Some species produce oscillatory (‘wave-type’) EODs at very high frequencies (up to 2 kHz) that have been proposed to be energetically expensive. If high-frequency EODs are expensive, then fish may modulate their EOD frequency and/or amplitude in response to low-oxygen (hypoxic) stress and/or compensate for costs of signalling through other adaptations that maximize oxygen uptake efficiency. To test for evidence of an energetic cost of signalling, we recorded EOD in conjunction with metabolic rates, critical oxygen tension and aquatic surface respiration (ASR90) thresholds in Apteronotus leptorhynchus, a species found in high-oxygen habitats, and Eigenmannia virescens, a species more typically found in low-oxygen waters. Eigenmannia virescens had a lower mean ASR90 threshold and critical oxygen tension compared with A. leptorhynchus, consistent with field distributions. Within each species, there was no evidence for a relationship between metabolic rate and either EOD frequency or amplitude under normoxia, suggesting that there is no significant direct metabolic cost associated with producing a higher frequency EOD. However, when exposed to progressive hypoxia, fish generally responded by reducing EOD amplitude, which may reduce energetic costs. The threshold at which fish reduced EOD amplitude tended to be lower in E. virescens, a pattern consistent with higher tolerance to hypoxic stress. The results of this study suggest that wave-type fish reduce their EOD amplitude to reduce direct energetic costs without reducing metabolic rate under hypoxia."},{"title":"The role of vision in odor-plume tracking by walking and flying insects","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4121","abstract":"The walking paths of male cockroaches, Periplaneta americana, tracking point-source plumes of female pheromone often appear similar in structure to those observed from flying male moths. Flying moths use visual-flow-field feedback of their movements to control steering and speed over the ground and to detect the wind speed and direction while tracking plumes of odors. Walking insects are also known to use flow field cues to steer their trajectories. Can the upwind steering we observe in plume-tracking walking male cockroaches be explained by visual-flow-field feedback, as in flying moths? To answer this question, we experimentally occluded the compound eyes and ocelli of virgin P. americana males, separately and in combination, and challenged them with different wind and odor environments in our laboratory wind tunnel. They were observed responding to: (1) still air and no odor, (2) wind and no odor, (3) a wind-borne point-source pheromone plume and (4) a wide pheromone plume in wind. If walking cockroaches require visual cues to control their steering with respect to their environment, we would expect their tracks to be less directed and more variable if they cannot see. Instead, we found few statistically significant differences among behaviors exhibited by intact control cockroaches or those with their eyes occluded, under any of our environmental conditions. Working towards our goal of a comprehensive understanding of chemo-orientation in insects, we then challenged flying and walking male moths to track pheromone plumes with and without visual feedback. Neither walking nor flying moths performed as well as walking cockroaches when there was no visual information available."},{"title":"The relationship between NMDA receptor function and the high ammonia tolerance of anoxia-tolerant goldfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4107","abstract":"Acute ammonia toxicity in vertebrates is thought to be characterized by a cascade of deleterious events resembling those associated with anoxic/ischemic injury in the central nervous system. A key event is the over-stimulation of neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which leads to excitotoxic cell death. The similarity between the responses to acute ammonia toxicity and anoxia suggests that anoxia-tolerant animals such as the goldfish (Carassius auratus Linnaeus) may also be ammonia tolerant. To test this hypothesis, the responses of goldfish were compared with those of the anoxia-sensitive rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) during exposure to high external ammonia (HEA). Acute toxicity tests revealed that goldfish are ammonia tolerant, with 96 h median lethal concentration (LC50) values of 199 μmol l–1 and 4132 μmol l–1 for NH3 and total ammonia ([TAmm]=[NH3]+[NH4+]), respectively. These values were ∼5–6 times greater than corresponding NH3 and TAmm LC50 values measured in rainbow trout. Further, the goldfish readily coped with chronic exposure to NH4Cl (3–5 mmol l–1) for 5 days, despite 6-fold increases in plasma [T] to ∼1300 μmol l–1 and 3-fold increases in brain [TAmm] to 6700 μmol l–1. Muscle [TAmm] increased by almost 8-fold from ∼900 μmol kg–1 wet mass (WM) to greater than 7000 μmol kg–1 WM by 48 h, and stabilized. Although urea excretion rates (JUrea) increased by 2–3-fold during HEA, the increases were insufficient to offset the inhibition of ammonia excretion that occurred, and increases in urea were not observed in the brain or muscle. There was a marked increase in brain glutamine concentration at HEA, from ∼3000 μmol kg–1 WM to 15,000 μmol kg–1 WM after 48 h, which is consistent with the hypothesis that glutamine production is associated with ammonia detoxification. Injection of the NMDA receptor antagonists MK801 (0.5–8 mg kg–1) or ethanol (1–8 mg kg–1) increased trout survival time by 1.5–2.0-fold during exposure to 2 mmol l–1 ammonia, suggesting that excitotoxic cell death contributes to ammonia toxicity in this species. In contrast, similar doses of MK801 or ethanol had no effect on ammonia-challenged (8–9.5 mmol l–1 TAmm) goldfish survival times, suggesting that greater resistance to excitotoxic cell death contributes to the high ammonia-tolerance of the goldfish. Whole-cell recordings measured in isolated brain slices of goldfish telencephalon during in vitro exposure to 5 mmol l–1 or 10 mmol l–1 TAmm reversibly potentiated NMDA receptor currents. This observation suggested that goldfish neurons may not be completely resistant to ammonia-induced excitotoxicity. Subsequent western blot and densitometric analyses revealed that NMDA receptor NR1 subunit abundance was 40–60% lower in goldfish exposed to 3–5 mmol l–1 TAmm for 5 days, which was followed by a restoration of NR1 subunit abundance after 3 days recovery in ammonia-free water. We conclude that the goldfish brain may be protected from excitotoxicity by downregulating the abundance of functional NMDA receptors during periods when it experiences increased internal ammonia."},{"title":"The mechanics and control of pitching manoeuvres in a freely flying hawkmoth (Manduca sexta)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4092","abstract":"Insects produce a variety of exquisitely controlled manoeuvres during natural flight behaviour. Here we show how hawkmoths produce and control one such manoeuvre, an avoidance response consisting of rapid pitching up, rearward flight, pitching down (often past the original pitch angle), and then pitching up slowly to equilibrium. We triggered these manoeuvres via a sudden visual stimulus in front of free-flying hawkmoths (Manduca sexta) while recording the animals' body and wing movements via high-speed stereo videography. We then recreated the wing motions in a dynamically scaled model to: (1) associate wing kinematic changes with pitch torque production and (2) extract the open-loop dynamics of an uncontrolled moth. Next, we characterized the closed-loop manoeuvring dynamics from the observed flight behaviour assuming that hawkmoths use feedback control based on translational velocity, pitch angle and angular velocity, and then compared these with the open-loop dynamics to identify the control strategy used by the moth. Our analysis revealed that hawkmoths produce active pitch torque via changes in mean wing spanwise rotation angle. Additionally, body translations produce passive translational damping and pitch torque, both of which are linearly dependent on the translational velocity. Body rotations produce similar passive forces and torques, but of substantially smaller magnitudes. Our comparison of closed-loop and open-loop dynamics showed that hawkmoths rely largely on passive damping to reduce the body translation but use feedback control based on pitch angle and angular velocity to control their orientation. The resulting feedback control system remains stable with sensory delays of more than two wingbeats."},{"title":"Negative correlation between milk production and brown adipose tissue gene expression in lactating mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4160","abstract":"It has been proposed that the performance of lactating animals is limited by the capacity of the female to dissipate body heat – the heat dissipation limit (HDL) theory. This theory predicts that milk production might be constrained not by intrinsic properties of the mammary glands but rather by competitive heat production such as thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). To test this prediction, we measured the expression of genes linked to thermogenesis in BAT of lactating laboratory mice. The applicability of BAT gene expression to reflect thermogenic activity of BAT was confirmed by a positive relationship between expression levels of several BAT genes (summarised by the first principal component following principal component analysis) and daily energy expenditure in virgin mice. Milk production at peak lactation was strongly and negatively associated with the expression of thermogenic genes in BAT. Downregulation of these genes during lactation was correlated with low levels of circulating leptin and high levels of circulating prolactin. Our results are consistent with the HDL theory. However, we cannot discount the converse interpretation that milk production may reduce BAT activity. If the reduction in BAT activity does facilitate increased milk production, then reducing the heat generated by competitive processes may be a more productive route to increase lactational performance than attempts to improve mammary gland performance in isolation from the other body systems."},{"title":"Habituation under natural conditions: model predators are distinguished by approach direction","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4209","abstract":"Habituation is an active process that allows animals to learn to identify repeated, harmless events, and so could help individuals deal with the trade-off between reducing the risk of predation and minimizing escape costs. Safe habituation requires an accurate distinction between dangerous and harmless events, but in natural environments such an assessment is challenging because sensory information is often noisy and limited. What, then, comprises the information animals use to recognize objects that they have previously learned to be harmless? We tested whether the fiddler crab Uca vomeris distinguishes objects purely by their sensory signature or whether identification also involves more complex attributes such as the direction from which an object approaches. We found that crabs habituated their escape responses after repeated presentations of a dummy predator consistently approaching from the same compass direction. Females habituated both movement towards the burrow and descent into the burrow, whereas males only habituated descent into the burrow. The crabs were more likely to respond again when a physically identical dummy approached them from a new compass direction. The crabs distinguished between the two dummies even though both dummies were visible for the entire duration of the experiment and there was no difference in the timing of the dummies' movements. Thus, the position or approach direction of a dummy encodes important information that allows animals to identify an event and habituate to it. These results argue against the traditional notion that habituation is a simple, non-associative learning process, and instead suggest that habituation is very selective and uses information to distinguish between objects that is not available from the sensory signature of the object itself."},{"title":"Regulation of insulin-producing cells in the adult Drosophila brain via the tachykinin peptide receptor DTKR","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4201","abstract":"Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs) play important hormonal roles in the regulation of metabolic carbohydrates and lipids, but also in reproduction, growth, stress resistance and aging. In spite of intense studies of insulin signaling in Drosophilag the regulation of DILP production and release in adult fruit flies is poorly understood. Here we investigated the role of Drosophila tachykinin-related peptides (DTKs) and their receptors, DTKR and NKD, in the regulation of brain insulin-producing cells (IPCs) and aspects of DILP signaling. First, we show DTK-immunoreactive axon terminations close to the presumed dendrites of the IPCs, and DTKR immunolabeling in these cells. Second, we utilized targeted RNA interference to knock down expression of the DTK receptor, DTKR, in IPCs and monitored the effects on Dilp transcript levels in the brains of fed and starved flies. Dilp2 and Dilp3, but not Dilp5, transcripts were significantly affected by DTKR knockdown in IPCs, both in fed and starved flies. Both Dilp2 and Dilp3 transcripts increased in fed flies with DTKR diminished in IPCs whereas at starvation the Dilp3 transcript plummeted and Dilp2 increased. We also measured trehalose and lipid levels as well as survival in transgene flies at starvation. Knockdown of DTKR in IPCs leads to increased lifespan and a faster decrease of trehalose at starvation but has no significant effect on lipid levels. Finally, we targeted the IPCs with RNAi or ectopic expression of the other DTK receptor, NKD, but found no effect on survival at starvation. Our results suggest that DTK signaling, via DTKR, regulates the brain IPCs."},{"title":"Experience influences elemental and configural perception of certain binary odour mixtures in newborn rabbits","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4171","abstract":"Elemental and configural olfactory perception allows interaction with the environment from very early in life. To evaluate how newborn rabbits can extract and respond to information from the highly complex chemical surroundings, and how experience acts on this sensory, cognitive and behavioural capability, we ran a study in four steps including a total of eight experiments. We mainly used a binary AB mixture comprising ethyl isobutyrate (component A) and ethyl maltol (component B), previously shown as a bearer of blending properties; in rabbit pups (as in human adults), the mixture elicits a weak configural perception, i.e. the perception of a configural odour different from the odours of the components. First, a repeated exposure to one component of AB led to a more elemental perception of this mixture; conversely, a repeated exposure to AB facilitated its configural processing. Second, similar impact of experience did not appear with a non-blending AC mixture (ethyl isobutyrate-guaïacol). Third, repeated exposure to AB impacted not only the perception of AB, but also and in the same way the perception of the AC mixture sharing one component, and reciprocally. However, facilitation to perceive one mixture in one mode (configural/elemental) was not generalized to a mixture sharing no components with the experienced mixture [AB versus DE (damascenone and vanillin)]. Thus, experience contributes to the neonatal perception of odour mixtures and adds plasticity to the perceptual system. However, this impact remains dependent on the chemical composition of the mixtures."},{"title":"Apnea stimulates the adaptive response to oxidative stress in elephant seal pups","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4193","abstract":"Extended breath-hold (apnea) bouts are routine during diving and sleeping in seals. These apneas result in oxygen store depletion and blood flow redistribution towards obligatory oxygen-dependent tissues, exposing seals to critical levels of ischemia and hypoxemia. The subsequent reperfusion/reoxygenation has the potential to increase oxidant production and thus oxidative stress. The contributions of extended apnea to oxidative stress in adapted mammals are not well defined. To address the hypothesis that apnea in seals is not associated with increased oxidative damage, blood samples were collected from northern elephant seal pups (N=6) during eupnea, rest- and voluntary submersion-associated apneas, and post-apnea (recovery). Plasma 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), 8-isoprostanes (8-isoPGF2α), nitrotyrosine (NT), protein carbonyls, xanthine and hypoxanthine (HX) levels, along with xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, were measured. Protein content of XO, superoxide dismutase 1 (Cu,ZnSOD), catalase and myoglobin (Mb), as well as the nuclear content of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), were measured in muscle biopsies collected before and after the breath-hold trials. HNE, 8-iso PGF2α, NT and protein carbonyl levels did not change among eupnea, apnea or recovery. XO activity and HX and xanthine concentrations were increased at the end of the apneas and during recovery. Muscle protein content of XO, CuZnSOD, catalase, Mb, HIF-1α and Nrf2 increased 25–70% after apnea. Results suggest that rather than inducing the damaging effects of hypoxemia and ischemia/reperfusion that have been reported in non-diving mammals, apnea in seals stimulates the oxidative stress and hypoxic hormetic responses, allowing these mammals to cope with the potentially detrimental effects associated with this condition."},{"title":"Pregnancy is a drag: hydrodynamics, kinematics and performance in pre- and post-parturition bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4151","abstract":"Constraints on locomotion could be an important component of the cost of reproduction as carrying an increased load associated with eggs or developing fetuses may contribute to decreased locomotor performance for females across taxa and environments. Diminished performance could increase susceptibility to predation, yet the mechanism(s) by which gravidity and pregnancy affect locomotion remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that morphology, hydrodynamics and kinematics were altered during pregnancy, providing a mechanism for diminished locomotor performance in two near-term pregnant (10 days pre-parturition) bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Near-term pregnancy resulted in a 51±14% increase in frontal surface area, coinciding with dramatic increases in drag forces while gliding. For example, pregnant females encountered 80 N of drag at 1.7 m s–1 whereas that magnitude of drag was not encountered until speed doubled for females 18 months post-parturition. Indeed, drag coefficients based on frontal surface area were significantly greater during pregnancy (Cd,F=0.22±0.04) than at 18 months post-parturition (Cd,F=0.09±0.01). Pregnancy also induced a gait change as stroke amplitude and distance per stroke were reduced by 13 and 14%, respectively, compared with non-pregnant periods (1–24 months post-parturition). This was concomitant with a 62 and 44% reduction in mean and maximum swim speeds, respectively, during the pregnancy period. Interestingly, attack speeds of known predators of dolphins surpass maximum speeds for the pregnant dolphins in this study. Thus, pregnant dolphins may be more susceptible to predation. This study demonstrates unequivocally that changes in morphology, hydrodynamics and kinematics are associated with diminished performance during pregnancy in dolphins."},{"title":"Dynorphin regulates the phagocytic activity of splenic phagocytes in wall lizards: involvement of a κ-opioid receptor-coupled adenylate-cyclase–cAMP–PKA pathway","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4217","abstract":"This in vitro study of the wall lizard Hemidactylus flaviviridis demonstrates the role of the opioid peptide dynorphin A(1–17) [dyn A(1–17)] in the regulation of the phagocytic activity of splenic phagocytes. Dyn A(1–17) in a concentration-dependent manner inhibited the phagocytic activity, and the maximum inhibition was recorded at a concentration of 10–9 mol l–1. To explore the receptor-mediated effect of dyn A(1–17), cells were treated simultaneously with the non-selective opioid receptor blocker naltrexone and dyn A(1–17). Naltrexone completely blocked the inhibitory effect of dyn A(1–17) on phagocytosis. Moreover, the involvement of selective opioid receptors was investigated using selective opioid receptor antagonists. CTAP and naltrindole, selective μ- and δ-opioid receptor blockers, respectively, failed to block the inhibitory effect of dyn A(1–17) on phagocytosis. However, the selective κ-opioid receptor blocker NorBNI completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of dyn A(1–17). Regarding the κ-opioid receptor-coupled downstream signaling cascade, the adenylate cyclase (AC) inhibitor SQ 22536 and protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 decreased the inhibitory effect of dyn A(1–17) on phagocytosis. Furthermore, treatment with dyn A(1–17) caused an increase in intracellular cAMP content in splenic phagocytes. Thus, it can be concluded that, in H. flaviviridis, dyn A(1–17) negatively regulates the phagocytic activity of splenic phagocytes by acting through κ-opioid receptors that are coupled with the AC–cAMP–PKA signal transduction mechanism."},{"title":"Potentially adaptive effects of maternal nutrition during gestation on offspring phenotype of a viviparous reptile","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4234","abstract":"Viviparous reptiles have been used as model species for many studies that seek to explain the evolution of viviparity. The vast majority of such studies have focused on the advantage viviparity provides with regards to maternal control of embryonic developmental temperature. However, viviparity may also allow increased control of nutrient transfer, such that mothers adaptively manipulate offspring phenotype through varying maternal nutritional support. Because maternal nutritional transfer is temperature dependent, maternal nutritional strategies may vary between climatically distinct populations. In this study we used an orthogonal experimental design in which mothers and offspring from climatically distinct populations of a viviparous skink (Niveoscincus ocellatus) were allocated randomly to either a protein-rich or a protein-poor diet. Our results suggest that N. ocellatus mothers are able to compensate for sub-optimal nutritional conditions and can adaptively manipulate offspring phenotype to best fit the postnatal nutritional environment. Furthermore, maternal nutritional strategies appear to vary between climatically distinct populations. These results suggest that in viviparous reptiles, matrotrophy provides a means of producing an adaptive offspring phenotype, in addition to maternal control of developmental temperature."},{"title":"Social snails: the effect of social isolation on cognition is dependent on environmental context","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4179","abstract":"Social isolation is often considered to have negative effects on cognitive function in a wide range of species. Here we assess how environmental context alters the effect of isolation on long-term memory formation (24 h) in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. We operantly trained snails to reduce aerial respiration in hypoxia following exposure to one of three social conditions: (1) maintained and trained in groups; (2) maintained in groups, trained in isolation; or (3) maintained and trained in isolation. In addition, snails also experienced four stress exposure levels: control, exposure to low calcium availability, predator kairomone exposure during training or a combination of low calcium and predator kairomones. Snails isolated during training alone demonstrated no difference in memory formation compared with the snails trained in groups. Maintaining snails in social isolation for 8 days prior to training had a neutral effect on memory in control conditions or in the presence of predator kairomones alone. However, social isolation enhanced long-term memory formation in snails exposed to low calcium conditions, a stress that blocks memory formation in snails maintained in groups. Conversely, when exposed to low calcium and predator kairomones combined, grouped snails normally demonstrate long-term memory, but following maintenance in isolation long-term memory was blocked. Therefore, the effect of social isolation on cognitive function is highly dependent on the environmental context in which it is experienced."},{"title":"Physiological responses to self-induced burrowing and metabolic rate depression in the ocean quahog Arctica islandica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4223","abstract":"Arctica islandica is the longest-lived non-colonial animal found so far, and reaches individual ages of 150 years in the German Bight (GB) and more than 350 years around Iceland (IC). Frequent burrowing and physiological adjustments to low tissue oxygenation in the burrowed state are proposed to lower mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. We investigated burrowing patterns and shell water partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in experiments with live A. islandica. Furthermore, succinate accumulation and antioxidant defences were recorded in tissues of bivalves in the normoxic or metabolically downregulated state, as well as ROS formation in isolated gills exposed to normoxia, hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation. IC bivalves burrowed more frequently and deeper in winter than in summer under in situ conditions, and both IC and GB bivalves remained burrowed for between 1 and 6 days in laboratory experiments. Shell water PO2 was <5 kPa when bivalves were maintained in fully oxygenated seawater, and ventilation increased before animals entered the state of metabolic depression. Succinate did not accumulate upon spontaneous shell closure, although shell water PO2 was 0 kPa for over 24 h. A ROS burst was absent in isolated gills during hypoxia/reoxygenation, and antioxidant enzyme activities were not enhanced in metabolically depressed clams compared with normally respiring clams. Postponing the onset of anaerobiosis in the burrowed state and under hypoxic exposure presumably limits the need for elevated recovery respiration upon surfacing and oxidative stress during reoxygenation."},{"title":"Behavioural evidence for colour vision in an elasmobranch","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4186","abstract":"Little is known about the sensory abilities of elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) compared with other fishes. Despite their role as apex predators in most marine and some freshwater habitats, interspecific variations in visual function are especially poorly studied. Of particular interest is whether they possess colour vision and, if so, the role(s) that colour may play in elasmobranch visual ecology. The recent discovery of three spectrally distinct cone types in three different species of ray suggests that at least some elasmobranchs have the potential for functional trichromatic colour vision. However, in order to confirm that these species possess colour vision, behavioural experiments are required. Here, we present evidence for the presence of colour vision in the giant shovelnose ray (Glaucostegus typus) through the use of a series of behavioural experiments based on visual discrimination tasks. Our results show that these rays are capable of discriminating coloured reward stimuli from other coloured (unrewarded) distracter stimuli of variable brightness with a success rate significantly different from chance. This study represents the first behavioural evidence for colour vision in any elasmobranch, using a paradigm that incorporates extensive controls for relative stimulus brightness. The ability to discriminate colours may have a strong selective advantage for animals living in an aquatic ecosystem, such as rays, as a means of filtering out surface-wave-induced flicker."},{"title":"Patterns of coral ecological immunology: variation in the responses of Caribbean corals to elevated temperature and a pathogen elicitor","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/24/4240","abstract":"Disease epizootics are increasing with climatic shifts, yet within each system only a subset of species are identified as the most vulnerable. Understanding ecological immunology patterns as well as environmental influences on immune defenses will provide insight into the persistence of a functional system through adverse conditions. Amongst the most threatened ecosystems are coral reefs, with coral disease epizootics and thermal stress jeopardizing their survival. Immune defenses were investigated within three Caribbean corals, Montastraea faveolata, Stephanocoenia intersepta and Porites astreoides, which represent a range of disease and bleaching susceptibilities. Levels of several immune parameters were measured in response to elevated water temperature and the presence of a commercial pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) – lipopolysaccharide (LPS) – as an elicitor of the innate immune response. Immune parameters included prophenoloxidase (PPO) activity, melanin concentration, bactericidal activity, the antioxidants peroxidase and catalase, and fluorescent protein (FP) concentration. LPS induced an immune response in all three corals, although each species responded differently to the experimental treatments. For example, M. faveolata, a disease-susceptible species, experienced significant decreases in bactericidal activity and melanin concentration after exposure to LPS and elevated temperature alone. Porites astreoides, a disease-resistant species, showed increased levels of enzymatic antioxidants upon exposure to LPS independently and increased PPO activity in response to the combination of LPS and elevated water temperature. This study demonstrates the ability of reef-building corals to induce immune responses in the presence of PAMPs, indicating activation of PAMP receptors and the transduction of appropriate signals leading to immune effector responses. Furthermore, these data address the emerging field of ecological immunology by highlighting interspecific differences in immunity and immunocompetences among Caribbean corals, which are reflected in their life-history characteristics, disease susceptibilities and bleaching-induced mortality."},{"title":"Rapid contrast gain reduction following motion adaptation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/4000","abstract":"Neural and sensory systems adapt to prolonged stimulation to allow signaling across broader input ranges than otherwise possible with the limited bandwidth of single neurons and receptors. In the visual system, adaptation takes place at every stage of processing, from the photoreceptors that adapt to prevailing luminance conditions, to higher-order motion-sensitive neurons that adapt to prolonged exposure to motion. Recent experiments using dynamic, fluctuating visual stimuli indicate that adaptation operates on a time scale similar to that of the response itself. Further work from our own laboratory has highlighted the role for rapid motion adaptation in reliable encoding of natural image motion. Physiologically, motion adaptation can be broken down into four separate components. It is not clear from the previous studies which of these motion adaptation components are involved in the fast and dynamic response changes. To investigate the adapted response in more detail, we therefore analyzed the effect of motion adaptation using a test–adapt–test protocol with adapting durations ranging from 20 ms to 20 s. Our results underscore the very rapid rate of motion adaptation, suggesting that under free flight, visual motion-sensitive neurons continuously adapt to the changing scenery. This might help explain recent observations of strong invariance in the response to natural scenes with highly variable contrast and image structure."},{"title":"Pharmacological characterisation of apical Na+ and Cl– transport mechanisms of the anal papillae in the larval mosquito Aedes aegypti","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/3992","abstract":"The anal papillae of freshwater mosquito larvae are important sites of NaCl uptake, thereby acting to offset the dilution of the hemolymph by the dilute habitat.

We identified 76 genes upregulated in response to multiple cold exposure, 69 in response to prolonged cold exposure and 20 genes upregulated in response to a single short cold exposure, with a small amount of overlap between treatments. Three genes – Turandot A, Hephaestus and CG11374 – were upregulated in response to all three cold exposure treatments. Key functional groups upregulated include genes associated with muscle structure and function, the immune response, stress response, carbohydrate metabolism and egg production. We conclude that cold exposure has wide-ranging effects on gene expression in D. melanogaster and that increased duration or frequency of cold exposure has impacts different to those of a single short cold exposure. This has important implications for extrapolating laboratory studies of insect overwintering that are based on only a single cold exposure."},{"title":"Energy expenditure of freely swimming adult green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and its link with body acceleration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/4010","abstract":"Marine turtles are globally threatened. Crucial for the conservation of these large ectotherms is a detailed knowledge of their energy relationships, especially their at-sea metabolic rates, which will ultimately define population structure and size. Measuring metabolic rates in free-ranging aquatic animals, however, remains a challenge. Hence, it is not surprising that for most marine turtle species we know little about the energetic requirements of adults at sea. Recently, accelerometry has emerged as a promising tool for estimating activity-specific metabolic rates of animals in the field. Accelerometry allows quantification of the movement of animals (ODBA/PDBA, overall/partial dynamic body acceleration), which, after calibration, might serve as a proxy for metabolic rate. We measured oxygen consumption rates (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/214/23/4010/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>) of adult green turtles (Chelonia mydas; 142.1±26.9 kg) at rest and when swimming within a 13 m-long swim channel, using flow-through respirometry.

The low PO2 values and high H2S concentrations routinely encountered in the GI tract suggest that H2S might also be involved in hypoxic responses in these tissues. In the present study we examined the effect of H2S on stomach, esophagus, gallbladder and intestinal motility in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and we evaluated the potential for H2S in oxygen sensing by examining GI responses to hypoxia in the presence of known inhibitors of H2S biosynthesis and by adding the sulfide donor cysteine (Cys). We also measured H2S production by intestinal tissue in real time and in the presence and absence of oxygen. In tissues exhibiting spontaneous contractions, H2S inhibited contraction magnitude (area under the curve and amplitude) and frequency, and in all tissues it reduced baseline tension in a concentration-dependent relationship. Longitudinal intestinal smooth muscle was significantly more sensitive to H2S than other tissues, exhibiting significant inhibitory responses at 1–10 μmol l–1 H2S. The effects of hypoxia were essentially identical to those of H2S in longitudinal and circular intestinal smooth muscle; of special note was a unique transient stimulatory effect upon application of both hypoxia and H2S. Inhibitors of enzymes implicated in H2S biosynthesis (cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase) partially inhibited the effects of hypoxia whereas the hypoxic effects were augmented by the sulfide donor Cys. Furthermore, tissue production of H2S was inversely related to O2; addition of Cys to intestinal tissue homogenate stimulated H2S production when the tissue was gassed with 100% nitrogen (∼0% O2), whereas addition of oxygen (∼10% O2) reversed this to net H2S consumption. This study shows that the inhibitory effects of H2S on the GI tract of a non-mammalian vertebrate are identical to those reported in mammals and they provide further evidence that H2S is a key mediator of the hypoxic response in a variety of O2-sensitive tissues."},{"title":"Black wildebeest skeletal muscle exhibits high oxidative capacity and a high proportion of type IIx fibres","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/4041","abstract":"The aim of the study was to investigate the skeletal muscle characteristics of black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) in terms of fibre type and metabolism.

Citrate synthase (CS), 3-hydroxyacyl co A dehydrogenase (3HAD), phosphofructokinase (PFK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) activities were measured spectrophotometrically to represent the major metabolic pathways in these muscles. Both muscles had less than 20% MHC I, whereas MHC IIa and MHC IIx were expressed in excess of 50% in the vastus lateralis and longissimus lumborum muscles, respectively. Overall fibre size was 2675±1034 μm2, which is small compared with other species. Oxidative capacity (CS and 3HAD) in both muscles was high and did not differ from one another, but the longissimus lumborum had significantly (P<0.05) higher PFK, LDH and CK activities. No relationships were observed between fibre type and the oxidative and oxygen-independent metabolic capacity as measured by specific enzyme activities. This study confirms the presence of both fast-twitch fibres and high oxidative capacity in black wildebeest, indicating an animal that can run very fast but is also fatigue resistant."},{"title":"The inotropic effects of ammonia on isolated perfused rat hearts and the mechanisms involved","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/4048","abstract":"Ammonia (NH3) is a common exogenous gas in the atmosphere, as well as an endogenous chemical produced by amino acid catabolism and other pathways in vivo. Physiological and pathophysiological roles of NH3 in the nervous system have been studied. Recently, endogenous NH3 has been suggested to be a gas transmitter. However, so far the role of NH3 in cardiovascular functions has not been reported. The present study was designed to investigate the inotropic effects of NH3 on isolated perfused rat hearts and the possible mechanisms involved in these effects. The results showed that NH3 had a positive inotropic effect in a concentration-dependent manner and produced a higher positive effect than NaOH and NH4Cl. At low concentrations, the effect of NH3 on cardiac function was caused by NH3 molecules; at high concentrations, the effect of NH3 on hearts may be partly correlated with a change of pH value, but was mainly caused by NH3 molecules. The mechanisms involved in the NH3-induced positive inotropic effect may be related to the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel and the nitric oxide (NO)–cyclic GMP (cGMP) signaling pathway. In addition, at a concentration of 1.5 mmol l–1, NH3 significantly increased the activity of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the coronary perfusate and decreased the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase and Ca2+,Mg2+-ATPase in the hearts. These results indicate that NH3 at physiological or low concentrations may play a modulatory role in heart function, but at high concentrations had a damaging effect on isolated rat hearts."},{"title":"The recruiter's excitement – features of thoracic vibrations during the honey bee's waggle dance related to food source profitability","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/4055","abstract":"The honey bee's waggle dance constitutes a remarkable example of an efficient code allowing social exploitation of available feeding sites. In addition to indicating the position (distance, direction) of a food patch, both the occurrence and frequency of the dances depend on the profitability of the exploited resource (sugar concentration, solution flow rate). During the waggle dance, successful foragers generate pulsed thoracic vibrations that putatively serve as a source of different kinds of information for hive bees, who cannot visually decode dances in the darkness of the hive. In the present study, we asked whether these vibrations are a reliable estimator of the excitement of the dancer when food profitability changes in terms of both sugar concentration and solution flow rate. The probability of producing thoracic vibrations as well as several features related to their intensity during the waggle phase (pulse duration, velocity amplitude, duty cycle) increased with both these profitability variables. The number of vibratory pulses, however, was independent of sugar concentration and reward rate exploited. Thus, pulse number could indeed be used by dance followers as reliable information about food source distance, as suggested in previous studies. The variability of the dancer's thoracic vibrations in relation to changes in food profitability suggests their role as an indicator of the recruiter's motivational state. Hence, the vibrations could make an important contribution to forager reactivation and, consequently, to the organisation of collective foraging processes in honey bees."},{"title":"Associative learning between odorants and mechanosensory punishment in larval Drosophila","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/3897","abstract":"We tested whether Drosophila larvae can associate odours with a mechanosensory disturbance as a punishment, using substrate vibration conveyed by a loudspeaker (buzz: <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/214/23/3897/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>).

We further report an increase of associative performance scores with the number of punishments, and an increase according to the number of training cycles. Within the range tested (between 50 and 200 Hz), however, the pitch of the buzz does not apparently impact associative success. Last, but not least, we characterized odour–buzz memories with regard to the conditions under which they are behaviourally expressed – or not. In accordance with what has previously been found for associative learning between odours and bad taste (such as high concentration salt or quinine), we report that conditioned escape after odour–buzz learning is disabled if escape is not warranted, i.e. if no punishment to escape from is present during testing. Together with the already established paradigms for the association of odour and bad taste, the present assay offers the prospect of analysing how a relatively simple brain orchestrates memory and behaviour with regard to different kinds of ‘bad’ events."},{"title":"The effect of work cycle frequency on the potentiation of dynamic force in mouse fast twitch skeletal muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/3915","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the potentiation of concentric twitch force during work cycles is dependent upon both the speed and direction of length change. Concentric and eccentric forces were elicited by stimulating muscles during the shortening and lengthening phases, respectively, of work cycles. Work cycle frequency was varied in order to vary the speed of muscle shortening and/or lengthening; all forces were measured as the muscle passed though optimal length (Lo). Both concentric and eccentric force were assessed before (unpotentiated control) and after (potentiated) the application of a tetanic conditioning protocol known to potentiate twitch force output. The influence of the conditioning protocol on relative concentric force was speed dependent, with forces increased to 1.19±0.01, 1.25±0.01 and 1.30±0.01 of controls at 1.5, 3.3 and 6.9 Hz, respectively (all data N=9–10 with P<0.05). In contrast, the conditioning protocol had only a limited effect on eccentric force at these frequencies (range: 1.06±0.01 to 0.96±0.03). The effect of the conditioning protocol on concentric work (force × distance) was also speed dependent, being decreased at 1.5 Hz (0.84±0.01) and increased at 3.3 and 6.9 Hz (1.05±0.01 and 1.39±0.01, respectively). In contrast, eccentric work was not increased at any frequency (range: 0.88±0.02 to 0.99±0.01). Thus, our results reveal a hysteresis-like influence of activity-dependent potentiation such that concentric force and/or work were increased but eccentric force and/or work were not. These outcomes may have implications for skeletal muscle locomotor function in vivo."},{"title":"Changes in cardiac performance during hypoxic exposure in the grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/3906","abstract":"In hearts of higher invertebrates as well as vertebrates, the work performed by the ventricle is a function of both rate and contractility. Decapod crustaceans experience a hypoxia-induced bradycardia that is thought to result in an overall reduction in cardiac work; however, this hypothesis has not yet been tested and is the primary purpose of this study. In the grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio, cardiac pressure and area data were obtained simultaneously, and in vivo, under normoxic (20.2 kPa O2) and hypoxic (6.8 or 2.2 kPa O2) conditions and integrated to generate pressure–area (P–A) loops. The area enclosed by the P–A loop provides a measure of stroke work and, when multiplied by the heart rate, provides an estimate of both cardiac work and myocardial O2 consumption. Changes in intra-cardiac pressure (dp/dt) are correlated to the isovolemic contraction phase and provide an indication of stroke work. At both levels of hypoxic exposure, intra-cardiac pressure, dp/dt, stroke work and cardiac work fell significantly. The significant decrease in intra-cardiac pressure provides the primary mechanism for the decrease in stroke work, and, when coupled with the hypoxia-induced bradycardia, it contributes to an overall fall in cardiac work. Compared with normoxic P–A loops, hypoxic P–A loops (at both levels of hypoxia) become curvilinear, indicating a fall in peripheral resistance (which might account for the reduction in intra-cardiac pressure), which would reduce both stroke work and cardiac work and ultimately would serve to reduce myocardial O2 consumption. This is the most direct evidence to date indicating that the hypoxia-induced bradycardia observed in many decapod crustaceans reduces cardiac work and is therefore energetically favorable during acute exposure to conditions of low oxygen."},{"title":"Neuronal correlates of a preference for leading signals in the synchronizing bushcricket Mecopoda elongata (Orthoptera, Tettigoniidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/3924","abstract":"Acoustically interacting males of the tropical katydid Mecopoda elongata synchronize their chirps imperfectly, so that one male calls consistently earlier in time than the other. In choice situations, females prefer the leader signal, and it has been suggested that a neuronal mechanism based on directional hearing may be responsible for the asymmetric, stronger representation of the leader signal in receivers. Here, we investigated the potential mechanism in a pair of interneurons (TN1 neuron) of the afferent auditory pathway, known for its contralateral inhibitory input in directional hearing. In this interneuron, conspecific signals are reliably encoded under natural conditions, despite high background noise levels. Unilateral presentations of a conspecific chirp elicited a TN1 response where each suprathreshold syllable in the chirp was reliably copied in a phase-locked fashion. Two identical chirps broadcast with a 180 deg spatial separation resulted in a strong suppression of the response to the follower signal, when the time delay was 20 ms or more. Muting the ear on the leader side fully restored the response to the follower signal compared with unilateral controls. Time–intensity trading experiments, in which the disadvantage of the follower signal was traded against higher sound pressure levels, demonstrated the dominating influence of signal timing on the TN1 response, and this was especially pronounced at higher sound levels of the leader. These results support the hypothesis that the female preference for leader signals in M. elongata is the outcome of a sensory mechanism that originally evolved for directional hearing."},{"title":"Developmental trajectories of gene expression reveal candidates for diapause termination: a key life-history transition in the apple maggot fly Rhagoletis pomonella","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/3948","abstract":"The timing of dormancy is a rapidly evolving life-history trait playing a crucial role in the synchronization of seasonal life cycles and adaptation to environmental change. But the physiological mechanisms regulating dormancy in animals remain poorly understood. In insects, dormancy (diapause) is a developmentally dynamic state, and the mechanisms that control diapause transitions affect seasonal timing. Here we used microarrays to examine patterns of gene expression during dormancy termination: a crucial life-history transition in the apple maggot fly Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh). This species is a model system for host race formation and ecological speciation via changes in diapause regulation of seasonality. Our goal was to pinpoint the timing of the transition from diapause to post-diapause development and to identify candidate genes and pathways for regulation of diapause termination. Samples were taken at six metabolically defined developmental landmarks, and time-series analysis suggests that release from metabolic depression coincides with preparation for or resumption of active cell cycling and morphogenesis, defining the ‘end’ of diapause. However, marked changes in expression, including members of pathways such as Wnt and TOR signaling, also occur prior to the metabolic rate increase, electing these pathways as candidates for early regulation of diapause termination. We discuss these results with respect to generalities in insect diapause physiology and to our long-term goal of identifying mechanisms of diapause adaptation in the Rhagoletis system."},{"title":"Flea infestation does not cause a long-term increase in energy metabolism in Gerbillus nanus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/3968","abstract":"Fleas can increase the metabolic rate of their hosts. It has been suggested that a constitutive response, in which the host constantly maintains a relatively high level of energy metabolism to combat the parasite, is advantageous for hosts with high parasite infestation, while an induced response, in which the host increases energy metabolism in response to a parasite attack, is advantageous with low parasite infestation. As free-living Gerbillus nanus show a relatively low flea infestation, we hypothesized that this host uses an induced strategy and, consequently, flea infestation would not impose a long-term effect on energy metabolism. In a previous study in spring, higher field metabolic rate (FMR) was found in free-living parasitized than in non-parasitized G. nanus. In this study, G. nanus were captured at Hazeva in spring; some had fleas (N=14) and some did not (N=10). We brought them to the laboratory, removed the fleas from those that were infested and, after 3 weeks, measured average daily metabolic rate (ADMR) of all rodents. ADMR averaged 8.68±0.95 kJ g–0.54 day–1 for all rodents and was similar between previously parasitized and non-parasitized G. nanus while free living. Thus, the hypothesis that flea infestation does not have a long-term effect on energy metabolism was supported, as was the idea of an induced over a constitutive immune response by G. nanus in combating parasites."},{"title":"Locomotor activity during the frenzy swim: analysing early swimming behaviour in hatchling sea turtles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/3972","abstract":"Swimming effort of hatchling sea turtles varies across species. In this study we analysed how swim thrust is produced in terms of power stroke rate, mean maximum thrust per power stroke and percentage of time spent power stroking throughout the first 18 h of swimming after entering the water, in both loggerhead and flatback turtle hatchlings and compared this with previous data from green turtle hatchlings. Loggerhead and green turtle hatchlings had similar power stroke rates and percentage of time spent power stroking throughout the trial, although mean maximum thrust was always significantly higher in green hatchlings, making them the most vigorous swimmers in our three-species comparison. Flatback hatchlings, however, were different from the other two species, with overall lower values in all three swimming variables. Their swimming effort dropped significantly during the first 2 h and kept decreasing significantly until the end of the trial at 18 h. These results support the hypothesis that ecological factors mould the swimming behaviour of hatchling sea turtles, with predator pressure being important in determining the strategy used to swim offshore. Loggerhead and green turtle hatchlings seem to adopt an intensely vigorous and energetically costly frenzy swim that would quickly take them offshore into the open ocean in order to reduce their exposure to near-shore aquatic predators. Flatback hatchlings, however, are restricted in geographic distribution and remain within the continental shelf region where predator pressure is probably relatively constant. For this reason, flatback hatchlings might use only part of their energy reserves during a less vigorous frenzy phase, with lower overall energy expenditure during the first day compared with loggerhead and green turtle hatchlings."},{"title":"Changes in wingstroke kinematics associated with a change in swimming speed in a pteropod mollusk, Clione limacina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/3935","abstract":"In pteropod mollusks, the gastropod foot has evolved into two broad, wing-like structures that are rhythmically waved through the water for propulsion. The flexibility of the wings lends a tremendous range of motion, an advantage that could be exploited when changing locomotory speed. Here, we investigated the kinematic changes that take place during an increase in swimming speed in the pteropod mollusk Clione limacina. Clione demonstrates two distinct swim speeds: a nearly constant slow swimming behavior and a fast swimming behavior used for escape and hunting. The neural control of Clione's swimming is well documented, as are the neuromuscular changes that bring about Clione's fast swimming. This study examined the kinematics of this swimming behavior at the two speeds. High speed filming was used to obtain 3D data from individuals during both slow and fast swimming. Clione's swimming operates at a low Reynolds number, typically under 200. Within a given swimming speed, we found that wing kinematics are highly consistent from wingbeat to wingbeat, but differ between speeds. The transition to fast swimming sees a significant increase in wing velocity and angle of attack, and range of motion increases as the wings bend more during fast swimming. Clione likely uses a combination of drag-based and unsteady mechanisms for force production at both speeds. The neuromuscular control of Clione's speed change points to a two-gaited swimming behavior, and we consider the kinematic evidence for Clione's swim speeds being discrete gaits."},{"title":"Kingfisher feathers – colouration by pigments, spongy nanostructures and thin films","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/3960","abstract":"The colours of the common kingfisher, Alcedo atthis, reside in the barbs of the three main types of feather: the orange breast feathers, the cyan back feathers and the blue tail feathers.

The cyan and blue barbs contain spongy nanostructures with slightly different dimensions, causing different reflectance spectra. Imaging scatterometry showed that the pigmented barbs create a diffuse orange scattering and the spongy barb structures create iridescence. The extent of the angle-dependent light scattering increases with decreasing wavelength. All barbs have a cortical envelope with a thickness of a few micrometres. The reflectance spectra of the cortex of the barbs show oscillations when measured from small areas, but when measured from larger areas the spectra become wavelength independent. This can be directly understood with thin film modelling, assuming a somewhat variable cortex thickness. The cortex reflectance appears to be small but not negligible with respect to the pigmentary and structural barb reflectance."},{"title":"IRS and TOR nutrient-signaling pathways act via juvenile hormone to influence honey bee caste fate","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/3977","abstract":"Regardless of genetic makeup, a female honey bee becomes a queen or worker depending on the food she receives as a larva. For decades, it has been known that nutrition and juvenile hormone (JH) signaling determine the caste fate of the individual bee. However, it is still largely unclear how these factors are connected. To address this question, we suppressed nutrient sensing by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene knockdown of IRS (insulin receptor substrate) and TOR (target of rapamycin) in larvae reared on queen diet. The treatments affected several layers of organismal organization that could play a role in the response to differential nutrition between castes. These include transcript profiles, proteomic patterns, lipid levels, DNA methylation response and morphological features. Most importantly, gene knockdown abolished a JH peak that signals queen development and resulted in a worker phenotype. Application of JH rescued the queen phenotype in either knockdown, which demonstrates that the larval response to JH remains intact and can drive normal developmental plasticity even when IRS or TOR transcript levels are reduced. We discuss our results in the context of other recent findings on honey bee caste and development and propose that IRS is an alternative substrate for the Egfr (epidermal growth factor receptor) in honey bees. Overall, our study describes how the interplay of nutritional and hormonal signals affects many levels of organismal organization to build different phenotypes from identical genotypes."},{"title":"Carbon isotopic fractionation in eider adipose tissue varies with fatty acid structure: implications for trophic studies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3790","abstract":"Carbon isotopic fractionation was investigated in fatty acids (FA) of adipose tissue and blood serum of threatened Steller's eiders (Polysticta stelleri) and spectacled eiders (Somateria fischeri) relative to the FA in their diets. Captive eiders were fed a known diet for 180 days with serum sampled at 60, 120 and 180 days immediately after a 12 fast; adipose was collected at 180 days. Essential FA (EFA) in the adipose showed varying degrees of isotope fractionation (0–4‰), depending on FA structure. The δ13C values of long-chain FA 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 did not differ from those in the diet, while those of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 were ∼2‰ greater than in the diet. The δ13C values of free FA (FFA) in serum were not consistent within individuals or sampling dates; fractionation varied randomly, suggesting that FFA were arising from diet, rather than mobilization from adipose tissue. Discrimination factors were used in combination with a mixing model incorporating FA and lipid concentrations to estimate the diet of eiders fed a binary mixture with contrasting isotopic signatures. Diet estimates varied with FA but mean values closely approximated the actual proportions consumed. By tracking EFA, this study avoided the complications in interpretation arising from isotopic routing of carbon in bulk isotope analyses and serves as a basis for the development of compound-specific isotopic methods to trace dietary input in wild eiders. However, our understanding of the processes contributing to the variation in isotopic signatures of FA in nature is currently limited, and we recommend that future research directions focus on elucidating these mechanisms."},{"title":"Urotensin II and its receptor in the killifish gill: regulators of NaCl extrusion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/23/3985","abstract":"The peptide urotensin II (UII) and its receptor (UT) mediate cardiovascular and renal effects in both mammals and fishes.

In fishes, gill extrusion of NaCl is inhibited by UII, but a single study has determined that UT is expressed in gill vasculature, not on the epithelium that mediates the transport. To begin to clarify the pathways involved in UII inhibition of gill transport, we have cloned the cDNA encoding UII and UT from the euryhaline killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus L.) gill and spinal cord, quantified UT mRNA expression in various tissues and measured relative expression in gill tissue from fish acclimated to seawater (SW) vs fresh water (FW). We have also localized UT in the gill epithelium, and measured the effect of UII on ion transport across the opercular epithelium. We found that both UII and UT are synthesized in the gill of F. heteroclitus and that gill UT mRNA levels are ∼80% higher in SW- vs FW-acclimated individuals. In addition, UII inhibits NaCl transport across the opercular epithelium in a concentration-dependent manner, and this inhibition is at least partially mediated by both nitric oxide and a prostanoid."},{"title":"Social synchronization of circadian locomotor activity rhythm in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3742","abstract":"Circadian clocks regulate the physiology and behaviour of organisms across a wide range of taxa. To keep track of local time, these clocks use a variety of time cues such as light–dark, temperature, food availability and social interaction cycles. This study assessed the role of social cues in modulating circadian clocks of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Using pair-wise interactions, we first estimated the percentage contribution of each interacting partner on the cumulative rhythmic behaviour of the pairs. Subsequently, we studied the effects of multi-individual (group-wise) interactions on the rhythmic behaviour of the group by estimating phase synchrony between individuals of different strains (having different circadian periods) maintained in both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups. Although it is known that social interactions improve synchrony between interacting individuals, we asked whether such interactions are able to synchronize the circadian rhythms of highly phase-desynchronized flies. We found that, although interactions between fly strains possessing different circadian periods failed to produce synchrony, social interactions among phase-desynchronized flies did enhance the phase synchrony of the interacting individuals. Differently phased individuals living in social groups displayed significantly greater phase synchrony than those living solitarily. Social synchronization is olfaction mediated as group-wise interactions among phase-desynchronized flies possessing compromised olfactory ability (Or83b0) did not improve phase synchrony. These results suggest that social cues synchronize the circadian clocks of Drosophila provided that the interacting individuals have similar clock periods."},{"title":"Developmentally regulated multisensory integration for prey localization in the medicinal leech","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3801","abstract":"Medicinal leeches, like many aquatic animals, use water disturbances to localize their prey, so they need to be able to determine if a wave disturbance is created by prey or by another source.

We found that juveniles more readily localize wave sources of lower frequencies (2 Hz) than their adult counterparts (8–12 Hz), and that adolescents exhibited elements of both juvenile and adult behavior, readily localizing sources of both frequencies. Leeches are known to be able to localize the source of waves through the use of either mechanical or visual information. We separately characterized their ability to localize various frequencies of stimuli using unimodal cues. Within a single modality, the frequency–response curves of adults and juveniles were virtually indistinguishable. However, the differences between the responses for each modality (visual and mechanosensory) were striking. The optimal visual stimulus had a much lower frequency (2 Hz) than the optimal mechanical stimulus (12 Hz). These frequencies matched, respectively, the juvenile and the adult preferred frequency for multimodally sensed waves. This suggests that, in the multimodal condition, adult behavior is driven more by mechanosensory information and juvenile behavior more by visual. Indeed, when stimuli of the two modalities were placed in conflict with one another, adult leeches, unlike juveniles, were attracted to the mechanical stimulus much more strongly than to the visual stimulus."},{"title":"Mechanisms of stable lipid loss in a social insect","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3808","abstract":"Worker honey bees undergo a socially regulated, highly stable lipid loss as part of their behavioral maturation. We used large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic experiments, physiological experiments and RNA interference to explore the mechanistic basis for this lipid loss. Lipid loss was associated with thousands of gene expression changes in abdominal fat bodies. Many of these genes were also regulated in young bees by nutrition during an initial period of lipid gain. Surprisingly, in older bees, which is when maximum lipid loss occurs, diet played less of a role in regulating fat body gene expression for components of evolutionarily conserved nutrition-related endocrine systems involving insulin and juvenile hormone signaling. By contrast, fat body gene expression in older bees was regulated more strongly by evolutionarily novel regulatory factors, queen mandibular pheromone (a honey bee-specific social signal) and vitellogenin (a conserved yolk protein that has evolved novel, maturation-related functions in the bee), independent of nutrition. These results demonstrate that conserved molecular pathways can be manipulated to achieve stable lipid loss through evolutionarily novel regulatory processes."},{"title":"Inter-relationship between mitochondrial function and susceptibility to oxidative stress in red- and white-blooded Antarctic notothenioid fishes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3732","abstract":"It is unknown whether Antarctic fishes can defend themselves against oxidative stress induced by elevations in temperature. We hypothesized that Antarctic icefishes, lacking the oxygen-binding protein hemoglobin, might be more vulnerable to temperature-induced oxidative stress compared with red-blooded notothenioids because of differences in their mitochondrial properties. Mitochondria from icefishes have higher densities of phospholipids per mg of mitochondrial protein compared with red-blooded species, and these phospholipids are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which can promote the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, previous studies have shown that multiple tissues in icefishes have lower levels of antioxidants compared with red-blooded species. We quantified several properties of mitochondria, including proton leak, rates of ROS production, membrane composition and susceptibility to lipid peroxidation (LPO), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant power (TAOP) in mitochondria isolated from hearts of icefishes and red-blooded notothenioids. Mitochondria from icefishes were more tightly coupled than those of red-blooded fishes at both 2°C and 10°C, which increased the production of ROS when the electron transport chain was disrupted. The activity of SOD and TAOP per mg of mitochondrial protein was equivalent between icefishes and red-blooded species, but TAOP normalized to mitochondrial phospholipid content was significantly lower in icefishes compared with red-blooded fishes. Additionally, membrane susceptibility to peroxidation was only detectable in icefishes at 1°C and not in red-blooded species. Together, our results suggest that the high density of mitochondrial phospholipids in hearts of icefishes may make them particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress as temperatures rise."},{"title":"Relationship between oxidizable fatty acid content and level of antioxidant glutathione peroxidases in marine fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3751","abstract":"Biological membranes can be protected from lipid peroxidation by antioxidant enzymes including catalase (CAT) and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases 1 and 4 (GPx1 and GPx4). Unlike GPx1, GPx4 can directly detoxify lipid hydroperoxides in membranes without prior action of phospholipase A2. We hypothesized that (1) GPx4 is enhanced in species that contain elevated levels of highly oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and (2) activities of antioxidant enzymes are prioritized to meet species-specific oxidative stresses. In this study we examined (i) activities of the oxidative enzyme citrate synthase (CS) and antioxidant (CAT, GPx1 and GPx4) enzymes, (ii) GPx4 protein expression, and (iii) phospholipid composition in livers of five species of marine fish (Myxine glutinosa, Petromyzon marinus, Squalus acanthias, Fundulus heteroclitus and Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus) that contain a range of PUFA. GPx4 activity was, on average, 5.8 times higher in F. heteroclitus and S. acanthias than in the other three marine fish species sampled. Similarly, activities of CAT and GPx1 were highest in S. acanthias and F. heteroclitus, respectively. GPx4 activity for all species correlates with membrane unsaturation, as well as oxidative activity as indicated by CS. These data support our hypothesis that GPx4 level in marine fish is a function, at least in part, of high PUFA content in these animals. GPx1 activity was also correlated with membrane unsaturation, indicating that marine species partition resources among glutathione-dependent defenses for protection from the initial oxidative insult (e.g. H2O2) and to repair damaged lipids within biological membranes."},{"title":"Preferred movement patterns during a simple bouncing task","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3768","abstract":"Elastic tissues in the human body can store and return mechanical energy passively, reducing the metabolic cost of cyclical movements. However, it is not clear whether humans prefer movement patterns that optimize this storage and return. We investigated the preferred movement pattern during a bouncing task for which non-invasive techniques can identify the resonant frequency, which is the least metabolically costly. We quantified the preferred and resonant bounce frequencies for three mechanical conditions. During 'normal' trials, subjects bounced while reclined on a sled that moves along a track. During 'added mass' trials, mass was added to the sled. During 'added stiffness' trials, a spring was attached between the sled and the supporting frame, parallel to the track. Subsequently, we quantified the preferred bounce frequencies during ischemia, a technique that disrupts the available sensory feedback. Mechanical condition had a significant effect on both the preferred and resonant frequencies. Changes in preferred frequency scaled with resonant frequency, but the preferred frequency was significantly lower than the resonant frequency. These results indicate that humans adapt their preferred bouncing pattern in response to changes in mechanical condition. Humans may prefer a lower than resonant frequency because of an inability to sense metabolic cost during our relatively short trials. In contrast, during ischemia the preferred bounce frequency remained constant even when mechanical condition was varied, indicating that feedback is necessary to adapt the preferred frequency to changes in mechanics. These findings suggest that disrupted sensory feedback may prevent humans from choosing the optimal movement pattern."},{"title":"Ammonotely in a neotropical frugivorous bat as energy intake decreases","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3775","abstract":"We tested the role of increased ammonia in urine as an energy- and/or nitrogen (N)-saving mechanism in the great fruit-eating bat Artibeus lituratus (Phyllostomidae). We compared N excretion in two groups of bats fed energy-rich (2.75 kJ g–1 wet mass) or energy-poor diets (0.7 kJ g–1 wet mass). Within each diet, bats were assigned to different N contents. In order to function as an energy-saving mechanism, ammonia production should increase with decreasing energy intake. To function as an N-saving mechanism, ammonia production should increase with decreasing N intake. Because we varied both diet energy density and N content, our study design allowed us to test these two possibilities simultaneously. Bats had higher food intake rate and, consequently, higher N intake rate on the energy-poor diet, but energy intake rate was lower. Most bats on the energy-rich diet were ureotelic whereas on the energy-poor diet bats were ureotelic, ammonotelic or ureo-ammonotelic. Bats fed the energy-poor diet had a higher excretion rate of ammonia and a higher percent of N excreted as ammonia. Percent N ammonia and ammonia excretion rate were inversely related to energy intake, but they were not related to N intake. By favoring ammonia production over urea, bats on the energy-poor diet may save up to 1% of their basal metabolic rate. Consumption of energy-dilute fruits by fruit bats might affect the way in which N wastes are excreted, favoring the excretion of ammonia N when food intake is accompanied by the ingestion of large volumes of water."},{"title":"Penguin head movement detected using small accelerometers: a proxy of prey encounter rate","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3760","abstract":"Determining temporal and spatial variation in feeding rates is essential for understanding the relationship between habitat features and the foraging behavior of top predators. In this study we examined the utility of head movement as a proxy of prey encounter rates in medium-sized Antarctic penguins, under the presumption that the birds should move their heads actively when they encounter and peck prey. A field study of free-ranging chinstrap and gentoo penguins was conducted at King George Island, Antarctica. Head movement was recorded using small accelerometers attached to the head, with simultaneous monitoring for prey encounter or body angle. The main prey was Antarctic krill (>99% in wet mass) for both species. Penguin head movement coincided with a slow change in body angle during dives. Active head movements were extracted using a high-pass filter (5 Hz acceleration signals) and the remaining acceleration peaks (higher than a threshold acceleration of 1.0 g) were counted. The timing of head movements coincided well with images of prey taken from the back-mounted cameras: head movement was recorded within ±2.5 s of a prey image on 89.1±16.1% (N=7 trips) of images. The number of head movements varied largely among dive bouts, suggesting large temporal variations in prey encounter rates. Our results show that head movement is an effective proxy of prey encounter, and we suggest that the method will be widely applicable for a variety of predators."},{"title":"Influence of elevated temperature on metabolism during aestivation: implications for muscle disuse atrophy","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3782","abstract":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced commensurate with aerobic metabolic rate, contribute to muscle disuse atrophy (MDA) in immobilised animals by damaging myoskeletal protein and lipids. Aestivating frogs appear to avoid MDA in part by substantially suppressing metabolic rate. However, as ectotherms, metabolic rate is sensitive to environmental temperature, and the high ambient temperatures that may be experienced by frogs during aestivation could in fact promote MDA. In this study, we investigated the effect of temperature on the metabolic rate of the aestivating frog Cyclorana alboguttata and its skeletal muscles in order to determine their likely susceptibility to MDA. Compared with non-aestivating frogs, a significant decrease in metabolic rate was recorded for aestivating frogs at 20, 24 and 30°C. At 30°C, however, the metabolic rate of aestivating frogs was significantly higher, approximately double that of frogs aestivating at 20 or 24°C, and the magnitude of the metabolic depression was significantly reduced at 30°C compared with that at 20°C. Temperature effects were also observed at the tissue level. At 24 and 30°C the metabolic rate of all muscles from aestivating frogs was significantly depressed compared with that of muscles from non-aestivating frogs. However, during aestivation at 30°C the metabolic rates of gastrocnemius, sartorius and cruralis were significantly elevated compared with those from frogs aestivating at 24°C. Our data show that the metabolism of C. alboguttata and its skeletal muscles is elevated at higher temperatures during aestivation and that the capacity of the whole animal to actively depress metabolism is impaired at 30°C."},{"title":"Static inflation and deflation pressure–volume curves from excised lungs of marine mammals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3822","abstract":"Excised lungs from eight marine mammal species [harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus), harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), gray seal (Halichoerus grypush), Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas) and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena)] were used to determine the minimum air volume of the relaxed lung (MAV, N=15), the elastic properties (pressure–volume curves, N=24) of the respiratory system and the total lung capacity (TLC).

Measured MAV was on average 7% of TLC, with a range from 0 to 16%. The pressure–volume curves were similar among species on inflation but diverged during deflation in phocids in comparison with odontocetes.

Such sounds may reflect physical attributes of the sound-production mechanism, be constrained by body size and therefore control signal reliability during agonistic behaviors. We examined kinematics of the cranium, median fins and caudal peduncle during sound production in two territorial chaetodontid butterflyfish sister species: forcepsfish (Forcipiger flavissimus) and longnose butterflyfish (F. longirostris). During intraspecific agonistic encounters, both species emit a single pulse sound that precedes rapid cranial rotation at velocities and accelerations that exceed those of prey strikes by many ram-and suction-feeding fishes. Electromyography showed that onsets of activity for anterior epaxialis, sternohyoideus, A1 and A2 adductor mandibulae muscles and sound emission are coincident but precede cranial elevation. Observations indicate that sound production is driven by epaxial muscle contraction whereas a ventral linkage between the head and pectoral girdle is maintained by simultaneous activity from the adductor mandibulae and sternohyoideus. Thus, the girdle, ribs and rostral swim bladder are pulled anteriorly before the head is released and rotated dorsally. Predictions of the hypothesis that acoustic signals are indicators of body size and kinematic performance were confirmed. Variation in forcepsfish sound duration and sound pressure level is explained partly by cranial elevation velocity and epaxial electromyogram duration. Body size, however, explains most variation in duration and sound pressure level. These observed associations indicate that forcepsfish sounds may be accurate indicators of size and condition that are related to resource holding potential during social encounters."},{"title":"Dopamine as an anorectic neuromodulator in the cockroach Rhyparobia maderae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3843","abstract":"Insects, including cockroaches, self-select a balanced diet when faced with different nutrient choices.

When R. maderae nymphs were injected with 20 μl of 100 mmol l–1 DA, they showed an 83.3% reduction in sucrose intake and a 78.9% reduction in total intake compared with saline-injected controls. The DA agonist, 2-amino-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (6,7-ADTN) (100 mmol l–1 in 1 μl), caused a significant reduction in sucrose feeding, reducing feeding by 47.3% compared with saline-injected controls. Protein feeding was also significantly reduced by 6,7-ADTN to 62%. Rhyparobia maderae nymphs injected with the DA antagonist chlorpromazine (100 mmol l–1 in 1 μl) did not differ significantly from control nymphs in their feeding behavior. Interestingly, R. maderae nymphs injected with 2 μl or 5 μl chlorpromazine (100 mmol l–1) showed significantly increased mortality rates of 47.5% or 66.7%, respectively. The DA antagonist, spiperone (100 mmol l–1 in 1 μl), caused a significant feeding response, showing an increase in feeding in both sucrose (310.6%) and total intake (236.3%). Casein feeding in R. maderae nymphs was also elevated (70.8%) but this was not statistically significant. The experiments with DA, the DA agonist 6,7-ADTN and the DA antagonist spiperone strongly suggest that the neurotransmitter DA is involved in regulating feeding in the cockroach R. maderae."},{"title":"Effects of ocean-acidification-induced morphological changes on larval swimming and feeding","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3857","abstract":"Reduction in global ocean pH due to the uptake of increased atmospheric CO2 is expected to negatively affect calcifying organisms, including the planktonic larval stages of many marine invertebrates. Planktonic larvae play crucial roles in the benthic–pelagic life cycle of marine organisms by connecting and sustaining existing populations and colonizing new habitats. Calcified larvae are typically denser than seawater and rely on swimming to navigate vertically structured water columns. Larval sand dollars Dendraster excentricus have calcified skeletal rods supporting their bodies, and propel themselves with ciliated bands looped around projections called arms. Ciliated bands are also used in food capture, and filtration rate is correlated with band length. As a result, swimming and feeding performance are highly sensitive to morphological changes. When reared at an elevated PCO2 level (1000 ppm), larval sand dollars developed significantly narrower bodies at fourand six-arm stages. Morphological changes also varied between four observed maternal lineages, suggesting within-population variation in sensitivity to changes in PCO2 level. Despite these morphological changes, PCO2 concentration alone had no significant effect on swimming speeds. However, acidified larvae had significantly smaller larval stomachs and bodies, suggesting reduced feeding performance. Adjustments to larval morphologies in response to ocean acidification may prioritize swimming over feeding, implying that negative consequences of ocean acidification are carried over to later developmental stages."},{"title":"Regulation of brain temperature in winter-acclimatized reindeer under heat stress","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3850","abstract":"Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) are protected against the Arctic winter cold by thick fur of prime insulating capacity and hence have few avenues of heat loss during work.

Animals were instrumented for measurements of blood flow, tissue temperatures and respiratory frequency (f) under full anaesthesia, whereas measurements were also made in fully conscious animals while in a climatic chamber or running on a treadmill. At rest, brain temperature (Tbrain) rose from 38.5±0.1°C at 10°C to 39.5±0.2°C at 50°C, while f increased from ×7 to ×250 breaths min–1, with a change to open-mouth panting (OMP) at Tbrain 39.0±0.1°C, and carotid and sublingual arterial flows increased by 160% and 500%, respectively. OMP caused jugular venous and carotid arterial temperatures to drop, presumably owing to a much increased respiratory evaporative heat loss. Angular oculi vein (AOV) flow was negligible until Tbrain reached 38.9±0.1°C, but it increased to 0.81 ml min–1 kg–1 at Tbrain 39.2±0.2°C. Bilateral occlusion of both AOVs induced OMP and a rise in Tbrain and f at Tbrain >38.8°C. We propose that reindeer regulate body and, particularly, brain temperature under heavy heat loads by a combination of panting, at first through the nose, but later, when the heat load and the minute volume requirements increase due to exercise, primarily through the mouth and that they eventually resort to selective brain cooling."},{"title":"An aphid's Odyssey – the cortical quest for the vascular bundle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3868","abstract":"Sensing pH and sucrose concentration (with a preference for pH values of 7.0–7.5 and sucrose concentrations of approximately 400 mmol l–1) enables aphids to recognise sieve tubes inside vascular bundles. However, it is still unclear how aphids find their way to the vascular bundles. Membrane potentials in the cortex of Vicia faba stems were measured along a radial transect from the epidermis to the sieve elements and there was no gradient detected that could be used by aphids to guide their stylets to the sieve elements. Additionally, aphids did not demonstrate a preference between artificial diets with low or high levels of dissolved oxygen, making it unlikely that oxygen gradients in the cortex assist orientation towards the phloem. Tracks of salivary sheaths indicate that aphids search for vascular bundles in a radial direction (perpendicular from the stem surface to the vascular bundle) with regular side punctures in a pre-programmed fashion. Optical examination and electrical penetration graph (EPG) recordings suggest that aphids (Megoura viciae) probe the vacuolar sap of cortex cells. Acidic pH (5.0–5.5) and low sucrose concentrations in vacuoles, therefore, may provoke aphids to retract their stylets and probe the next cell until a favourable cell sap composition is encountered. The importance of sucrose as a cue was demonstrated by the experimental manipulation of Ricinus communis plants that cause them to transport hexoses instead of sucrose. Aphids (Aphis fabae) ingested less phloem sap of plants transporting hexoses compared with plants transporting the normal sucrose. The proposed rejection–acceptance behaviour provides a universal plant-directed mode of how aphids orientate their stylets towards the phloem."},{"title":"Ultrasound biomicroscopy for biomechanical characterization of healthy and injured triceps surae of rats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/22/3880","abstract":"This work describes the use of ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) to follow up the degeneration–regeneration process after a laceration injury induced in the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and soleus (SOL) muscles of rats.

The animals were distributed in three groups: the variability group (VG; N=5), the gastrocnemius injured group (GG; N=6) and the soleus injured group (SG; N=5). VG rats were used to assess data variability and reliability (coefficients of variation of 9.37 and 3.97% for PA and MT, respectively). GG and SG rats were submitted to the injury protocol in the LG and SOL muscles of the right legs, respectively. UBM images of muscles of both legs were acquired at the following time points: before and after injury (immediately, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days). We observed an increase in PA for the non-injured leg 28 days after injury for both GG and SG rats (GG=10.68 to 16.53 deg and SG=9.65 to 14.06 deg; P<0.05). Additionally, MT presented a tendency to increase (GG=2.92 to 3.13 mm and SG=2.12 to 2.35 mm). Injured legs maintained pre-injury PA and MT values.

To evaluate the hypothesis that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) could be involved in that response, we have incubated the hypothalamus and hindbrain of rainbow trout at different glucose concentrations in the presence of different concentrations of CRF. Under those conditions, we evaluated whether parameters related to glucosensing [the levels of glucose, glycogen and glucose 6-phosphate, the activities of glucokinase (GK), glycogen synthase (GSase) and pyruvate kinase (PK), and mRNA abundance of transcripts for GK, Glut2, Kir.6-like and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)-like] are modified in the presence of CRF in a way comparable to that observed under stress conditions. We obtained evidence allowing us to suggest that CRF could be involved in the interaction between stress and glucosensing as CRF treatment of the hypothalamus and hindbrain in vitro induced a readjustment in glucosensing parameters similar to that previously observed under stress conditions in vivo. We had also previously demonstrated that stress elicits alterations in food intake in parallel with the readjustment of glucosensing systems. Here, we provide evidence that the mRNA abundance of several of the neuropeptides involved in the regulation of food intake, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) or cocaineand amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), is affected by CRF treatment, in such a way that their expression does not respond to changes in glucose levels in the same way as controls, allowing us to suggest that the food intake response that is integrated by changes in those peptides and known to be reduced by stress could be also mediated by CRF action in glucosensing areas."},{"title":"The chemical basis of host nest detection and chemical integration in a cuckoo paper wasp","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3698","abstract":"Insect social life is governed by chemicals.

It is not surprising, therefore, that social parasites, specialized in exploiting the costly parental care provided by host workers, exploit the host chemical communication system too. Throughout their life cycle, social parasites intercept and break this CHC-based code. Recently, however, several polar compounds (mainly peptides) have been found in addition to CHCs both on the cuticle and on the comb surface of social insects, and their semiochemical role has been demonstrated in some circumstances. In the present study, we used the paper wasp social parasite–host system Polistes sulcifer (Zimmerman)–Polistes dominulus (Christ) to evaluate the relative importance of the CHCs and polar compounds in two different steps of the host exploitation process: host nest detection by the pre-usurping parasite and parasite chemical integration into the host colony. After separating the polar and apolar fractions of the host nest as well as those of pre- and post-usurpation parasites, we carried out laboratory assays based on the binary choice model. Our results show that nest polar compounds neither are used by the parasite to detect the host's nest nor play a role in parasite chemical integration into the host colony. In contrast, we demonstrate that CHCs are fundamental in both steps, thus confirming their primary role in social insect life and consequently in social parasite–host interactions."},{"title":"Spring phenology does not affect timing of reproduction in the great tit (Parus major)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3664","abstract":"Many seasonal breeders adjust the timing of reproduction in response to year-to-year variations in supplementary environmental cues, amongst which ambient temperature is thought to be most influential.

This hypothesis was investigated in breeding pairs of great tits kept in outdoor aviaries. In spring, experimental pairs were provided with access to leafing birch branches and caterpillars as a visual food cue, while control pairs were provided with non-leafing branches. Observations were made on the onset of laying and on concentrations of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) at regular intervals to monitor changes in reproductive function. The onset of egg laying was not advanced by the presence of leafing branches and caterpillars. LH concentrations increased during the course of the study, but phenological cues did not affect plasma LH levels in females and males. Early spring vegetation, such as the leafing of birch branches, and the appearance of caterpillar prey do not appear to play a significant role in fine-tuning the onset of egg laying in great tits."},{"title":"Increased plant volatile production affects oviposition, but not larval development, in the moth Helicoverpa armigera","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3672","abstract":"It is well established that herbivorous insects respond to changes in plant odour production, but little attention has been given to whether these responses relate to direct fitness costs of plant volatile production on insect growth and survival.

They are typically described by physiologically structured population models (PSPMs). Therefore, inverse modelling offers a tool to identify parameters of individual physiological processes through population-level data analysis, e.g. the temperature dependence of growth from size–frequency data of a field population. Here, we make use of experiments under laboratory conditions, in mesocosms and field monitoring to determine the temperature dependence of growth and mortality of Gammarus pulex. We found an optimum temperature for growth of approximately 17°C and a related temperature coefficient, Q10, of 1.5°C–1, irrespective of whether we classically fitted individual growth curves or applied inverse modelling based on PSPMs to laboratory data. From a comparison of underlying data sets we conclude that applying inverse modelling techniques to population-level data results in meaningful response parameters for physiological processes if additional temperature-driven effects, including within-population interaction, can be excluded or determined independently. If this is not the case, parameter estimates describe a cumulative response, e.g. comprising temperature-dependent resource dynamics. Finally, fluctuating temperatures in natural habitats increased the uncertainty in parameter values. Here, PSPM should be applied for virtual monitoring in order to determine a sampling scheme that comprises important dates to reduce parameter uncertainty."},{"title":"An evaluation of muscle maintenance costs during fiber hypertrophy in the lobster Homarus americanus: are larger muscle fibers cheaper to maintain?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3688","abstract":"Large muscle fiber size imposes constraints on muscle function while imparting no obvious advantages, making it difficult to explain why muscle fibers are among the largest cell type. Johnston and colleagues proposed the ‘optimal fiber size’ hypothesis, which states that some fish have large fibers that balance the need for short diffusion distances against metabolic cost savings associated with large fibers. We tested this hypothesis in hypertrophically growing fibers in the lobster Homarus americanus. Mean fiber diameter was 316±11 μm in juveniles and 670±26 μm in adults, leading to a surface area to volume ratio (SA:V) that was 2-fold higher in juveniles. Na+/K+-ATPase activity was also 2-fold higher in smaller fibers. 31P-NMR was used with metabolic inhibitors to determine the cost of metabolic processes in muscle preparations. The cost of Na+/K+-ATPase function was also 2-fold higher in smaller than in larger diameter fibers. Extrapolation of the SA:V dependence of the Na+/K+-ATPase over a broad fiber size range showed that if fibers were much smaller than those observed, maintenance of the membrane potential would constitute a large fraction of whole-animal metabolic rate, suggesting that the fibers grow large to reduce maintenance costs. However, a reaction–diffusion model of aerobic metabolism indicated that fibers in adults could attain still larger sizes without diffusion limitation, although further growth would have a negligible effect on cost. Therefore, it appears that decreased fiber SA:V makes larger fibers in H. americanus less expensive to maintain, which is consistent with the optimal fiber size hypothesis."},{"title":"Sound production in red-bellied piranhas (Pygocentrus nattereri, Kner): an acoustical, behavioural and morphofunctional study","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3613","abstract":"Piranhas are known to be sound-producing animals.

The piranha swimbladder is thought to play an important role in sound production as an impedance-matching device and as a resonator. However, the vibratory capacities of the cranial and caudal sacs and the exact role of both sacs in sound production remain poorly understood. In this study, three sounds were each associated to a specific behaviour. The first sound (type 1) was produced during frontal display; it had numerous pulses and lasted 140!±17 ms, with a fundamental frequency of 120±4 Hz. It corresponded to the sound made by hand-held fishes. The second sound (type 2) was produced during circling and fighting behaviour; it was a single pulse lasting 36±8 ms, with a fundamental frequency of 43±10 Hz. The third sound (type 3) corresponded to chasing behaviour and comprised three to four pulses, each lasting 3±1 ms, with a fundamental frequency of 1739±18 Hz. Using a laser vibrometer to study the swimbladder displacement when stimulated at different frequencies, it was demonstrated that the first two sounds corresponded to the swimbladder mechanism. By contrast, the third sound was associated with the jaw mechanism. The vibrometer indicated that the swimbladder is a highly damping structure, simply copying the sonic muscle contraction rate. This study provides two interesting insights. First, it shows the relationships between three kinds of piranha sound and three specific behaviours. Second, using muscle stimulation at different rates, it shows which simultaneous conditions are required for production of sound in this species. Swimbladder calls were produced by a muscle contraction rate of approximately 100 Hz because this periodicity allowed the swimbladder to vibrate. At this frequency range, the contraction–relaxation cycles of the swimbladder muscles engendered wall displacements that had short amplitudes and with only a small variability between them."},{"title":"Low metabolism in a tropical bat from lowland Panama measured using heart rate telemetry: an unexpected life in the slow lane","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3605","abstract":"Animals must optimize their daily energy budgets, particularly if energy expenditures are as high as they are in flying animals. However, energy budgets of free-ranging tropical animals are poorly known. Newly miniaturized heart rate transmitters enabled this to be addressed this in the small, energetically limited, neotropical bat Molossus molossus. High-resolution 48 h energy budgets showed that this species significantly lowers its metabolism on a daily basis, even though ambient temperatures remain high. Mean roosting heart rate was 144 beats min–1, much lower than expected for a 10 g bat. Low roosting heart rates combined with short nightly foraging times (37 min night–1) resulted in an estimated energy consumption of 4.08 kJ day–1, less than one-quarter of the predicted field metabolic rate. Our results indicate that future research may reveal this as a more common pattern than currently assumed in tropical animals, which may have implications in the context of the effect of even small temperature changes on tropical species."},{"title":"Vocal control by the common marmoset in the presence of interfering noise","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3619","abstract":"The natural environment is inherently noisy with acoustic interferences. It is, therefore, beneficial for a species to modify its vocal production to effectively communicate in the presence of interfering noises. Non-human primates have been traditionally considered to possess limited voluntary vocal control, but little is known about their ability to modify vocal behavior when encountering interfering noises. Here we tested the ability of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to control the initiation of vocalizations and maintain vocal interactions between pairs in an acoustic environment in which the length and predictability (periodic or random aperiodic occurrences) of interfering noise bursts were varied. Despite the presence of interfering noise, the marmosets continued to engage in antiphonal calling behavior. Results showed that the overwhelming majority of calls were initiated during silence gaps even when the length of the silence gap following each noise burst was unpredictable. During the periodic noise conditions, as the length of the silence gap decreased, the latency between the end of noise burst and call onset decreased significantly. In contrast, when presented with aperiodic noise bursts, the marmosets chose to call predominantly during long (4 and 8 s) over short (2 s) silence gaps. In the 8 s periodic noise conditions, a marmoset pair either initiated both calls of an antiphonal exchange within the same silence gap or exchanged calls in two consecutive silence gaps. Our findings provide compelling evidence that common marmosets are capable of modifying their vocal production according to the dynamics of their acoustic environment during vocal communication."},{"title":"Identification and functional characterization of an ovarian aquaporin from the cockroach Blattella germanica L. (Dictyoptera, Blattellidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3630","abstract":"Aquaporins (AQPs) are membrane proteins that form water channels, allowing rapid movement of water across cell membranes. AQPs have been reported in species of all life kingdoms and in almost all tissues, but little is known about them in insects. Our purpose was to explore the occurrence of AQPs in the ovary of the phylogenetically basal insect Blattella germanica (L.) and to study their possible role in fluid homeostasis during oogenesis. We isolated an ovarian AQP from B. germanica (BgAQP) that has a deduced amino acid sequence showing six potential transmembrane domains, two NPA motifs and an ar/R constriction region, which are typical features of the AQP family. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that BgAQP belongs to the PRIP group of insect AQPs, previously suggested to be water specific. However, ectopic expression of BgAQP in Xenopus laevis oocytes demonstrated that this AQP transports water and modest amounts of urea, but not glycerol, which suggests that the PRIP group of insect AQPs may have heterogeneous solute preferences. BgAQP was shown to be highly expressed in the ovary, followed by the fat body and muscle tissues, but water stress did not significantly modify the ovarian expression levels. RNA interference (RNAi) reduced BgAQP mRNA levels in the ovary but the oocytes developed normally. The absence of an apparent ovarian phenotype after BgAQP RNAi suggests that other functionally redundant AQPs that were not silenced in our experiments might exist in the ovary of B. germanica."},{"title":"Intraspecific variation in the thermal plasticity of mitochondria in killifish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3639","abstract":"Populations of the Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) inhabit salt marshes and estuaries along the eastern coast of North America from Newfoundland to northern Florida, and are thus exposed to a large range of temperatures. Previous studies have shown higher whole-organism metabolic rates in the northern subspecies (F. h. macrolepidotus) compared with the southern subspecies (F. h. heteroclitus) of these fish. Here, we examine phenotypic plasticity in the response to cold temperatures between the two subspecies by acclimating fish to 5, 15 and 25°C and comparing several mitochondrial and muscle properties. The relative area of oxidative muscle versus glycolytic muscle fibers was greater in the northern subspecies at the 5 and 15°C acclimation temperatures. However, there were no differences in capillary density between the two subspecies or at different temperatures. Mitochondrial volume and surface densities increased in response to cold temperature acclimation in red and white muscle, but only in the northern killifish. Citrate synthase activities also increased in the northern killifish at 5 and 15°C. The ratio of calculated [free ADP] to [ATP] increased in the 5°C acclimated southern killifish but not in the northern killifish at 5°C when compared with the 15°C acclimation group, suggesting that there are differences in adenylate signaling for mitochondrial respiration between subspecies at low temperature. Taken together, our data indicate that the northern subspecies have a greater ability to increase mitochondrial capacity at colder temperatures compared with the southern subspecies, providing one of the few examples of intraspecific variation in phenotypic plasticity in mitochondrial amount in response to cold temperatures."},{"title":"Thermal adaptation in the intertidal snail Echinolittorina malaccana contradicts current theory by revealing the crucial roles of resting metabolism","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3649","abstract":"Contemporary theory for thermal adaptation of ectothermic metazoans focuses on the maximization of energy gain and performance (locomotion and foraging). Little consideration is given to the selection for mechanisms that minimize resting energy loss in organisms whose energy gain is severely constrained. We tested a hypothetical framework for thermal performance of locomotor activity (a proxy for energy gain) and resting metabolism (a proxy for energy loss) in energetically compromised snails in the littoral fringe zone, comparing this with existing theory. In contrast to theory, the thermal ranges and optima for locomotor performance and metabolic performance of Echinolittorina malaccana are mismatched, and energy gain is only possible at relatively cool temperatures. To overcome thermal and temporal constraints on energy gain while experiencing high body temperatures (23–50°C), these snails depress resting metabolism between 35 and 46°C (thermally insensitive zone). The resulting bimodal relationship for metabolism against temperature contrasts with the unimodal or exponential relationships of most ectotherms. Elevation of metabolism above the breakpoint temperature for thermal insensitivity (46°C) coincides with the induction of a heat shock response, and has implications for energy expenditure and natural selection. Time-dependent mortality is initiated at this breakpoint temperature, suggesting a threshold above which the rate of energy demand exceeds the capacity for cellular energy generation (rate of ATP turnover). Mortality in a thermal range that elevates rather than limits aerobic metabolism contrasts with the hypothesis that cellular oxygen deficiency underlies temperature-related mortality. The findings of this study point to the need to incorporate aspects of resting metabolism and energy conservation into theories of thermal adaptation."},{"title":"Flicker-induced eye movements and the behavioural temporal cut-off frequency in a nocturnal spider","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3658","abstract":"We investigated changes in the eye muscle activity in the spider Cupiennius salei as a response to temporal intensity modulations. These spiders are known to enhance eye muscle activity in their principal eyes when moving stimuli are detected in the secondary eyes. We measured the activity of the dorsal eye muscle using a small telemetric unit attached to the spiders' prosoma and confronted the animals to flicker stimuli presented on a cathode ray tube monitor. We registered a significant increase in eye muscle activity as response to temporal light intensity modulations, which implies that no directed motion is required to trigger the spiders' response. This allowed the determination of the behavioural temporal cut-off frequency. None of the frequencies higher than 8.6 cycles s–1 and all of the frequencies lower than 4.3 cycles s–1 elicited a significant increase in eye muscle activity. A behavioural cut-off frequency of only a few cycles per second is well in line with the temporal properties of the photoreceptor cells determined using intracellular recordings. A relatively low temporal resolution and a relatively high spatial resolution suit well C. salei's lifestyle as a nocturnal sit-and-wait hunter."},{"title":"Spectral sensitivity of the principal eyes of sunburst diving beetle, Thermonectus marmoratus (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae), larvae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3524","abstract":"The principal eyes of sunburst diving beetle, Thermonectus marmoratus, larvae are among the most unusual eyes in the animal kingdom. They are composed of long tubes connecting bifocal lenses with two retinas: a distal retina situated a few hundred micrometers behind the lens, and a proximal retina that is situated directly beneath. A recent molecular study on first instar larvae suggests that the distal retina expresses a long-wavelength-sensitive opsin (TmLW), whereas the proximal retina predominantly expresses an ultraviolet-sensitive opsin (TmUV II). Using cloning and in situ hybridization we here confirm that this opsin distribution is, for the most part, maintained in third instar larvae (with the exception of the TmUV I that is weakly expressed only in proximal retinas of first instar larvae). We furthermore use intracellular electrophysiological recordings and neurobiotin injections to determine the spectral sensitivity of individual photoreceptor cells. We find that photoreceptors of the proximal retina have a sensitivity curve that peaks at 374–375 nm. The shape of the curve is consistent with the predicted absorbance of a single-opsin template. The spectral response of photoreceptors from the distal retina confirms their maximum sensitivity to green light with the dominant λ-peak between 520 and 540 nm, and the secondary β-peak between 340 and 360 nm. These physiological measurements support molecular predictions and represent important steps towards understanding the functional organization of the unusual stemmata of T. marmoratus larvae."},{"title":"Variation in expression of calcium-handling proteins is associated with inter-individual differences in mechanical performance of rat (Rattus norvegicus) skeletal muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3542","abstract":"An important constraint on locomotor performance is the trade-off between sprint and endurance performance. One intuitive explanation for this trade-off is that an individual muscle cannot excel at generating both maximal force/power and high fatigue resistance. The underlying reasons for this muscle trade-off are poorly defined. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that inter-individual variation in muscle mechanics is associated with inter-individual differences in metabolic capacities and expression of calcium-handling proteins. Lateral gastrocnemius muscles were isolated from 20 rats (Rattus norvegicus) and analysed to determine metabolic capacity, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA)1 protein concentration, total SERCA activity, and mRNA concentrations of SERCA1, SERCA2, troponin I and ryanodine receptors. Isometric studies of lateral gastrocnemius muscles at 30°C showed that muscles with higher sprint performance had lower fatigue resistance. More rapid muscle contraction was correlated with higher lactate dehydrogenase activity and increased expression of ryanodine receptor 1. More rapid muscle relaxation was correlated with increased expression of troponin I type 2 (fast) isoform and decreased expression of SERCA2 (slow) isoform. Treating muscles with dantrolene confirmed that ryanodine receptor activity is important in determining tetanus force and muscle contraction rates, but has no effect on fatigue resistance. Thapsigargin treatment revealed that SERCA activity determines fatigue resistance but does not affect maximal muscle force or contraction rates. We conclude that the opposing roles of SERCA activity and expression of ryanodine receptors in determining fatigue resistance and force production, respectively, at least partly explain differences in sprint and endurance performance in isolated rat gastrocnemius muscle."},{"title":"Phototransduction and clock gene expression in the troglobiont beetle Ptomaphagus hirtus of Mammoth cave","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3532","abstract":"Obligatory cave species exhibit dramatic trait modifications such as eye reduction, loss of pigmentation and an increase in touch receptors. As molecular studies of cave adaptation have largely concentrated on vertebrate models, it is not yet possible to probe for genetic universalities underlying cave adaptation. We have therefore begun to study the strongly cave-adapted small carrion beetle Ptomaphagus hirtus. For over 100 years, this flightless signature inhabitant of Mammoth Cave, the world's largest known cave system, has been considered blind despite the presence of residual lens structures. By deep sequencing of the adult head transcriptome, we discovered the transcripts of all core members of the phototransduction protein machinery. Combined with the absence of transcripts of select structural photoreceptor and eye pigmentation genes, these data suggest a reduced but functional visual system in P. hirtus. This conclusion was corroborated by a negative phototactic response of P. hirtus in light/dark choice tests. We further detected the expression of the complete circadian clock gene network in P. hirtus, raising the possibility of a role of light sensation in the regulation of oscillating processes. We speculate that P. hirtus is representative of a large number of animal species with highly reduced but persisting visual capacities in the twilight zone of the subterranean realm. These can now be studied on a broad comparative scale given the efficiency of transcript discovery by next-generation sequencing."},{"title":"Anthropogenic noise affects song structure in red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3549","abstract":"Anthropogenic noise can mask animal signals that are crucial for communicating information about food, predators and mating opportunities. In response to noise masking, signallers can potentially improve acoustic signal transmission by adjusting the timing, frequency or amplitude of their signals. These changes can be a short-term modification in response to transient noise or a long-term modification in response to chronic noise. An animal's ability to adapt to anthropogenic noise can be crucial to its success. In this study, we evaluated the effects of anthropogenic noise on the structure of red-winged blackbird song. First, we manipulated the presence of anthropogenic noise by experimentally broadcasting either silence or low-frequency white noise to subjects inhabiting quiet marshes located away from roadsides. Subjects exhibited increased signal tonality when temporarily exposed to low-frequency white noise, suggesting that red-winged blackbirds can alter their signals rapidly in response to sudden noise. Second, we compared songs produced in quiet marshes located away from roadsides with songs produced during quiet periods at roadside marshes that are normally noisy. This allowed us to test whether birds that are exposed to chronic anthropogenic noise exhibit altered song structure during temporarily quiet periods. Subjects residing in roadside marshes that are normally polluted with anthropogenic noise sang songs with increased tonality during quiet periods. Overall, our results show that anthropogenic noise influences the structure of birdsong. These effects should be considered in conservation and wildlife management."},{"title":"First evidence for zooplankton feeding sustaining key physiological processes in a scleractinian cold-water coral","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3570","abstract":"Scleractinian cold-water corals (CWC) represent key taxa controlling deep-sea reef ecosystem functioning by providing structurally complex habitats to a high associated biodiversity, and by fuelling biogeochemical cycles via the release of organic matter. Nevertheless, our current knowledge on basic CWC properties, such as feeding ecology and key physiological processes (i.e. respiration, calcification and organic matter release), is still very limited. Here, we show evidence for the trophic significance of zooplankton, essentially sustaining levels of the investigated key physiological processes in the cosmopolitan CWC Desmophyllum dianthus (Esper 1794). Our results from laboratory studies reveal that withdrawal (for up to 3 weeks) of zooplankton food (i.e. Artemia salina) caused a significant decline in respiration (51%) and calcification (69%) rates compared with zooplankton-fed specimens. Likewise, organic matter release, in terms of total organic carbon (TOC), decreased significantly and eventually indicated TOC net uptake after prolonged zooplankton exclusion. In fed corals, zooplankton provided 1.6 times the daily metabolic C demand, while TOC release represented 7% of zooplankton-derived organic C. These findings highlight zooplankton as a nutritional source for D. dianthus, importantly sustaining respiratory metabolism, growth and organic matter release, with further implications for the role of CWC as deep-sea reef ecosystem engineers."},{"title":"Visual conditioning of the sting extension reflex in harnessed honeybees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3577","abstract":"Visual performances of honeybees have been extensively studied using free-flying individuals trained to choose visual stimuli paired with sucrose reward. By contrast, harnessed bees in the laboratory were not thought to be capable of learning a Pavlovian association between a visual stimulus (CS) and sucrose reward (US). For reasons as yet unknown, harnessed bees only learn visual cues in association with sucrose if their antennae are ablated. However, slow acquisition and low retention performances are obtained in this case. Here, we established a novel visual conditioning protocol, which allows studying visual learning and memory in intact harnessed bees in the laboratory. This protocol consists of conditioning the sting extension reflex (SER) by pairing a visual stimulus (CS+) with an electric shock punishment (US), and a different visual stimulus (CS–) with the absence of shock. Bees with intact antennae learned the discrimination between CS+ and CS– by using chromatic cues, achromatic cues or both. Antennae ablation was not only unnecessary for learning to occur but it even impaired visual SER conditioning because of a concomitant reduction of responsiveness to the electric shock. We thus established the first visual conditioning protocol on harnessed honeybees that does not require injuring the experimental subjects. This novel experimental approach opens new doors for accessing the neural correlates of visual learning and memory in honeybees."},{"title":"A nose-to-nose comparison of the physiological and molecular responses of rainbow trout to high environmental ammonia in seawater versus freshwater","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3557","abstract":"Steelhead rainbow trout acclimated to either freshwater (FW) or seawater (SW) were exposed to high environmental ammonia (HEA, 1000 μmol l–1 NH4HCO3, pH 7.8–8.0) for 24 h. SW trout restored ammonia excretion more rapidly (3–6 h versus 9–12 h in FW), despite higher production rates and lower plasma pH. Plasma total ammonia levels stabilized at comparable levels below the external HEA concentration, and blood acid–base disturbances were small at both salinities. The electrochemical gradients for NH4+ entry (FNH4+) were the same in the two salinities, but only because FW trout allowed their transepithelial potential to rise by ∼15 mV during HEA exposure. Elevation of plasma [cortisol] during HEA exposure was more prolonged in SW fish. Plasma [glucose] increased in SW, but decreased in FW trout. Plasma [urea-N] also decreased in FW, in concert with elevated urea transporter (UT) mRNA expression in the gills. Of 13 branchial transporters, baseline mRNA expression levels were higher for Rhcg1, NHE2, NKCC1a and UT, and lower for NBC1 and NKA-α1a in SW trout, whereas NKA-α1b, NHE3, CA2, H+-ATPase, Rhag, Rhbg and Rhcg2 did not differ. Of the Rh glycoprotein mRNAs responding to HEA, Rhcg2 was greatly upregulated in both FW and SW, Rhag decreased only in SW and Rhcg1 decreased only in FW. H+-ATPase mRNA increased in FW whereas NHE2 mRNA increased in SW; NHE3 did not respond, and V-type H+-ATPase activity declined in SW during HEA exposure. Branchial Na+,K+-ATPase activity was much higher in SW gills, but could not be activated by NH4+. Overall, the more effective response of SW trout was explained by differences in physical chemistry between SW and FW, which greatly reduced the plasma NH3 tension gradient for NH3 entry, as well as by the higher [Na+] in SW, which favoured Na+-coupled excretion mechanisms. At a molecular level, responses in SW trout showed subtle differences from those in FW trout, but were very different than in the SW pufferfish. Upregulation of Rhcg2 appears to play a key role in the response to HEA in both FW and SW trout, and NH4+ does not appear to move through Na+,K+-ATPase."},{"title":"Effects of early-stage aging on locomotor dynamics and hindlimb muscle force production in the rat","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3588","abstract":"Attenuation of locomotor function is common in many species of animals as they age. Dysfunctions may emerge from a constellation of age-related impairments, including increased joint stiffness, reduced ability to repair muscle tissue, and decreasing fine motor control capabilities. Any or all of these factors may contribute to gait abnormalities and substantially limit an animal's speed and mobility. In this study we examined the effects of aging on whole-animal locomotor performance and hindlimb muscle mechanics in young adult rats aged 6–8 months and ‘early aged’ 24-month-old rats (Rattus norvegicus, Fischer 344 × Brown Norway crosses). Analyses of gaits and kinematics demonstrated that aged rats moved significantly more slowly, sustained longer hindlimb support durations, moved with a greater proportion of asymmetrical gaits, were more plantigrade, and moved with a more kyphotic spinal posture than the young rats. Additionally, the external mechanical energy profiles of the aged animals were variable across trials, whereas the younger rats moved predominantly with bouncing mechanics. In situ analyses of the ankle extensor/plantar flexor muscle group (soleus, plantaris, and medial and lateral gastrocnemii) revealed reduced maximum force generation with aging, despite minimal changes in muscle mass. The weakened muscles were implicated in the degradation of hindfoot posture, as well as variability in center-of-mass mechanics. These results demonstrate that the early stages of aging have consequences for whole-body performance, even before age-related loss of muscle mass begins."},{"title":"Sound-induced tympanal membrane motion in bushcrickets and its relationship to sensory output","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/21/3596","abstract":"In the auditory system of bushcrickets, sound can reach the receptors via two different paths: (i) by acting on the outside of the tympana situated on both sides of each foreleg or (ii) through the acoustic trachea that opens at a spiracle on the thorax. While the spiracle is considered to be the main point of sound entry for higher audio and ultrasonic frequencies, the role of the tympana is still unclear. The tympana border the air-filled acoustic trachea as well as the fluid-filled haemolymph channel containing the receptor organs. To understand their role during sound transduction, the sound-induced neuronal response of the hearing organ was recorded in combination with measurement of tympanal membrane motion using laser-Doppler vibrometry. For far-field stimulation, the frequency of the most sensitive hearing (∼16 kHz) matched the frequency of a pronounced maximum of tympanal membrane vibration. A second maximum of tympanum motion at lower frequencies (∼7 kHz) was correlated with an increased nerve activity at higher intensities (>70 dB sound pressure level, SPL). These correlations support the hypothesis of functional coupling between tympanum motion and nerve activity. When sound stimuli were applied locally, through either the tympanum or the spiracle, significant differences between tympanum motion and nerve activity were found. These discrepancies show that tympanum motion and neuronal response are not coupled directly and that there is no linear relationship with the applied SPL. Taken together, these data verify a functional, albeit indirect, coupling of tympanum motion and sensory cell activity for one of the pronounced vibration maxima, which appears to represent a resonance frequency of the tympanum."},{"title":"Cues to body size in the formant spacing of male koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) bellows: honesty in an exaggerated trait","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3414","abstract":"Determining the information content of vocal signals and understanding morphological modifications of vocal anatomy are key steps towards revealing the selection pressures acting on a given species' vocal communication system. Here, we used a combination of acoustic and anatomical data to investigate whether male koala bellows provide reliable information on the caller's body size, and to confirm whether male koalas have a permanently descended larynx. Our results indicate that the spectral prominences of male koala bellows are formants (vocal tract resonances), and show that larger males have lower formant spacing. In contrast, no relationship between body size and the fundamental frequency was found. Anatomical investigations revealed that male koalas have a permanently descended larynx: the first example of this in a marsupial. Furthermore, we found a deeply anchored sternothyroid muscle that could allow male koalas to retract their larynx into the thorax. While this would explain the low formant spacing of the exhalation and initial inhalation phases of male bellows, further research will be required to reveal the anatomical basis for the formant spacing of the later inhalation phases, which is predictive of vocal tract lengths of around 50 cm (nearly the length of an adult koala's body). Taken together, these findings show that the formant spacing of male koala bellows has the potential to provide receivers with reliable information on the caller's body size, and reveal that vocal adaptations allowing callers to exaggerate (or maximise) the acoustic impression of their size have evolved independently in marsupials and placental mammals."},{"title":"Pleated turtle escapes the box – shape changes in Dermochelys coriacea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3474","abstract":"Typical chelonians have a rigid carapace and plastron that form a box-like structure that constrains several aspects of their physiology and ecology. The leatherback sea turtle, Dermochelys coriacea, has a flexible bony carapace strengthened by seven longitudinal ridges, whereas the plastron is reduced to an elliptical outer bony structure, so that the ventrum has no bony support. Measurements of the shell were made on adult female leatherbacks studied on the feeding grounds of waters off Nova Scotia (NS) and on breeding beaches of French Guiana (FG) to examine whether foraging and/or breeding turtles alter carapace size and/or shape. NS turtles exhibited greater mass and girth for a given curved carapace length (CCL) than FG turtles. Girth:CCL ratios rose during the feeding season, indicating increased girth. Measurements were made of the direct (straight) and surface (curved) distances between the medial longitudinal ridge and first right-hand longitudinal ridge (at 50% CCL). In NS turtles, the ratio of straight to curved inter-ridge distances was significantly higher than in FG turtles, indicating distension of the upper surfaces of the NS turtles between the ridges. FG females laid 11 clutches in the breeding season; although CCL and curved carapace width remained stable, girth declined between each nesting episode, indicating loss of mass. Straight to curved inter-ridge distance ratios did not change significantly during the breeding season, indicating loss of dorsal blubber before the onset of breeding. The results demonstrate substantial alterations in size and shape of female D. coriacea over periods of weeks to months in response to alterations in nutritional and reproductive status."},{"title":"Femoral loading mechanics in the Virginia opossum, Didelphis virginiana: torsion and mediolateral bending in mammalian locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3455","abstract":"Studies of limb bone loading in terrestrial mammals have typically found anteroposterior bending to be the primary loading regime, with torsion contributing minimally. However, previous studies have focused on large, cursorial eutherian species in which the limbs are held essentially upright. Recent in vivo strain data from the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), a marsupial that uses a crouched rather than an upright limb posture, have indicated that its femur experiences appreciable torsion during locomotion as well as strong mediolateral bending. The elevated femoral torsion and strong mediolateral bending observed in D. virginiana might result from external forces such as a medial inclination of the ground reaction force (GRF), internal forces deriving from a crouched limb posture, or a combination of these factors. To evaluate the mechanism underlying the loading regime of opossum femora, we filmed D. virginiana running over a force platform, allowing us to measure the magnitude of the GRF and its three-dimensional orientation relative to the limb, facilitating estimates of limb bone stresses. This three-dimensional analysis also allows evaluations of muscular forces, particularly those of hip adductor muscles, in the appropriate anatomical plane to a greater degree than previous two-dimensional analyses. At peak GRF and stress magnitudes, the GRF is oriented nearly vertically, inducing a strong abductor moment at the hip that is countered by adductor muscles on the medial aspect of the femur that place this surface in compression and induce mediolateral bending, corroborating and explaining loading patterns that were identified in strain analyses. The crouched orientation of the femur during stance in opossums also contributes to levels of femoral torsion as high as those seen in many reptilian taxa. Femoral safety factors were as high as those of non-avian reptiles and greater than those of upright, cursorial mammals, primarily because the load magnitudes experienced by opossums are lower than those of most mammals. Thus, the evolutionary transition from crouched to upright posture in mammalian ancestors may have been accompanied by an increase in limb bone load magnitudes."},{"title":"Carotenoid intake does not affect immune-stimulated oxidative burst in greenfinches","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3467","abstract":"Carotenoid-based integument colouration is extremely widespread in the animal kingdom. It has been hypothesized that carotenoid colouration is used for communicating the health status of the bearers because carotenoids are efficient immunomodulators or antioxidants. However, the latter argument has been recently debated and the mechanisms by which carotenoids modulate immunity or oxidative balance are poorly known. We performed an experiment on wild-caught captive greenfinches, passerine birds with carotenoid-based plumage colouration, in order to test whether dietary carotenoid supplementation affects immune-stimulated oxidative burst of phagocytes in the whole blood and humoral immune response to a novel antigen, Brucella abortus (BA). Additionally, we tested whether immune stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affects blood carotenoid levels. We thus tested the effects of carotenoids on the oxidative burst of phagocytes under neutral conditions and during in vivo immune challenge. LPS injection depleted plasma carotenoids, indicating involvement of these phytochemicals in the immune response. However, we did not find any evidence that manipulation of carotenoid intake had modulated anti-BA antibody production, LPS-stimulated oxidative burst of phagocytes, or basal levels of circulating reactive oxygen species. This indicates that carotenoid intake does not affect endogenous production of reactive oxygen species by immune cells. This finding is consistent with the view that carotenoids are unlikely to provide a direct link between oxidative stress and colouration. However, it remains to be tested whether the oxidative burst of phagocytes induced in our experiment actually inflicts oxidative damage and whether carotenoids play a role in the attenuation of such potential damages."},{"title":"Moment-to-moment flight manoeuvres of the female yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti L.) in response to plumes of carbon dioxide and human skin odour","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3480","abstract":"Odours are crucial cues enabling female mosquitoes to orient to prospective hosts. However, their in-flight manoeuvres to host odours are virtually unknown. Here we analyzed in 3-D the video records of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes flying in a wind tunnel in response to host odour plumes that differed in spatial structure and composition. Following a brief (∼0.03 s) encounter with CO2, mosquitoes surged upwind and, in the absence of further encounters, counterturned without displacing upwind. These patterns resemble moth responses to encounter and loss of a filament of pheromone. Moreover, CO2 encounters induced a highly regular pattern of counterturning across the windline in the horizontal (crosswind) and vertical planes, causing the mosquito to transect repeatedly the area where CO2 was previously detected. However, despite the rapid changes across all three axes following an encounter with CO2, the angular velocities remained remarkably constant. This suggests that during these CO2-induced surges mosquitoes stabilize flight through sensors, such as the halteres and Johnston organs, sensitive to Coriolis forces. In contrast to the instantaneous responses of the mosquito CO2, a brief encounter with a filament of human skin odour did not induce a consistent change in mosquito flight. These differential responses were reflected in further experiments with broad plumes. A broad homogeneous plume of skin odour induced rapid upwind flight and source finding, whereas a broad filamentous plume of skin odour lowered activation rates, kinetic responses and source finding compared with homogeneous plumes. Apparently, yellow fever mosquitoes need longer continuous exposure to complex skin-odour blends to induce activation and source finding."},{"title":"Principles underlying chromatophore addition during maturation in the European cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3423","abstract":"The goal of this work was to identify some of the principles underlying chromatophore growth and development in the European cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis. One set of experiments used a regeneration model to follow the re-growth of black chromatophores for 30 days following excision of a small piece of fin tissue. A separate set of experiments tracked and analyzed the addition of new fin chromatophores during a month of normal, undisturbed growth. We also followed the development of individual chromatophores from their initial appearance to full maturation to determine whether their color type was fixed. Based on the results of these studies, we propose five guiding principles for chromatophore growth and maturation. (1) The three chromatophore cell types – black, reddish-brown and yellow – are present at different spatial frequencies in the cuttlefish fin. (2) During normal growth, new chromatophores are inserted at a higher spatial frequency than existing (control) chromatophores of the same color type. (3) In regenerating tissue, new black chromatophores are initially added at low spatial frequencies. As regeneration continues, new black chromatophores appear at increasing spatial frequencies until they are inserted at a spatial frequency higher than that observed in control tissue, similar to the way in which chromatophores were observed to be added in normally growing tissue. (4) All chromatophores first appear as pale orange cells and slowly darken into their respective color types without passing through intermediate color stages. (5) New black chromatophores undergo a doubling in size as they mature, while reddish-brown and yellow chromatophores do not grow at all after they are inserted in the dermis."},{"title":"Skin impulse excitation of spinal sensory neurons in developing Xenopus laevis (Daudin) tadpoles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3341","abstract":"Responses to gentle touch in young Xenopus tadpoles are mediated by spinal cord sensory Rohon–Beard neurons. Tadpoles also respond to noxious stimuli that elicit ‘skin impulses’, which propagate between epithelial cells over the whole body surface, somehow entering the CNS to generate a response. After hatching (∼48 h post-fertilization), skin impulse signals enter the CNS only via cranial nerves, but previous evidence suggested the possibility of direct entry to the spinal cord before this (∼24 h). We have used behavioural and electrophysiological methods to explore the developmental pattern of skin impulse entry into the spinal cord and the involvement of Rohon–Beard neurons. Lesioning confirmed that skin impulse signals can directly enter the spinal cord in young embryos, but access decreases over ∼12 h and disappears soon after hatching. Electrical recordings from central Rohon–Beard axons in young embryos showed firing in response to skin impulses. However, unit recordings from Rohon–Beard somata showed that individuals that responded to touch within a characteristic, localised receptive field did not fire to skin impulses, whereas others from similar locations responded reliably. Developmental loss of skin impulse access to the spinal cord mirrored the known spread of sensitivity to gentle touch as the peripheral mechanosensory endings of Rohon–Beard neurons mature. Together, these results suggest that Rohon–Beard neurons respond to skin impulses only while immature, providing a transitory route for skin impulses to excite the CNS. In this way, Rohon–Beard neurons would mediate responses first to noxious and then to localised, gentle touch stimuli as the neurons developed."},{"title":"Salt stress alters fluid and ion transport by Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster: evidence for phenotypic plasticity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3443","abstract":"Drosophila are tolerant of high levels of dietary salt and can provide a useful model for studies of the physiology of salt stress. The effects of NaCl- and KCl-rich diets on haemolymph ionoregulation and Malpighian tubule (MT) fluid secretion, Na+ and K+ secretion and transepithelial potential were examined in larval and adult Drosophila melanogaster. K+ concentrations in the haemolymph of adults reared on the KCl-rich (0.4 mol l–1) diet did not differ from the values for insects reared on the control diet. In the haemolymph of larvae reared on the K-rich diet, K+ concentrations increased from 23 to 75 mmol l–1 after 6 h, then returned to the control value within 48 h. Na+ concentrations in the haemolymph of adults or larvae reared for 1–7 days on the NaCl-rich (0.4 mol l–1) diet increased by ∼50% relative to values for insects reared on the control diet. Rates of secretion of fluid, Na+ and K+ by MTs isolated from larvae reared on the Na-rich diet for >6 h and bathed in control saline containing 20 mmol l–1 K+ did not differ from the values for tubules of larvae reared on the control diet. Evidence of phenotypic plasticity was seen in the response of MTs isolated from larvae reared on the K-rich diet for >6 h and bathed in saline containing 60 mmol l–1 K+; secretion of fluid and K+ increased by >50% relative to the values for tubules of larvae reared on the control diet. Secretion of fluid, Na+ and K+ increased when tubules were bathed in haemolymph collected from larvae reared on the Na- or K-rich diets. Secretion was further increased by addition of exogenous cAMP but not by addition of thapsigargin to the haemolymph. The results show that haemolymph ionoregulation in larvae reared on salt-rich diets involves both alterations in the basal secretion rates of Na+ and/or K+ as well as stimulatory effects of diuretic factors present in the haemolymph. The results suggest that such factors stimulate tubule fluid and ion secretion through increases in intracellular Ca2+ in response to salt stress."},{"title":"Biomechanics of octopedal locomotion: kinematic and kinetic analysis of the spider Grammostola mollicoma","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3433","abstract":"Despite the abundance of octapodal species and their evolutionary importance in originating terrestrial locomotion, the locomotion mechanics of spiders has received little attention so far. In this investigation we use inverse dynamics to study the locomotor performance of Grammostola mollicoma (18 g). Through 3-D kinematic measurements, the trajectory of the eight limbs and cephalothorax or abdomen allowed us to estimate the motion of the body centre of mass (COM) at different speeds. Classic mechanics of locomotion and multivariate analysis of several variables such as stride length and frequency, duty factor, mechanical external work and energy recovery, helped to identify two main gaits, a slow (speed <11 cm s–1) one and a fast one characterised by distinctive 3-D trajectories of COM. The total mechanical work (external + internal) calculated in the present study and metabolic data from the literature allowed us to estimate the locomotion efficiency of this species, which was less than 4%. Gait pattern due to alternating limb support, which generates asymmetrical COM trajectories and a small but consistent energy transfer between potential and kinetic energies of COM, is discussed both in terms of coordination indices and by referring to the octopod as formed by two quadrupeds in series. Analogies and differences of the newly obtained parameters with the allometric data and predictions are also illustrated."},{"title":"Extracoelenteric zooplankton feeding is a key mechanism of nutrient acquisition for the scleractinian coral Galaxea fascicularis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3351","abstract":"Internal and external feeding on zooplankton may provide scleractinian corals with important nutrients. However, the latter process has never been properly quantified. To quantify the dynamics of zooplankton capture, digestion and release for a scleractinian coral, we performed detailed video analyses of Galaxea fascicularis feeding on Artemia nauplii. A highly dynamic process of prey capture, digestion and release was observed. A single G. fascicularis polyp (N=3) captured 558±67 and released 383±75 Artemia nauplii over a 6 h interval. On average, 98.6% of prey captured was not ingested. Instead, prey items were clustered into aggregates that were digested externally by mesenterial filaments. In addition, we employed carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus analysis of zooplankton before and after digestion by G. fascicularis colonies (N=6). For total organic carbon, 43.1% (0.298±0.148 μg Artemia–1) was lost after 6 h of digestion. For total organic nitrogen, total organic phosphorus and orthophosphate (PO43–), these values were 51.3% (0.059±0.028 μg Artemia–1), 50.9% (0.009±0.004 μg Artemia–1) and 84.6% (0.0019±0.0008 μg Artemia–1), respectively. For extracoelenteric zooplankton feeding alone, total estimated nutrient inputs for G. fascicularis colonies were 76.5±0.0 μg organic carbon, 15.2±0.0 μg organic nitrogen, 2.3±0.2 μg organic phosphorus and 0.5±0.8 μg inorganic phosphorus per cm2 coral tissue per day. These values exceed calculations based on intracoelenteric feeding by up to two orders of magnitude. Our results demonstrate that extracoelenteric zooplankton feeding is a key mechanism of nutrient acquisition for a scleractinian coral. These results are of importance to coral aquaculture and our understanding of benthic–pelagic coupling on coral reefs."},{"title":"Role of the lateral line mechanosensory system in directionality of goldfish auditory evoked escape response","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3358","abstract":"Goldfish (Carassius auratus) escape responses to sudden auditory stimuli are mediated by a pair of reticulospinal neurons, the Mauthner (M-) cells, which integrate mechanosensory inputs from the inner ear and the lateral line (LL) to initiate a fast directional response away from the aversive stimulus. This behavior is context dependent; when near an obstruction the fish may rather turn towards the sound to avoid hitting the object. Mechanisms underlying this directionality remain unknown. Here we investigate the contribution of the LL system to auditory evoked escapes and provide behavioral evidence that it transmits stimulus – and environmental-dependent information that determines the initial response direction of the escape. We quantified escape latency, probability and directionality following abrupt sound stimuli before and after removal of the entire LL with 0.03 mmol l–1 cobalt chloride (CoCl2), 0.002% gentamicin or selective posterior LL nerve (pLLn) transection. CoCl2 significantly increased escape onset latency without affecting probability and reduced open field directionality from 77% to chance, 52%. This effect on directionality was also observed with gentamicin. Transection of the pLLn had no effect on directionality, indicating the anterior LL nerve (aLLn) afferents are more likely to transmit directional information to the M-cell. When the fish were near a wall, the error rate was quadrupled by both CoCl2 and pLLn transection. Visual elimination had no influence on directionality unless combined with LL elimination."},{"title":"Characteristics of the anterior lateral line nerve input to the Mauthner cell","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3368","abstract":"The goldfish Mauthner (M-) cells, a bilateral pair of reticulospinal neurons, initiate the auditory evoked escape behavior of teleosts. In an open field the fish reliably turns away from the sound source. This implies that the M-cells are capable of a decision-making process that requires the two cells to receive differential directional inputs. Recent studies have indicated that the lateral line (LL) system is necessary in the initial directionality of the escape. This information is thought to be transmitted to the M-cell by the anterior branch of the lateral line nerve (aLLn), which has a shorter conduction time then the posterior branch. This study is the first attempt to characterize the inputs from the aLLn to the M-cell. M-cell intracellular responses to aLLn stimulation indicate a fast monosynaptic input (0.80±0.03 ms) that has a small amplitude averaging 5.85±0.42 mV. This input is bilateral and has a significantly longer latency and smaller amplitude in the contralateral M-cell. Superimposed on the evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is a shunting inhibition with a delay of 1 ms, which is characteristic of other sensory inputs to the M-cell. Pharmacological manipulation and 50 Hz stimulation reveal a component of the evoked EPSP that is electrotonic, a property favoring speed of transmission. In addition, this input is localized to the lateral dendrite proximal to the inputs from the inner ear. The short latency of these inputs and their proximity to the posterior eighth nerve afferents indicate a crucial role for the aLLn in influencing the excitability and directionality of the M-cell."},{"title":"Differential segmental strain during active lengthening in a large biarticular thigh muscle during running","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3386","abstract":"The iliotibialis lateralis pars postacetabularis (ILPO) is the largest muscle in the hindlimb of the guinea fowl and is thought to play an important role during the stance phase of running, both absorbing and producing work. Using sonomicrometry and electromyography, we examined whether the ILPO experiences differential strain between proximal, central and distal portions of the posterior fascicles. When the ILPO is being lengthened while active, the distal portion was found to lengthen significantly more than either the proximal or central portions of the muscle. Our data support the hypothesis that the distal segment lengthened farther and faster because it began activity at shorter sarcomere lengths on the ascending limb of the length–tension curve. Probably because of the self-stabilizing effects of operating on the ascending limb of the length–tension curve, all segments reached the end of lengthening and started shortening at the same sarcomere length. During shortening, this similarity in sarcomere length among the segments was maintained, as predicted from force–velocity effects, and shortening strain was similar in all segments. The differential active strain during active lengthening is thus ultimately determined by differences in strain during the passive portion of the cycle. The sarcomere lengths of all segments of the fascicles were similar at the end of active shortening, but after the passive portion of the cycle the distal segment was shorter. Differential strain in the segments during the passive portion of the cycle may be caused by differential joint excursions at the knee and hip acting on the ends of the muscle and being transmitted differentially by the passive visco-elastic properties of the muscle. Alternatively, the differential passive strain could be due to the action of active or passive muscles in the thigh that transmit force to the IPLO in shear. Based on basic sarcomere dynamics we predict that differential strain is more likely to occur in muscles undergoing active lengthening at the beginning of contraction than those undergoing only shortening."},{"title":"Mechanisms producing coordinated function across the breadth of a large biarticular thigh muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3396","abstract":"We examined the hypothesis that structural features of the iliotibialis lateralis pars postacetabularis (ILPO) in guinea fowl allow this large muscle to maintain equivalent function along its anterior–posterior axis. The ILPO, the largest muscle in the hindlimb of the guinea fowl, is a hip and knee extensor. The fascicles of the ILPO originate across a broad region of the ilium and ischium posterior to the hip. Its long posterior fascicles span the length of the thigh and insert directly on the patellar tendon complex. However, its anterior fascicles are shorter and insert on a narrow aponeurosis that forms a tendinous band along the anterior edge of the muscle and is connected distally to the patellar tendon. The biarticular ILPO is actively lengthened and then actively shortened during stance. The moment arm of the fascicles at the hip increases along the anterior to posterior axis, whereas the moment arm at the knee is constant for all fascicles. Using electromyography and sonomicrometry, we examined the activity and strain of posterior and anterior fascicles of the ILPO. The activation was not significantly different in the anterior and posterior fascicles. Although we found significant differences in active lengthening and shortening strain between the anterior and posterior fascicles, the differences were small. The majority of shortening strain is caused by hip extension and the inverse relationship between hip moment arm and fascicle length along the anterior–posterior axis was found to have a major role in ensuring similar shortening strain. However, because the knee moment arm is the same for all fascicles, knee flexion in early stance was predicted to produce much larger lengthening strains in the short anterior fascicles than our measured values at this location. We propose that active lengthening of the anterior fascicles was lower than predicted because the aponeurotic tendon of insertion of the anterior fascicles was stretched and only a portion of the lengthening had to be accommodated by the active muscle fascicles."},{"title":"Function of a large biarticular hip and knee extensor during walking and running in guinea fowl (Numida meleagris)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3405","abstract":"Physiological and anatomical evidence suggests that in birds the iliotibialis lateralis pars postacetabularis (ILPO) is functionally important for running. Incorporating regional information, we estimated the mean sarcomere strain trajectory and electromyographic (EMG) amplitude of the ILPO during level and incline walking and running. Using these data and data in the literature of muscle energy use, we examined three hypotheses: (1) active lengthening will occur on the ascending limb of the length–tension curve to avoid potential damage caused by stretch on the descending limb; (2) the active strain cycle will shift to favor active shortening when the birds run uphill and shortening will occur on the plateau and shallow ascending limb of the length–tension curve; and (3) measures of EMG intensity will correlate with energy use when the mechanical function of the muscle is similar. Supporting the first hypothesis, we found that the mean sarcomere lengths at the end of active lengthening during level locomotion were smaller than the predicted length at the start of the plateau of the length–tension curve. Supporting the second hypothesis, the magnitude of active lengthening decreased with increasing slope, whereas active shortening increased. In evaluating the relationship between EMG amplitude and energy use (hypothesis 3), we found that although increases in EMG intensity with speed, slope and loading were positively correlated with muscle energy use, the quantitative relationships between these variables differed greatly under different conditions. The relative changes in EMG intensity and energy use by the muscle probably varied because of changes in the mechanical function of the muscle that altered the ratio of muscle energy use to active muscle volume. Considering the overall function of the cycle of active lengthening and shortening of the fascicles of the ILPO, we conclude that the function of active lengthening is unlikely to be energy conservation and may instead be related to promoting stability at the knee. The work required to lengthen the ILPO during stance is provided by co-contracting knee flexors. We suggest that this potentially energetically expensive co-contraction serves to stabilize the knee in early stance by increasing the mechanical impedance of the joint."},{"title":"Effect of cuticular abrasion and recovery on water loss rates in queens of the desert harvester ant Messor pergandei","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3495","abstract":"Factors that affect water loss rates (WLRs) are poorly known for organisms in natural habitats. Seed-harvester ant queens provide an ideal system for examining such factors because WLRs for mated queens excavated from their incipient nests are twofold to threefold higher than those of alate queens. Indirect data suggest that this increase results from soil particles abrading the cuticle during nest excavation. This study provides direct support for the cuticle abrasion hypothesis by measuring total mass-specific WLRs, cuticular abrasion, cuticular transpiration, respiratory water loss and metabolic rate for queens of the ant Messor pergandei at three stages: unmated alate queens, newly mated dealate queens (undug foundresses) and mated queens excavated from their incipient nest (dug foundresses); in addition we examined these processes in artificially abraded alate queens. Alate queens had low WLRs and low levels of cuticle abrasion, whereas dug foundresses had high WLRs and high levels of cuticle abrasion. Total WLR and cuticular transpiration were lowest for alate queens, intermediate for undug foundresses and highest for dug foundresses. Respiratory water loss contributed ∼10% of the total WLR and was lower for alate queens and undug foundresses than for dug foundresses. Metabolic rate did not vary across stages. Total WLR and cuticular transpiration of artificially abraded alate queens increased, whereas respiratory water loss and metabolic rate were unaffected. Overall, increased cuticular transpiration accounted for essentially all the increased total water loss in undug and dug foundresses and artificially abraded queens. Artificially abraded queens and dug foundresses showed partial recovery after 14 days."},{"title":"No evidence for DPOAEs in the mechanical motion of the locust tympanum","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3165","abstract":"Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are present in non-linear hearing organs, and for low-intensity sounds are a by-product of active processes. In vertebrate ears they are considered to be due to hair cell amplification of sound in the cochlea; however, certain animals lacking a cochlea and hair cells are also reported to be capable of DPOAEs. In the Insecta, DPOAEs have been recorded from the locust auditory organ. However, the site of generation of these DPOAEs and the physiological mechanisms causing their presence in the locust ear are not yet understood, despite there being a number of potential places in the tympanal organ that could be capable of generating DPOAEs. This study aimed to record locust tympanal membrane vibration using a laser Doppler vibrometer in order to identify a distinct place of DPOAE generation on the membrane. Two species of locust were investigated over a range of frequencies and levels of acoustic stimulus, mirroring earlier acoustic recording studies; however, the current experiments were carried out in an open acoustic system. The laser measurements did not find any evidence of mechanical motion on the tympanal membrane related to the expected DPOAE frequencies. The results of the current study therefore could not confirm the presence of DPOAEs in the locust ear through the mechanics of the tympanal membrane. Experiments were also carried out to test how membrane behaviour altered when the animals were in a state of hypoxia, as this was previously found to decrease DPOAE magnitude, suggesting a metabolic sensitivity. However, hypoxia did not have any significant effect on the membrane mechanics. The location of the mechanical generation of DPOAEs in the locust's ear, and therefore the basis for the related physiological mechanisms, thus remains unknown."},{"title":"Aerobic capacity in wild satin bowerbirds: repeatability and effects of age, sex and condition","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3186","abstract":"Individual variation in aerobic capacity has been extensively studied, especially with respect to condition, maturity or pathogen infection, and to gain insights into mechanistic foundations of performance.

Morphological variation ranges from runner-like forms with sparse polyp and stolon development to sheet-like forms with dense polyp and stolon development. These forms have typically been considered in a foraging context, consistent with a focus on rates of polyp development relative to stolon elongation. At the same time, rates of stolon regression can affect this morphological variation; several aspects of regression were investigated in this context. More sheet-like forms were produced by periodic peroxide treatment, which induced high rates of stolon regression. Caspase inhibitors altered the effects of regression induced by peroxide or vitamin C. These inhibitors generally diminished physical regression and the abundance of associated reactive oxygen species. Caspase inhibitors also altered cellular ultrastructure, resulting in features suggestive of necrosis rather than apoptosis. At the same time, caspase inhibitors had little effect on reactive nitrogen species that are also associated with regression. Although regression is most easily triggered by pharmacological perturbations related to reactive oxygen species (e.g. peroxide or vitamin C), a variety of environmental effects, particularly restricted environments and an interaction between feeding and temperature, can also induce regression. Stolon regression may thus be a factor contributing to natural variation between runners and sheets."},{"title":"The development of endotoxin tolerance, and the role of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function and glucocorticoids in Pekin ducks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/20/3378","abstract":"Endotoxin tolerance represents a state of abated immunological responsiveness to pyrogens, which, in mammals, leads to the decline or abolition of the fever response. The development of endotoxin tolerance in birds is not well understood; consequently, the impact of repeated pathogenic exposure on the avian febrile response, and thus on the ability of birds to fight recurrent infection, is not known. We determined the effect of repeated injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the febrile response of Pekin ducks. We gave ducks five injections of LPS, spaced 1, 4 or 10 days apart, and recorded their core body temperature with abdominally implanted temperature data loggers. Once we established that Pekin ducks developed endotoxin tolerance, we investigated the effect of repeated injections of LPS on the central and peripheral segments of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in an attempt to elucidate the role of glucocorticoids in the modulation of the febrile response during the tolerant period. When our ducks became tolerant to LPS, they had significantly higher basal levels of plasma corticosterone (CORT, the principal glucocorticoid in birds), and their HPA response to treatment with LPS was blunted. We propose that the augmented levels of basal plasma CORT resulted from sensitized HPA function, and this, in turn, contributed to the development of endotoxin tolerance. Regulation of the circulating level of CORT might be a possible target for the re-establishment of appropriate immune responses in birds."},{"title":"Spectral and duration sensitivity to light-at-night in ‘blind’ and sighted rodent species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3206","abstract":"Light-at-night (LAN) has become a defining feature of human and animal ecosystems and may possibly compromise human and animal physiology and health.

Overall, the blue light elicited the greatest effects on the biological markers of M. socialis, whereas similar effects were detected for S. ehrenbergi in response to red light. The increasing LAN-AD resulted in a dose-dependent decrement of all markers tested, except of stress hormones, which showed a direct positive correlation with LAN-AD. Our results suggest that: (1) photoperiod is an important cue for entraining physiological functions in the ‘blind’ S. ehrenbergi, which is essentially characterized by red-shifted sensitivity compared with the blue-shifted sensitivity detected for the sighted counterpart species, and (2) there is a strong association between LAN of the appropriate wavelength and adrenal endocrine responses, suggesting that LAN is a potential environmental stressor."},{"title":"Scaling of resting and maximum hopping metabolic rate throughout the life cycle of the locust Locusta migratoria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3218","abstract":"The hemimetabolous migratory locust Locusta migratoria progresses through five instars to the adult, increasing in size from 0.02 to 0.95 g, a 45-fold change.

Increasing body mass by 20–45% with attached weights did not increase mass-specific <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/214/19/3218/embed/inline-graphic-10.gif\"/> significantly at any life stage, although mean mass-specific hopping <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/214/19/3218/embed/inline-graphic-11.gif\"/> was slightly higher (ca. 8%) when juvenile data were pooled. The allometric exponents for all measures of metabolic rate are much greater than 0.75, and therefore do not support West, Brown and Enquist's optimised fractal network model, which predicts that metabolism scales with a ¾-power exponent owing to limitations in the rate at which resources can be transported within the body."},{"title":"Regulation of bat echolocation pulse acoustics by striatal dopamine","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3238","abstract":"The ability to control the bandwidth, amplitude and duration of echolocation pulses is a crucial aspect of echolocation performance but few details are known about the neural mechanisms underlying the control of these voice parameters in any mammal. The basal ganglia (BG) are a suite of forebrain nuclei centrally involved in sensory-motor control and are characterized by their dependence on dopamine. We hypothesized that pharmacological manipulation of brain dopamine levels could reveal how BG circuits might influence the acoustic structure of bat echolocation pulses. A single intraperitoneal injection of a low dose (5 mg kg–1) of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPTP), which selectively targets dopamine-producing cells of the substantia nigra, produced a rapid degradation in pulse acoustic structure and eliminated the bat's ability to make compensatory changes in pulse amplitude in response to background noise, i.e. the Lombard response. However, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements of striatal dopamine concentrations revealed that the main effect of MPTP was a fourfold increase rather than the predicted decrease in striatal dopamine levels. After first using autoradiographic methods to confirm the presence and location of D1- and D2-type dopamine receptors in the bat striatum, systemic injections of receptor subtype-specific agonists showed that MPTP's effects on pulse acoustics were mimicked by a D2-type dopamine receptor agonist (Quinpirole) but not by a D1-type dopamine receptor agonist (SKF82958). The results suggest that BG circuits have the capacity to influence echolocation pulse acoustics, particularly via D2-type dopamine receptor-mediated pathways, and may therefore represent an important mechanism for vocal control in bats."},{"title":"Peripheral injury induces long-term sensitization of defensive responses to visual and tactile stimuli in the squid Loligo pealeii, Lesueur 1821","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3173","abstract":"Survivable injuries are a common yet costly experience. The ability to sense and respond to noxious stimuli is an almost universal trait, and prolonged behavioral alterations, including sensitization to touch and other stimuli, may function to ameliorate fitness costs associated with injury. Cephalopods can modify their behavior by learned association with noxious electric shock, but non-associative alterations of behavioral responses after tissue injury have not been studied. The aim of this study was to make the first systematic investigations in any cephalopod of behavioral responses and alterations elicited by explicit, minor injury. By testing responsiveness in the longfin squid, Loligo pealeii, to the approach and contact of an innocuous filament applied to different parts of the body both before and after injury to the distal third of one arm, we show that a cephalopod expresses behavioral alterations persisting for at least 2 days after injury. These alterations parallel forms of nociceptive plasticity in other animals, including general and site-specific sensitization to tactile stimuli. A novel finding is that hyper-responsiveness after injury extends to visual stimuli. Injured squid are more likely to employ crypsis than escape in response to an approaching visual stimulus shortly after injury, but initiate escape earlier and continue escape behaviors for longer when tested from 1 to 48 h after injury. Injury failed to elicit overt wound-directed behavior (e.g. grooming) or change hunting success. Our results show that long-lasting nociceptive sensitization occurs in cephalopods, and suggest that it may function to reduce predation risk after injury."},{"title":"Symmorphosis and the insect respiratory system: allometric variation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3225","abstract":"Taylor and Weibel's theory of symmorphosis predicts that structures of the respiratory system are matched to maximum functional requirements with minimal excess capacity. We tested this hypothesis in the respiratory system of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, by comparing the aerobic capacity of the jumping muscles with the morphology of the oxygen cascade in the hopping legs using an intraspecific allometric analysis of different body mass (Mb) at selected juvenile life stages. The maximum oxygen consumption rate of the hopping muscle during jumping exercise scales as Mb1.02±0.02, which parallels the scaling of mitochondrial volume in the hopping muscle, Mb1.02±0.08, and the total surface area of inner mitochondrial membrane, Mb0.99±0.10. Likewise, at the oxygen supply end of the insect respiratory system, there is congruence between the aerobic capacity of the hopping muscle and the total volume of tracheoles in the hopping muscle, Mb0.99±0.16, the total inner surface area of the tracheoles, Mb0.99±0.16, and the anatomical radial diffusing capacity of the tracheoles, Mb0.99±0.18. Therefore, the principles of symmorphosis are upheld at each step of the oxygen cascade in the respiratory system of the migratory locust."},{"title":"Intra-retinal variation of opsin gene expression in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3248","abstract":"Although behavioural experiments demonstrate that colouration influences mate choice in many species, a complete understanding of this form of signalling requires information about colour vision in the species under investigation. The guppy (Poecilia reticulata) has become a model species for the study of colour-based sexual selection. To investigate the role of opsin gene duplication and divergence in the evolution of colour-based mate choice, we used in situ hybridization to determine where the guppy's nine cone opsins are expressed in the retina. Long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsins were more abundant in the dorsal retina than in the ventral retina. One of the middle wavelength-sensitive opsins (RH2-1) exhibited the opposite pattern, while the other middle wavelength-sensitive opsin (RH2-2) and the short wavelength-sensitive opsins (SWS1, SWS2A and SWS2B) were expressed throughout the retina. We also found variation in LWS opsin expression among individuals. These observations suggest that regions of the guppy retina are specialized with respect to wavelength discrimination and/or sensitivity. Intra-retinal variability in opsin expression, which has been observed in several fish species, might be an adaptation to variation in the strength and spectral composition of light entering the eye from above and below. The discovery that opsin expression varies in the guppy retina may motivate new behavioural experiments designed to study its role in mate choice."},{"title":"Comparative gene expression profiles for highly similar aggressive phenotypes in male and female cichlid fishes (Julidochromis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3269","abstract":"Julidochromis marlieri and Julidochromis transcriptus are two closely related Tanganyikan cichlids that have evolved different behavior and mating strategies since they diverged from their common ancestor. While J. transcriptus follows the ancestral pattern of male dominance, male-biased sexual size dimorphism and territoriality, the pattern is reversed in J. marlieri. In J. marlieri, females show all of these behavioral and morphological characteristics. This raises the question of whether female J. marlieri achieve the dominant phenotype by expressing the same genes as J. transcriptus males or whether novel brain gene expression patterns have evolved to produce a similar behavioral phenotype in the females of J. marlieri. This study used cDNA microarrays to investigate whether female J. marlieri and male J. transcriptus show conserved or divergent patterns of brain gene expression. Analysis of microarray data in both species showed certain gene expression patterns associated with sex role independent of gonadal sex and, to a lesser extent, gene expression patterns associated with sex independent of sex role. In general, these data suggest that while there has been substantial divergence in gene expression patterns between J. transcriptus and J. marlieri, we can detect a highly significant overlap for a core set of genes related to aggression in both species. These results suggest that the proximate mechanisms regulating aggressive behavior in J. transcriptus and J. marlieri may be shared."},{"title":"Chronic hypoxia stimulates an enhanced response to immune challenge without evidence of an energetic tradeoff","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3255","abstract":"There is broad interest in whether there is a tradeoff between energy metabolism and immune function, and how stress affects immune function. Under hypoxic stress, maximal aerobic metabolism is limited, and other aspects of energy metabolism of animals may be altered as well. Although acute hypoxia appears to enhance certain immune responses, the effects of chronic hypoxia on immune function are largely unstudied. We tested: (1) whether chronic hypoxia affects immune function and (2) whether hypoxia affects the metabolic cost of immune function. First, flow cytometry was used to monitor the peripheral blood immunophenotype of mice over the course of 36 days of hypoxic exposure. Second, hypoxic and normoxic mice were subjected to an adaptive immune challenge via keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or to an innate immune challenge via lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The resting metabolic rates of mice in all immune challenge treatments were also measured. Although hypoxia had little effect on the peripheral blood immunophenotype, hypoxic mice challenged with KLH or LPS had enhanced immunological responses in the form of higher antibody titers or increased TNF-α production, respectively. Initially, mice exposed to hypoxia had lower metabolic rates, but this response was transitory and resting metabolic rates were normal by the end of the experiment. There was no effect of either immune challenge on resting metabolic rate, suggesting that mounting either the acute phase response or a humoral response is not as energetically expensive as previously thought. In addition, our results suggest that immune responses to chronic and acute hypoxia are concordant. Both forms of hypoxia appear to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses."},{"title":"Roles of biogenic amines in regulating bioluminescence in the Australian glowworm Arachnocampa flava","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3286","abstract":"The glowworm Arachnocampa flava is a carnivorous fly larva (Diptera) that uses light to attract prey into its web. The light organ is derived from cells of the Malpighian tubules, representing a bioluminescence system that is unique to the genus. Bioluminescence is modulated through the night although light levels change quite slowly compared with the flashing of the better-known fireflies (Coleoptera). The existing model for the neural regulation of bioluminescence in Arachnocampa, based on use of anaesthetics and ligations, is that bioluminescence is actively repressed during the non-glowing phase and the repression is partially released during the bioluminescence phase. The effect of the anaesthetic, carbon dioxide, on the isolated light organ from the present study indicates that the repression is at least partially mediated at the light organ itself rather than less directly through the central nervous system. Blocking of neural signals from the central nervous system through ligation leads to uncontrolled release of bioluminescence but light is emitted at relatively low levels compared with under anaesthesia. Candidate biogenic amines were introduced by several methods: feeding prey items injected with test solution, injecting the whole larva, injecting a ligated section containing the light organ or bathing the isolated light organ in test solution. Using these methods, dopamine, serotonin and tyramine do not affect bioluminescence output. Exposure to elevated levels of octopamine via feeding, injection or bathing of the isolated light organ indicates that it is involved in the regulation of repression. Administration of the octopamine antagonists phentolamine or mianserin results in very high bioluminescence output levels, similar to the effect of anaesthetics, but only mianserin acts directly on the light organ."},{"title":"Social control of unreliable signals of strength in male but not female crayfish, Cherax destructor","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3294","abstract":"The maintenance of unreliable signals within animal populations remains a highly controversial subject in studies of animal communication. Crustaceans are an ideal group for studying unreliable signals of strength because their chela muscles are cryptically concealed beneath an exoskeleton, making it difficult for competitors to visually assess an opponent's strength. In this study, we examined the importance of social avenues for mediating the possible advantages gained by unreliable signals of strength in crustaceans. To do this, we investigated the factors that determine social dominance and the relative importance of signalling and fighting during aggressive encounters in male and female freshwater crayfish, Cherax destructor. Like other species of crayfish, we expected substantial variation in weapon force for a given weapon size, making the assessment of actual fighting ability of an opponent difficult from signalling alone. In addition, we expected fighting would be used to ensure that individuals that are weak for their signal (i.e. chela) size would not achieve higher than expected dominance. For both male and female C. destructor, we found large variation in the actual force of their chela for any given weapon size, indicating that it is difficult for competitors to accurately assess an opponent's force on signal size alone. For males, these unreliable signals of strength were controlled socially through increased levels of fighting and a decreased reliance on signalling, thus directly limiting the benefits accrued to individuals employing high-quality signals (large chelae) with only low resource holding potential. However, in contrast to our predictions, we found that females primarily relied on signalling to settle disputes, resulting in unreliable signals of strength being routinely used to establish dominance. The reliance by females on unreliable signals to determine dominance highlights our poor current understanding of the prevalence and distribution of dishonesty in animal communication."},{"title":"Magnetic orientation of migratory robins, Erithacus rubecula, under long-wavelength light","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3096","abstract":"The avian magnetic compass is an inclination compass that appears to be based on radical pair processes. It requires light from the short-wavelength range of the spectrum up to 565 nm green light; under longer wavelengths, birds are disoriented. When pre-exposed to longer wavelengths for 1 h, however, they show oriented behavior. This orientation is analyzed under 582 nm yellow light and 645 nm red light in the present study: while the birds in spring prefer northerly directions, they do not show southerly tendencies in autumn. Inversion of the vertical component does not have an effect whereas reversal of the horizontal component leads to a corresponding shift, indicating that a polar response to the magnetic field is involved. Oscillating magnetic fields in the MHz range do not affect the behavior but anesthesia of the upper beak causes disorientation. This indicates that the magnetic information is no longer provided by the radical pair mechanism in the eye but by the magnetite-based receptors in the skin of the beak. Exposure to long-wavelength light thus does not expand the spectral range in which the magnetic compass operates but instead causes a different mechanism to take over and control orientation."},{"title":"Long-term olfactory memories are stabilised via protein synthesis in Camponotus fellah ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3300","abstract":"Ants exhibit impressive olfactory learning abilities. Operant protocols in which ants freely choose between rewarded and non-rewarded odours have been used to characterise associative olfactory learning and memory. Yet, this approach precludes the use of invasive methods allowing the dissection of molecular bases of learning and memory. An open question is whether the memories formed upon olfactory learning that are retrievable several days after training are indeed based on de novo protein synthesis. Here, we addressed this question in the ant Camponotus fellah using a conditioning protocol in which individually harnessed ants learn an association between odour and reward. When the antennae of an ant are stimulated with sucrose solution, the insect extends its maxilla–labium to absorb the solution (maxilla–labium extension response). We differentially conditioned ants to discriminate between two long-chain hydrocarbons, one paired with sucrose and the other with quinine solution. Differential conditioning leads to the formation of a long-term memory retrievable at least 72 h after training. Long-term memory consolidation was impaired by the ingestion of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis blocker, prior to conditioning. Cycloheximide did not impair acquisition of either short-term memory (10 min) or early and late mid-term memories (1 or 12 h). These results show that, upon olfactory learning, ants form different memories with variable molecular bases. While short- and mid-term memories do not require protein synthesis, long-term memories are stabilised via protein synthesis. Our behavioural protocol opens interesting research avenues to explore the cellular and molecular bases of olfactory learning and memory in ants."},{"title":"Fatigue-related adaptations in muscle coordination during a cyclic exercise in humans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3305","abstract":"Muscle fatigue is an exercise-induced reduction in the capability of a muscle to generate force. A possible strategy to counteract the effects of fatigue is to modify muscle coordination. We designed this study to quantify the effect of fatigue on muscle coordination during a cyclic exercise involving numerous muscles. Nine human subjects were tested during a constant-load rowing exercise (mean power output: 217.9±32.4 W) performed until task failure. The forces exerted at the handle and the foot-stretcher were measured continuously and were synchronized with surface electromyographic (EMG) signals measured in 23 muscles. In addition to a classical analysis of individual EMG data (EMG profile and EMG activity level), a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm was used to identify the muscle synergies at the start and the end of the test. Among the 23 muscles tested, 16 showed no change in their mean activity level across the rowing cycle, five (biceps femoris, gluteus maximus, semitendinosus, trapezius medius and vastus medialis) showed a significant increase and two (gastrocnemius lateralis and longissimus) showed a significant decrease. We found no change in the number of synergies during the fatiguing test, i.e. three synergies accounted for more than 90% of variance accounted for at the start (92.4±1.5%) and at the end (91.0±1.8%) of the exercise. Very slight modifications at the level of individual EMG profiles, synergy activation coefficients and muscle synergy vectors were observed. These results suggest that fatigue during a cyclic task preferentially induces an adaptation in muscle activity level rather than changes in the modular organization of the muscle coordination."},{"title":"Forelimb kinematics and motor patterns of swimming loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta): are motor patterns conserved in the evolution of new locomotor strategies?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3314","abstract":"Novel functions in animals may evolve through changes in morphology, muscle activity or a combination of both. The idea that new functions or behavior can arise solely through changes in structure, without concurrent changes in the patterns of muscle activity that control movement of those structures, has been formalized as the neuromotor conservation hypothesis. In vertebrate locomotor systems, evidence for neuromotor conservation is found across evolutionary transitions in the behavior of terrestrial species, and in evolutionary transitions from terrestrial species to flying species. However, evolutionary transitions in the locomotion of aquatic species have received little comparable study to determine whether changes in morphology and muscle function were coordinated through the evolution of new locomotor behavior. To evaluate the potential for neuromotor conservation in an ancient aquatic system, we quantified forelimb kinematics and muscle activity during swimming in the loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta. Loggerhead forelimbs are hypertrophied into wing-like flippers that produce thrust via dorsoventral forelimb flapping. We compared kinematic and motor patterns from loggerheads with previous data from the red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta, a generalized freshwater species exhibiting unspecialized forelimb morphology and anteroposterior rowing motions during swimming. For some forelimb muscles, comparisons between C. caretta and T. scripta support neuromotor conservation; for example, the coracobrachialis and the latissimus dorsi show similar activation patterns. However, other muscles (deltoideus, pectoralis and triceps) do not show neuromotor conservation; for example, the deltoideus changes dramatically from a limb protractor/elevator in sliders to a joint stabilizer in loggerheads. Thus, during the evolution of flapping in sea turtles, drastic restructuring of the forelimb was accompanied by both conservation and evolutionary novelty in limb motor patterns."},{"title":"Movement and function of the pectoral fins of the larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) during slow swimming","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3111","abstract":"Pectoral fins are known to play important roles in swimming for many adult fish; however, their functions in fish larvae are unclear. We examined routine pectoral fin movement during rhythmic forward swimming and used genetic ablation to test hypotheses of fin function in larval zebrafish. Fins were active throughout bouts of slow swimming. Initiation was characterized by asymmetric fin abduction that transitioned to alternating rhythmic movement with first fin adduction. During subsequent swimming, fin beat amplitude decreased while tail beat amplitude increased over swimming speeds ranging from 1.47 to 4.56 body lengths per second. There was no change in fin or tail beat frequency with speed (means ± s.d.: 28.2±3.5 and 29.6±1.9 Hz, respectively). To examine potential roles of the pectoral fins in swimming, we compared the kinematics of finless larvae generated with a morpholino knockdown of the gene fgf24 to those of normal fish. Pectoral fins were not required for initiation nor did they significantly impact forward rhythmic swimming. We investigated an alternative hypothesis that the fins function in respiration. Dye visualization demonstrated that pectoral fin beats bring distant fluid toward the body and move it caudally behind the fins, disrupting the boundary layer along the body's surface, a major site of oxygen absorption in larvae. Larval zebrafish also demonstrated more fin beating in low oxygen conditions. Our data reject the hypothesis that the pectoral fins of larval zebrafish have a locomotor function during slow, forward locomotion, but are consistent with the hypothesis that the fins have a respiratory function."},{"title":"Behavioural and kinematic components of the fast-start escape response in fish: individual variation and temporal repeatability","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3102","abstract":"Inter-individual variation in physiological performance traits, which is stable over time, can be of potential ecological and evolutionary significance. The fish escape response is interesting in this regard because it is a performance trait for which inter-individual variation may determine individual survival. The temporal stability of such variation is, however, largely unexplored. We quantified individual variation of various components of the escape response in a population of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), considering both non-locomotor (responsiveness and latency) and locomotor (speed, acceleration, turning rate, turning angle and distance travelled in a fixed time, Desc) variables. We assessed whether variation in performance was temporally stable and we searched for any trade-offs among the components of the response that might explain why the variation persisted in the population. The coefficient of variation was high for all components, from 23% for turning rate to 41% for Desc, highlighting the non-stereotypic nature of the response. Individual performance for all variables was significantly repeatable over five sequential responses at 30 min intervals, and also repeatable after a 30 day interval for most of the components. This indicates that the variation is intrinsic to the individuals, but there was no evidence for trade-offs amongst the components of the response, suggesting that, if trade-offs exist, they must be against other ecologically important behavioural or performance traits."},{"title":"Developmental expression of calcium transport proteins in extraembryonic membranes of oviparous and viviparous Zootoca vivipara (Lacertilia, Lacertidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/2999","abstract":"The eggshell of oviparous lizards is a significant source of calcium for embryos, whereas the eggshell of viviparous lizards, when present, contains little calcium. In view of the potential cost to embryonic nutrition occasioned by the loss of eggshell calcium, the large number of independent origins of viviparity among lizards is surprising. Concomitant evolution of viviparity and calcium placentotrophy would ameliorate the loss of eggshell calcium, but a mechanism linking these events has yet to be discovered. Zootoca vivipara, a lizard with geographic variation in its mode of parity, is an excellent model for studying mechanisms of calcium transport to oviparous and viviparous embryos because each is highly dependent on calcium secreted by the uterus (eggshell or placenta) and ontogenetic patterns of embryonic calcium mobilization are similar. We compared developmental expression of the calcium transport protein calbindin-D28K in yolk splanchnopleure and chorioallantoic membranes of oviparous and viviparous embryos to test the hypothesis that the mechanism of calcium transport does not differ between modes of parity. We found that the ontogenetic pattern of protein expression is similar between reproductive modes and is correlated with calcium uptake from yolk and either eggshell or placenta. Calbindin-D28K is localized in the chorionic epithelium of embryos of both reproductive modes. These findings suggest that the embryonic calcium transport machinery is conserved in the transition between reproductive modes and that an adaptation of oviparous embryos for calcium uptake from eggshells functions similarly to transport calcium directly from uterine secretions."},{"title":"Hypoxia-induced mobilization of stored triglycerides in the euryoxic goby Gillichthys mirabilis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3005","abstract":"Environmental hypoxia is a common challenge that many aquatic organisms experience in their habitat.

Gene expression data revealed that pathways associated with triglyceride hydrolysis were upregulated by hypoxia whereas pathways associated with triglyceride synthesis were downregulated. This finding was supported by tissue histology, which showed that the size of hepatic lipid droplets declined visibly during exposure to hypoxia. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance analysis confirmed the mobilization of hepatic triglycerides, which declined 2.7-fold after 5 days of hypoxia. The enzyme, adipose triglyceride lipase, was implicated in the mobilization of triglycerides because its expression increased at the level of both transcript and protein.

Here, we report the cloning and characterization of jShaw1, the first Kv3 isolated from a cnidarian, the jellyfish Polyorchis penicillatus, in comparison with mouse Kv3.1 and Kv3.2. Using a two-electrode voltage clamp on Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the channels, we compared steady-state and kinetic properties of macroscopic currents. jShaw1 is fast activating, and opens at potentials approximately 40 mV more hyperpolarized than the mouse Kv3 channels. There is an inverse relationship between the number of positive charges on the voltage sensor and the half-activation voltage of the channel, contrary to what would be expected with the simplest model of voltage sensitivity. jShaw1 has kinetic characteristics that are substantially different from the mammalian Kv3 channels, including a much lower sensitivity of early activation rates to incremental voltage changes, and a much faster voltage-dependent transition in the last stages of opening. jShaw1 opening kinetics were affected little by pre-depolarization voltage, in contrast to both mouse channels. Similar to the mouse channels, jShaw1 was half-blocked by 0.7 mmol l–1 tetraethyl ammonium and 5 mmol l–1 4-aminopyridine. Comparison of sequence and functional properties of jShaw1 with the mouse and other reported Kv3 channels helps to illuminate the general relationship between amino acid sequence and electrophysiological activity in this channel family."},{"title":"The spatial and temporal patterns of odors sampled by lobsters and crabs in a turbulent plume","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3138","abstract":"Odors are dispersed across aquatic habitats by turbulent water flow as filamentous, intermittent plumes. Many crustaceans sniff (take discrete samples of ambient water and the odors it carries) by flicking their olfactory antennules. We used planar laser-induced fluorescence to investigate how flicking antennules of different morphologies (long antennules of spiny lobsters, Panulirus argus; short antennules of blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus) sample fluctuating odor signals at different positions in a turbulent odor plume in a flume to determine whether the patterns of concentrations captured can provide information about an animal's position relative to the odor source. Lobster antennules intercept odors during a greater percentage of flicks and encounter higher peak concentrations than do crab antennules, but because crabs flick at higher frequency, the duration of odor-free gaps between encountered odor pulses is similar. For flicking antennules there were longer time gaps between odor encounters as the downstream distance to the odor source decreases, but shorter gaps along the plume centerline than near the edge. In contrast to the case for antennule flicking, almost all odor-free gaps were <500 ms at all positions in the plume if concentration was measured continuously at the same height as the antennules. Variance in concentration is lower and mean concentration is greater near the substratum, where leg chemosensors continuously sample the plume, than in the water where antennules sniff. Concentrations sampled by legs increase as an animal nears an odor source, but decrease for antennules. Both legs and antennules encounter higher concentrations near the centerline than at the edge of the plume."},{"title":"Evolution of limb bone loading and body size in varanid lizards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3013","abstract":"Geometric scaling predicts that stresses on limb bones and muscles should increase with body size. Mammals counter this size-related increase in stress partially through changes in bone geometry, but largely through changes in posture, with larger species having a more erect stance. However, the ability to counter size-related stresses in this fashion may be limited to those taxa that have a parasagittal gait (such as mammals), where legs are swung underneath the body. We examined locomotor kinematics for 11 species of varanid lizards (from 0.04 to 8 kg body mass) that have a sprawling gait, to determine how they moderate size-related stresses. Posture, as indicated by femur adduction and hip heights, did not change significantly with body size, beyond that expected from geometrical scaling. Instead, lizards mitigated size-related increases in stress by increasing duty factor and possibly reducing femur rotation. Incorporating these factors in biomechanical models predicted that both bending (∝M0.016, where M is mass) and torsional (∝M–0.049) stresses should be nearly independent of body size over the size range examined. However, increasing duty factor and reducing femur rotation probably have deleterious effects on speed, and this difference in kinematics with size may explain why speed scales lower for sprawling lizards than for parasagittal mammals (∝M0.17 and ∝M0.24, respectively). Further, paralleling conclusions for the synapsid lineage, these findings suggest that evolution from sprawling to upright posture did not occur in archosaurs as a response to larger size; rather, these archosaurs likely became upright first and larger later."},{"title":"Cold-impaired cardiac performance in rats is only partially overcome by cold acclimation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3021","abstract":"The consequences of acute hypothermia include impaired cardiovascular performance, ultimately leading to circulatory collapse.

Wistar rats were held at a 12 h:12 h light:dark (L:D) photoperiod and room temperature (21°C; euthermic controls), or exposed to a simulated onset of winter in an environmental chamber by progressive acclimation to 1 h:23 h L:D and 4°C over 4 weeks. In vivo, acute cold exposure (core temperature, Tb=25°C) resulted in hypotension (approximately –20%) due to low cardiac output (approximately –30%) accompanying a bradycardia (approximately –50%). Cold acclimation (CA) induced only partial compensation for this challenge, including increased coronary flow at Tb=37°C (but not at Tb=25°C), maintenance of ventricular capillarity and altered sympathovagal balance (increased low:high frequency in power spectral analysis, PSA), suggesting physiological responses alone were insufficient to maintain cardiovascular performance. However, PSA showed maintenance of cardiorespiratory coupling on acute cold exposure in both groups. Ex vivo cardiac performance revealed no change in intrinsic heart rate, but a mechanical impairment of cardiac function at low temperatures following CA. While CA involved an increased capacity for β-oxidation, there was a paradoxical reduction in developed pressure as a result of adrenergic down-regulation. These data suggest that integrated plasticity is the key to cardiovascular accommodation of chronic exposure to a cold environment, but with the potential for improvement by intervention, for example with agents such as non-catecholamine inotropes."},{"title":"Learning the way to blood: first evidence of dual olfactory conditioning in a blood-sucking insect, Rhodnius prolixus. I. Appetitive learning","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3032","abstract":"It has been largely assumed that the individual experience of insects that are disease vectors might not only contribute to animal fitness, but also have an important influence on parasite transmission. Nevertheless, despite the invested efforts in testing the capacity to learn and remember information in blood-sucking insects, only little conclusive information has been obtained to date. Adapting a classical conditioning approach to our haematophagous model, we trained larvae of Rhodnius prolixus to associate l-lactic-acid, an odour perceived by these bugs but behaviourally neutral when presented alone, with food (i.e. positive reinforcement). Naive bugs – those exposed either to a conditioned stimulus (CS, l-lactic acid), unconditioned stimulus (US, heat) and reward (blood) alone or CS, US and reward in the absence of contingency – remained indifferent to the presence of an air stream loaded with l-lactic acid when tested in an olfactometer (random orientation), whereas the groups previously exposed to the contingency CS–US–reward (blood) were significantly attracted by l-lactic-acid. In a companion paper, the opposite, i.e. repellence, was induced in bugs exposed to the contingency of the same odour with a negative reinforcement. This constitutes the first evidence of olfactory conditioning in triatomine bugs, vectors of Chagas disease, and one of the few substantiations available to date of olfactory conditioning in haematophagous insects."},{"title":"Effects of molting on the visual acuity of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3055","abstract":"In crustaceans with compound eyes, the corneal lens of each facet is part of the exoskeleton and thus shed during molting. Here we used an optomotor assay to evaluate the impact of molting on visual acuity (as measured by the minimum resolvable angle, αmin) in the female blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. We found that visual acuity decreases substantially in the days prior to molting and is gradually recovered after molting. Four days prior to molting, αmin was 1.8 deg (N=5), a value approximating the best possible acuity in this species. In the 24 h before ecdysis occurred, αmin increased to 15.0 deg (N=12), corresponding to an eightfold drop in visual acuity. Within 6 days after molting, αmin returned to the pre-molting value. Micrographs of C. sapidus eyes showed that a gap between the corneal lens and the crystalline cone first appeared approximately 5 days prior to shedding and increased in width as the process progressed. This separation was likely responsible for the loss of visual acuity observed in behavioral tests. In blue crabs, mating is limited to the period of the female's pubertal molt, and a reduction in acuity during this time may have an effect on the sensory cues used in female mate choice. The results described here may be broadly applicable to all arthropods that molt and have particular importance for crustaceans that molt multiple times in their lifetime or have mating cycles that are paired with molting."},{"title":"Exceptional aerobic scope and cardiovascular performance of pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) may underlie resilience in a warming climate","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3074","abstract":"Little is known of the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of climate change on animals, yet it is clear that some species appear more resilient than others. As pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in British Columbia, Canada, have flourished in the current era of climate warming in contrast to other Pacific salmonids in the same watershed, this study investigated whether the continuing success of pink salmon may be linked with exceptional cardiorespiratory adaptations and thermal tolerance of adult fish during their spawning migration. Sex-specific differences existed in minimum and maximum oxygen consumption rates (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/214/18/3074/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/> and <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/214/18/3074/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/>, respectively) across the temperature range of 8 to 28°C, reflected in a higher aerobic scope (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/214/18/3074/embed/inline-graphic-3.gif\"/>) for males. Nevertheless, the aerobic scope of both sexes was optimal at 21°C (Topt) and was elevated across the entire temperature range in comparison with other Pacific salmonids. As Topt for aerobic scope of this pink salmon population is higher than in other Pacific salmonids, and historic river temperature data reveal that this population rarely encounters temperatures exceeding Topt, these findings offer a physiological explanation for the continuing success of this species throughout the current climate-warming period. Despite this, declining cardiac output was evident above 17°C, and maximum attainable swimming speed was impaired above ∼23°C, suggesting negative implications under prolonged thermal exposure. While forecasted summer river temperatures over the next century are likely to negatively impact all Pacific salmonids, we suggest that the cardiorespiratory capacity of pink salmon may confer a selective advantage over other species."},{"title":"Regulation of gas exchange and haemolymph pH in the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3062","abstract":"Ventilatory control of internal CO2 plays an important role in regulating extracellular acid–base balance in terrestrial animals. While this phenomenon is well understood among vertebrates, the role that respiration plays in the acid–base balance of insects is in need of much further study. To measure changes in insect haemolymph pH, we implanted micro pH optodes into the haemocoel of cockroaches (Nauphoeta cinerea). They were then exposed to normoxic, hypoxic, hyperoxic and hypercapnic atmospheres while their haemolymph pH, <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/214/18/3062/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/> and abdominal ventilation frequency were measured simultaneously. Intratracheal O2 levels were also measured in separate experiments. It was found that cockroaches breathing continuously control their ventilation to defend a haemolymph pH of 7.3, except under conditions where hypoxia (<10% O2) induces hyperventilation, or where ambient hypercapnia is in excess of haemolymph (>1% CO2). In contrast, intratracheal O2 levels fluctuated widely, but on average remained above 15% in normoxic (21% O2) atmospheres. Decapitation caused the cockroaches to display discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs). The alternating periods of ventilation and apnoea during DGCs caused haemolymph pH to fluctuate by 0.11 units. Exposure to hypoxia caused haemolymph pH to increase and initiated brief bouts of spiracular opening prior to the active ventilation phase. The spontaneous occurrence of DGCs in decapitated cockroaches indicates that central pattern generators in the thoracic and abdominal ganglia generate the periodic gas exchange pattern in the absence of control from the cephalic ganglion. This pattern continues to maintain gas exchange, but with less precision."},{"title":"Knowledgeable individuals lead collective decisions in ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3046","abstract":"Self-organisation underlies many collective processes in large animal groups, where coordinated patterns and activities emerge at the group level from local interactions among its members. Although the importance of key individuals acting as effective leaders has recently been recognised in certain collective processes, it is widely believed that self-organised decisions are evenly shared among all or a subset of individuals acting as decision-makers, unless there are significant conflicts of interests among group members. Here, we show that certain individuals are disproportionately influential in self-organised decisions in a system where all individuals share the same interests: nest site selection by the ant Temnothorax albipennis. Workers that visited a good available nest site prior to emigration (the familiar nest) memorised its location, and later used this memory to navigate efficiently and find that nest faster than through random exploration. Additionally, these workers relied on their private information to expedite individual decisions about the familiar nest. This conferred a bias in favour of familiar nests over novel nests during emigrations. Informed workers were shown to have a significantly greater share in both recruitment and transport to the familiar nest than naïve workers. This suggests that they were the main determinants of the collective preference for familiar nests, and thus contributed greatly to enhance collective performance. Overall, these results indicate that self-organised decisions are not always evenly shared among decision-makers, even in systems where there are no conflicts of interest. Animal groups may instead benefit from well-informed, knowledgeable individuals acting as leaders in decisions."},{"title":"Learning the way to blood: first evidence of dual olfactory conditioning in a blood-sucking insect, Rhodnius prolixus.

Learned aversion to host odours has been repeatedly suggested as a determinant for the distribution of disease vectors among host populations. Nevertheless, no experimental evidence has been obtained so far. Adapting a classical conditioning approach to our haematophagous model, we trained larvae of Rhodnius prolixus to associate l-lactic acid, an odour perceived by bugs but behaviourally neutral when presented alone, with a mechanical perturbation (i.e. negative reinforcement). Naive bugs and bugs exposed to CS, punishment, or CS and punishment without contingency remained indifferent to the presence of an air stream loaded with l-lactic acid (random orientation on a locomotion compensator), whereas the groups previously exposed to the contingency CS–punishment were significantly repelled by l-lactic acid. In a companion paper, the opposite, i.e. attraction, was induced in bugs exposed to the contingency of the same odour with a positive reinforcement. These constitute the first pieces of evidence of olfactory conditioning in triatomine bugs and the first demonstration that the same host odour can be used by insects that are disease vectors to learn to recognize either a host to feed on or a potentially defensive one. The orientation mechanism during repulsion is also discussed in light of our results."},{"title":"Subglottal pressure and fundamental frequency control in contact calls of juvenile Alligator mississippiensis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3082","abstract":"Vocalization is rare among non-avian reptiles, with the exception of the crocodilians, the sister taxon of birds. Crocodilians have a complex vocal repertoire. Their vocal and respiratory system is not well understood but appears to consist of a combination of features that are also found in the extremely vocal avian and mammalian taxa. Anatomical studies suggest that the alligator larynx is able to abduct and adduct the vocal folds, but not to elongate or shorten them, and is therefore lacking a key regulator of frequency, yet alligators can modulate fundamental frequency remarkably well. We investigated the morphological and physiological features of sound production in alligators. Vocal fold length scales isometrically across a wide range of alligator body sizes. The relationship between fundamental frequency and subglottal pressure is significant in some individuals at some isolated points, such as call onset and position of maximum fundamental frequency. The relationship is not consistent over large segments of the call. Fundamental frequency can change faster than expected by pressure changes alone, suggesting an active motor pattern controls frequency and is intrinsic to the larynx. We utilized a two-mass vocal fold model to test whether abduction and adduction could generate this motor pattern. The fine-tuned interplay between subglottal pressure and glottal adduction can achieve frequency modulations much larger than those resulting from subglottal pressure variations alone and of similar magnitude, as observed in alligator calls. We conclude that the alligator larynx represents a sound source with only two control parameters (subglottal pressure and vocal fold adduction) in contrast to the mammalian larynx in which three parameters can be altered to modulate frequency (subglottal pressure, vocal fold adduction and length/tension)."},{"title":"Visual control of steering in the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2809","abstract":"Box jellyfish carry an elaborate visual system consisting of 24 eyes, which they use for driving a number of behaviours. However, it is not known how visual input controls the swimming behaviour. In this study we exposed the Caribbean box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora to simple visual stimuli and recorded changes in their swimming behaviour. Animals were tethered in a small experimental chamber, where we could control lighting conditions. The behaviour of the animals was quantified by tracking the movements of the bell, using a high-speed camera. We found that the animals respond predictably to the darkening of one quadrant of the equatorial visual world by (1) increasing pulse frequency, (2) creating an asymmetry in the structure that constricts the outflow opening of the bell, the velarium, and (3) delaying contraction at one of the four sides of the bell. This causes the animals to orient their bell in such a way that, if not tethered, they would turn and swim away from the dark area. We conclude that the visual system of T. cystophora has a predictable effect on swimming behaviour."},{"title":"Pulmonary compliance and lung volume varies with ecomorphology in anuran amphibians: implications for ventilatory-assisted lymph flux","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/19/3279","abstract":"Vertical movement of lymph from ventral regions to the dorsally located lymph hearts in anurans is accomplished by specialized skeletal muscles working in concert with lung ventilation. We hypothesize that more terrestrial species with greater lymph mobilization capacities and higher lymph flux rates will have larger lung volumes and higher pulmonary compliance than more semi-aquatic or aquatic species. We measured in situ mean and maximal compliance (Δvolume/Δpressure), distensibility (%Δvolume/Δpressure) and lung volume over a range of physiological pressures (1.0 to 4.0 cmH2O) for nine species of anurans representing three families (Bufonide, Ranidae and Pipidae) that span a range of body masses and habitats from terrestrial to aquatic. We further examined the relationship between these pulmonary variables and lymph flux for a semi-terrestrial bufonid (Rhinella marina), a semi-aquatic ranid (Lithobates catesbeianus) and an aquatic pipid (Xenopus laevis). Allometric scaling of pulmonary compliance and lung volume with body mass showed significant differences at the family level, with scaling exponents ranging from ∼0.75 in Bufonidae to ∼1.3 in Pipidae. Consistent with our hypothesis, the terrestrial Bufonidae species had significantly greater pulmonary compliance and greater lung volumes compared with semi-aquatic Ranidae and aquatic Pipidae species. Pulmonary distensibility ranged from ∼20 to 35% cmH2O–1 for the three families but did not correlate with ecomorphology. For the three species for which lymph flux data are available, R. marina had a significantly higher (P<0.001) maximal compliance (84.9±2.7 ml cmH2O–1 kg–1) and lung volume (242.1±5.5 ml kg–1) compared with L. catesbeianus (54.5±0.12 ml cmH2O–1 kg–1 and 139.3±0.5 ml kg–1) and X. laevis (30.8±0.7 ml cmH2O–1 kg–1 and 61.3±2.5 ml kg–1). Lymph flux rates were also highest for R. marina, lowest for X. laevis and intermediate in L. catesbeianus. Thus, there is a strong correlation between pulmonary compliance, lung volume and lymph flux rates, which suggests that lymph mobilization capacity may explain some of the variation in pulmonary compliance and lung volume in anurans."},{"title":"Vector-based and landmark-guided navigation in desert ants inhabiting landmark-free and landmark-rich environments","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2845","abstract":"Two species of desert ants – the North African Cataglyphis fortis and the central Australian Melophorus bagoti – differ markedly in the visual complexity of their natural habitats: featureless salt pans and cluttered, steppe-like terrain, respectively. Here we ask whether the two species differ in their navigational repertoires, in particular, whether in homing they place different emphasis on their vector-based and landmark-based routines. In trying to answer this question, we applied the same experimental paradigms to individual foragers of either species on either continent: training and/or testing with and/or without artificial landmark arrays. We found that the open-terrain species C. fortis runs off its (path integration) home vector much more readily even in unfamiliar landmark settings than the cluttered-terrain species M. bagoti. These data support the hypothesis that C. fortis has a higher propensity to rely on vector-mediated navigation, whereas in the same experimental situations M. bagoti more easily switches to landmark-guided behaviour. In the actual navigational performances, such species-specific propensities are most likely shaped by environment-dependent individual experiences."},{"title":"Oxygen convective uptakes in gas exchange cycles in early diapause pupae of Pieris brassicae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2816","abstract":"Oxygen convective uptakes in gas exchange cycles were directly recorded in early diapause pupae of Pieris brassicae L.

During recording with both systems, measurements were also taken with infrared actography. The pupae displayed short discontinuous gas exchange cycles lasting 40–70 min. No true C phase was found by flow-through measurements; instead, flutter opening of the spiracles with discrete convective O2 uptakes began shortly after the O phase whereas CO2 release was suppressed by the inward directed passive suction ventilation. The F phase was characterized by a series of small CO2 bursts (flutter events). Between these bursts, novel sub-phase `miniflutter' was observed, which consisted of six to 10 miniature inspirations without any CO2 emission. During the flow-through measurements, oxygen convective uptakes were indirectly recorded by the infrared actograph as sudden extensions (lengthening) of the abdominal segments at each spiracular microopening."},{"title":"Migration- and exercise-induced changes to flight muscle size in migratory birds and association with IGF1 and myostatin mRNA expression","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2823","abstract":"Seasonal adjustments to muscle size in migratory birds may result from preparatory physiological changes or responses to changed workloads. The mechanisms controlling these changes in size are poorly understood. We investigated some potential mediators of flight muscle size (myostatin and insulin-like growth factor, IGF1) in pectoralis muscles of wild wintering or migrating white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis), captive white-throated sparrows that were photoperiod manipulated to be in a `wintering' or `migratory' (Zugunruhe) state, and captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) that were either exercised for 2 weeks in a wind tunnel or untrained. Flight muscle size increased in photo-stimulated `migrants' and in exercised starlings. Acute exercise but not long-term training caused increased expression of IGF1, but neither caused a change in expression of myostatin or its metalloprotease activator TLL1. Photo-stimulated `migrant' sparrows demonstrated increased expression of both myostatin and IGF1, but wild sparrows exhibited no significant seasonal changes in expression of either myostatin or IGF1. Additionally, in both study species we describe several splice variants of myostatin that are shared with distantly related bird species. We demonstrate that their expression patterns are not different from those of the typical myostatin, suggesting that they have no functional importance and may be mistakes of the splicing machinery. We conclude that IGF1 is likely to be an important mediator of muscle phenotypic flexibility during acute exercise and during endogenous, seasonal preparation for migration. The role of myostatin is less clear, but its paradoxical increase in photo-stimulated `migrants' may indicate a role in seasonal adjustments of protein turnover."},{"title":"Wing motion measurement and aerodynamics of hovering true hoverflies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2832","abstract":"Most hovering insects flap their wings in a horizontal plane (body having a large angle from the horizontal), called `normal hovering'. But some of the best hoverers, e.g. true hoverflies, hover with an inclined stroke plane (body being approximately horizontal). In the present paper, wing and body kinematics of four freely hovering true hoverflies were measured using three-dimensional high-speed video. The measured wing kinematics was used in a Navier–Stokes solver to compute the aerodynamic forces of the insects. The stroke amplitude of the hoverflies was relatively small, ranging from 65 to 85 deg, compared with that of normal hovering. The angle of attack in the downstroke (∼50 deg) was much larger that in the upstroke (∼20 deg), unlike normal-hovering insects, whose downstroke and upstroke angles of attack are not very different. The major part of the weight-supporting force (approximately 86%) was produced in the downstroke and it was contributed by both the lift and the drag of the wing, unlike the normal-hovering case in which the weight-supporting force is approximately equally contributed by the two half-strokes and the lift principle is mainly used to produce the force. The mass-specific power was 38.59–46.3 and 27.5–35.4 W kg–1 in the cases of 0 and 100% elastic energy storage, respectively. Comparisons with previously published results of a normal-hovering true hoverfly and with results obtained by artificially making the insects' stroke planes horizontal show that for the true hoverflies, the power requirement for inclined stroke-plane hover is only a little (<10%) larger than that of normal hovering."},{"title":"Stroke rates and diving air volumes of emperor penguins: implications for dive performance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2854","abstract":"Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), both at sea and at an experimental dive hole, often have minimal surface periods even after performance of dives far beyond their measured 5.6 min aerobic dive limit (ADL: dive duration associated with the onset of post-dive blood lactate accumulation). Accelerometer-based data loggers were attached to emperor penguins diving in these two different situations to further evaluate the capacity of these birds to perform such dives without any apparent prolonged recovery periods. Minimum surface intervals for dives as long as 10 min were less than 1 min at both sites. Stroke rates for dives at sea were significantly greater than those for dives at the isolated dive hole. Calculated diving air volumes at sea were variable, increased with maximum depth of dive to a depth of 250 m, and decreased for deeper dives. It is hypothesized that lower air volumes for the deepest dives are the result of exhalation of air underwater. Mean maximal air volumes for deep dives at sea were approximately 83% greater than those during shallow (<50 m) dives. We conclude that (a) dives beyond the 5.6 min ADL do not always require prolongation of surface intervals in emperor penguins, (b) stroke rate at sea is greater than at the isolated dive hole and, therefore, a reduction in muscle stroke rate does not extend the duration of aerobic metabolism during dives at sea, and (c) a larger diving air volume facilitates performance of deep dives by increasing the total body O2 store to 68 ml O2 kg–1. Although increased O2 storage and cardiovascular adjustments presumably optimize aerobic metabolism during dives, enhanced anaerobic capacity and hypoxemic tolerance are also essential for longer dives. This was exemplified by a 27.6 min dive, after which the bird required 6 min before it stood up from a prone position, another 20 min before it began to walk, and 8.4 h before it dived again."},{"title":"Sheep rumen and omasum primary cultures and source epithelia: barrier function aligns with expression of tight junction proteins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2871","abstract":"The forestomachs of cows and sheep have historically served as important models for the study of epithelial transport. Thus, the ruminal epithelium was among the first tissues in which absorption of chloride against an electrochemical gradient was observed, requiring a tight paracellular barrier to prevent back-leakage. However, little is known about ruminal barrier function, despite the considerable implications for ruminant health. The tight junction proteins of the omasum have never been investigated, and no cell culture model exists. We present a new method for the isolation of cells from forestomach epithelia. Protein expression of cells and source tissues of sheep were studied using western blot, PCR and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cultured cells were characterized by transepithelial resistance (TER) measurements and patch clamping. Cells developed TER values of 729±134 Ω cm2 (rumen) and 1522±126 Ω cm2 (omasum). Both primary cells and source epithelia of rumen and omasum expressed cytokeratin, occludin and claudins 1, 4 and 7 (but not claudins 2, 3, 5, 8 and 10), consistent with the observed paracellular sealing properties. Staining for claudin-1 reached the stratum basale. The full mRNA coding sequence of claudins 1, 4 and 7 (sheep) was obtained. Patch-clamp analyses of isolated cells proved expression of an anion conductance with a permeability sequence of gluconate<acetate<chloride. This is in accordance with a model that ruminal and omasal transport of anions such as chloride and acetate has to occur via a transcellular route and involves channel-mediated basolateral efflux, driven by Na+/K+-ATPase."},{"title":"Classical conditioning through auditory stimuli in Drosophila: methods and models","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2864","abstract":"The role of sound in Drosophila melanogaster courtship, along with its perception via the antennae, is well established, as is the ability of this fly to learn in classical conditioning protocols.

This appetitive conditioning produces results comparable to those obtained with chemical stimuli in aversive conditioning protocols. We applied a logistic model with general estimating equations to predict the dynamics of learning, which successfully predicts the outcome of training and provides a quantitative estimate of the rate of learning. Use of acoustic stimuli with appetitive conditioning provides both an alternative to models most commonly used in studies of learning and memory in Drosophila and a means of testing hearing in both sexes, independently of courtship responsiveness."},{"title":"Daily torpor reduces mass and changes stress and power output of soleus and EDL muscles in the Djungarian hamster, Phodopus sungorus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2896","abstract":"Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) undergo bouts of daily torpor in response to reduced photoperiod.

After 14 weeks, muscle mechanics were analyzed in each group, examining both extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle and soleus muscle from each individual. Control hamsters had significantly greater body mass (43%), EDL mass (24%), EDL length (9%) and soleus mass (48%) than the torpor hamsters. However, there were no significant differences between control and torpor groups in forearm length or soleus muscle length. There were no significant differences in either muscle between control and torpor hamsters in maximum twitch stress (force per unit area), tetanus force generation or relaxation times. Maximum soleus tetanic stress was 43% greater (P=0.039) and soleus work loop power output (P<0.001) was higher in torpor than in control hamsters. Maximum EDL tetanic stress was 26% greater in control than in torpor hamsters (P=0.046), but there was no significant effect on EDL power output (P=0.38). Rate of fatigue was not affected by torpor in either soleus or EDL muscles (P>0.43). Overall, extended use of daily torpor had no effect on the rate at which stress or work was produced in soleus and EDL muscles in Djungarian hamsters; however, torpor did increase the stress and power produced by the soleus."},{"title":"Antioxidant capacity develops with maturation in the deep-diving hooded seal","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2903","abstract":"Maturation in hooded seals is characterized by the rapid development of their physiological diving capacity and is accompanied by increases in oxidant production but not oxidative damage. To test the hypothesis that the antioxidant system of hooded seals develops as they transition from a terrestrial to an aquatic environment, we obtained the complete cDNA sequence that encodes the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a central regulator of the antioxidant response, and compared Nrf2 mRNA and protein expression levels in muscle samples from neonate, weaned pups and adult hooded seals, along with glutathione (GSH) levels and the activity/protein content of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), peroxyredoxin VI (PrxVI), thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), glutaredoxin 1 (Glrx1), glutathione disulphide reductase, glutathione S-transferase and glutamate-cysteine ligase. The Nrf2 of the hooded seal is 1822 bp long and encodes a protein of 606 amino acids with a leucine zipper domain and Keap1-mediated proteosomal degradation residues, which are key for Nrf2 function and regulation. Although neither Nrf2 mRNA nor Nrf2 nuclear protein content are higher in adults than in pups, GSH levels along with GPx, PrxVI, Trx1, TrxR and Glrx1 activity/protein content increase with maturation, suggesting that the potential for peroxide removal increases with development in hooded seals, and that these enzymes contribute to the regulation of the intracellular redox state and the prevention of oxidative damage in these deep-diving mammals."},{"title":"Branchial osmoregulation in the euryhaline bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas: a molecular analysis of ion transporters","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2883","abstract":"Bull sharks, Carcharhinus leucas, are one of only a few species of elasmobranchs that live in both marine and freshwater environments. Osmoregulation in euryhaline elasmobranchs is achieved through the control and integration of various organs (kidney, rectal gland and liver) in response to changes in environmental salinity. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms of ion transport in the gills of euryhaline elasmobranchs and how they are affected by osmoregulatory challenges. This study was conducted to gain insight into the branchial ion and acid-base regulatory mechanisms of C. leucas by identifying putative ion transporters and determining whether their expression is influenced by environmental salinity. We hypothesised that expression levels of the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) pump, Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3), vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (VHA) and anion exchanger pendrin (PDN) would be upregulated in freshwater (FW) C. leucas. Immunohistochemistry was used to localise all four ion transporters in gills of bull sharks captured in both FW and estuarine/seawater (EST/SW) environments. NHE3 immunoreactivity occurred in the apical region of cells with basolateral NKA expression whereas PDN was apically expressed in cells that also exhibited basolateral VHA immunoreactivity. In accordance with our hypotheses, quantitative real-time PCR showed that the mRNA expression of NHE3 and NKA was significantly upregulated in gills of FW-captured C. leucas relative to EST/SW-captured animals. These data suggest that NHE3 and NKA together may be important in mediating branchial Na+ uptake in freshwater environments, whereas PDN and VHA might contribute to Cl-/HCO3- transport in marine and freshwater bull shark gills."},{"title":"Auditory selectivity for acoustic features that confer species recognition in the túngara frog","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2911","abstract":"In anurans, recognition of species-specific acoustic signals is essential to finding a mate. In many species, behavioral tests have elucidated which acoustic features contribute to species recognition, but the mechanisms by which the brain encodes these species-specific signal components are less well understood. The túngara frog produces a `whine' mating call that is characterized by a descending frequency sweep. However, much of the signal is unnecessary for recognition, as recognition behavior can be triggered by a descending two-tone step that mimics the frequency change in a portion of the whine. To identify the brain regions that contribute to species recognition in the túngara frog, we exposed females to a full-spectrum whine, a descending two-tone step that elicits recognition, the reversed two-tone step that does not elicit recognition, or no sound, and we measured expression of the neural activity-dependent gene egr-1 in the auditory brainstem and thalamus. We found that the behavioral relevance of the stimuli was the best predictor of egr-1 expression in the laminar nucleus of the torus semicircularis but not elsewhere. That is, the laminar nucleus responded more to the whine and the two-tone step that elicits recognition than to the reversed two-tone step. In contrast, in other brainstem and thalamic nuclei, whines induced egr-1 expression but tones did not. These data demonstrate that neural responses in the laminar nucleus correspond to behavioral responses of females and they suggest that the laminar nucleus may act as a feature detector for the descending frequencies characteristic of conspecific calls."},{"title":"Milk energy output in Swiss mice throughout the first, second, third and fourth lactation events","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2919","abstract":"Most studies on the factors limiting sustained energy intake (SusEI) during peak lactation period have been performed in females at the 1st lactation event. However, an inconsistent change in SusEI is observed between the 1st and 2nd lactation event. Thus, the limits to SusEI may be associated with reproductive experiences, but the effects of reproductive experiences on SusEI or reproductive output remain unclear. Here, food intake, reproductive output, suckling behaviour and serum prolactin levels were measured in female Swiss mice throughout the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th lactation periods. Asymptotic food intake was significantly elevated during the 2nd lactation period relative to that observed during the 1st lactation period. Females in the 2nd lactation period exported significantly more energy in milk than those in the 1st lactation event and consequently raised larger litters with heavier litters at weaning. This was inconsistent with the prediction of the peripheral limitation hypothesis, but also did not provide support for the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis. Neither food intake nor reproductive output, indicative of litter size, litter mass and milk energy output (MEO), was different between the 1st, 3rd and 4th lactation event. Differences in suckling behaviour and serum prolactin levels were not significant between the four lactation events. Correlations of prolactin levels with asymptotic food intake, MEO and mammary gland mass were only observed in females during the 1st lactation period. This may suggest that prolactin is not a key factor in stimulating milk production when the mammary glands work at their maximum during the peak lactation period."},{"title":"Anaemia adjusts the aerobic physiology of snapper (Pagrus auratus) and modulates hypoxia avoidance behaviour during oxygen choice presentations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2927","abstract":"The effect of altered oxygen transport potential on behavioural responses to environmental hypoxia was tested experimentally in snapper, Pagrus auratus, treated with a haemolytic agent (phenylhydrazine) or a sham protocol. Standard metabolic rate was not different between anaemic and normocythaemic snapper (Hct=6.7 and 25.7 g dl-1, respectively), whereas maximum metabolic rate, and hence aerobic scope (AS), was consistently reduced in anaemic groups at all levels of water PO2 investigated (P<0.01). This reduction of AS conferred a higher critical oxygen limit (Pcrit) to anaemic fish (8.6±0.6 kPa) compared with normocythaemic fish (5.3±0.4 kPa), thus demonstrating reduced hypoxic tolerance in anaemic groups. In behavioural choice experiments, the critical avoidance PO2 in anaemic fish was 6.6±2.5 kPa compared with 2.9±0.5 kPa for controls (P<0.01). Behavioural avoidance was not associated with modulation of swimming speed. Despite differences in physiological and behavioural parameters, both groups avoided low PO2 just below their Pcrit, indicating that avoidance was triggered consistently when AS limits were reached and anaerobic metabolism was unavoidable. This was confirmed by high levels of plasma lactate in both treatments at the point of avoidance. This is the first experimental demonstration of avoidance behaviour being modulated by internal physiological state. From an ecological perspective, fish with disturbed oxygen delivery potential arising from anaemia, pollution or stress are likely to avoid environmental hypoxia at a higher PO2 than normal fish."},{"title":"Sink and swim: kinematic evidence for lifting-body mechanisms in negatively buoyant electric rays Narcine brasiliensis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2935","abstract":"Unlike most batoid fishes, electric rays neither oscillate nor undulate their body disc to generate thrust. Instead they use body–caudal–fin (BCF) locomotion. In addition, these negatively buoyant rays perform unpowered glides as they sink in the water column. In combination, BCF swimming and unpowered gliding are opposite ends on a spectrum of swimming, and electric rays provide an appropriate study system for understanding how the performance of each mode is controlled hydrodynamically. We predicted that the dorso-ventrally flattened body disc generates lift during both BCF swimming and gliding. To test this prediction, we examined 10 neonate lesser electric rays, Narcine brasiliensis, as they swam and glided. From video, we tracked the motion of the body, disc, pelvic fins and tail. By correlating changes in the motions of those structures with swimming performance, we have kinematic evidence that supports the hypothesis that the body disc is generating lift. Most importantly, both the pitch of the body disc and the tail, along with undulatory frequency, interact to control horizontal swimming speed and Strouhal number during BCF swimming. During gliding, the pitch of the body disc and the tail also interact to control the speed on the glide path and the glide angle."},{"title":"Northern elephant seals adjust gliding and stroking patterns with changes in buoyancy: validation of at-sea metrics of body density","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2973","abstract":"Many diving animals undergo substantial changes in their body density that are the result of changes in lipid content over their annual fasting cycle. Because the size of the lipid stores reflects an integration of foraging effort (energy expenditure) and foraging success (energy assimilation), measuring body density is a good way to track net resource acquisition of free-ranging animals while at sea. Here, we experimentally altered the body density and mass of three free-ranging elephant seals by remotely detaching weights and floats while monitoring their swimming speed, depth and three-axis acceleration with a high-resolution data logger. Cross-validation of three methods for estimating body density from hydrodynamic gliding performance of freely diving animals showed strong positive correlation with body density estimates obtained from isotope dilution body composition analysis over density ranges of 1015 to 1060 kg m–3. All three hydrodynamic models were within 1% of, but slightly greater than, body density measurements determined by isotope dilution, and therefore have the potential to track changes in body condition of a wide range of freely diving animals. Gliding during ascent and descent clearly increased and stroke rate decreased when buoyancy manipulations aided the direction of vertical transit, but ascent and descent speed were largely unchanged. The seals adjusted stroking intensity to maintain swim speed within a narrow range, despite changes in buoyancy. During active swimming, all three seals increased the amplitude of lateral body accelerations and two of the seals altered stroke frequency in response to the need to produce thrust required to overcome combined drag and buoyancy forces."},{"title":"Elastic deformation and energy loss of flapping fly wings","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2949","abstract":"During flight, the wings of many insects undergo considerable shape changes in spanwise and chordwise directions. We determined the origin of spanwise wing deformation by combining measurements on segmental wing stiffness of the blowfly Calliphora vicina in the ventral and dorsal directions with numerical modelling of instantaneous aerodynamic and inertial forces within the stroke cycle using a two-dimensional unsteady blade elementary approach. We completed this approach by an experimental study on the wing's rotational axis during stroke reversal. The wing's local flexural stiffness ranges from 30 to 40 nN m2 near the root, whereas the distal wing parts are highly compliant (0.6 to 2.2 nN m2). Local bending moments during wing flapping peak near the wing root at the beginning of each half stroke due to both aerodynamic and inertial forces, producing a maximum wing tip deflection of up to 46 deg. Blowfly wings store up to 2.30 μJ elastic potential energy that converts into a mean wing deformation power of 27.3 μW. This value equates to approximately 5.9 and 2.3% of the inertial and aerodynamic power requirements for flight in this animal, respectively. Wing elasticity measurements suggest that approximately 20% or 0.46 μJ of elastic potential energy cannot be recovered within each half stroke. Local strain energy increases from tip to root, matching the distribution of the wing's elastic protein resilin, whereas local strain energy density varies little in the spanwise direction. This study demonstrates a source of mechanical energy loss in fly flight owing to spanwise wing bending at the stroke reversals, even in cases in which aerodynamic power exceeds inertial power. Despite lower stiffness estimates, our findings are widely consistent with previous stiffness measurements on insect wings but highlight the relationship between local flexural stiffness, wing deformation power and energy expenditure in flapping insect wings."},{"title":"Humidity affects the extensibility of an orb-weaving spider's viscous thread droplets","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2988","abstract":"The prey-capture threads found in most spider orb webs rely on viscous droplets for their stickiness. Each droplet is formed of a central mass of viscoelastic glycoprotein glue surrounded by an aqueous covering, both of which incorporate hydrophilic components. We found that the extensibility of droplets on Larinioides cornutus threads increased as humidity increased. However, the deflection of the droplets' supporting axial lines did not change, indicating that atmospheric water uptake increases glycoprotein plasticity, but not glycoprotein adhesion. The extensibility of droplets, along with that of the thread's supporting axial fibers, is responsible for summing the adhesion of multiple thread droplets. Therefore, daily changes in humidity have the potential to significantly alter the performance of viscous threads and orb webs."},{"title":"Growing backwards: an inverted role for the shrimp ortholog of vertebrate myostatin and GDF11","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2671","abstract":"Myostatin (MSTN) and growth differentiation factor-11 (GDF11) are closely related proteins involved in muscle cell growth and differentiation as well as neurogenesis of vertebrates. Both MSTN and GDF11 negatively regulate their functions. Invertebrates possess a single ortholog of the MSTN/GDF11 family. In order to understand the role of MSTN/GDF11 in crustaceans, the gene ortholog was identified and characterized in the penaeid shrimp Penaeus monodon. The overall protein sequence and specific functional sites were highly conserved with other members of the MSTN/GDF11 family. Gene transcripts of pmMstn/Gdf11, assessed by real-time PCR, were detected in a variety of tissue types and were actively regulated in muscle across the moult cycle. To assess phenotypic function in shrimp, pmMstn/Gdf11 gene expression was downregulated by tail-muscle injection of sequence-specific double-stranded RNA. Shrimp with reduced levels of pmMstn/Gdf11 transcripts displayed a dramatic slowing in growth rate compared with control groups. Findings from this study place the MSTN/GDF11 gene at the centre of growth regulation in shrimp, but suggest that, compared with higher vertebrates, this gene has an opposite role in invertebrates such as shrimp, where levels of gene expression may positively regulate growth."},{"title":"Effects of altered ambient pressure on the volume and distribution of gas within the swimbladder of the adult zebrafish, Danio rerio","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/17/2962","abstract":"Many teleosts use gas-filled swimbladders to control buoyancy and influence three-dimensional orientation (pitch and roll). However, swimbladder volume, and its contributions to these functions, varies with depth-related pressure according to Boyle's law. Moreover, the swimbladder volume at a given depth also depends on the compliance of the swimbladder wall, but this latter factor has been investigated in only a limited number of species. In this study, changes in the volume of the zebrafish swimbladder were observed both in vitro and in situ in pressure chambers that allowed simulations of movements within the water column to and from depths of >300 cm. Results show the anterior chamber to be highly compliant, varying ±38% from its initial volume over the range of simulated depths. This large volume change was accomplished, at least in part, by a series of regular corrugations running along the ventral aspect of the chamber wall and another set of pleats radiating from around the communicating duct in the caudal aspect of the chamber wall. The posterior chamber, in contrast, was found to be minimally compliant, varying only a fraction of a percent from its initial volume over the same pressure range. The different volumetric responses of the chambers caused a significant shift in the distribution of gas within the swimbladder system, but only resulted in a change in the whole-body pitch angle of ±2 deg over the range of pressures tested. Together, our findings provide new insights into the control of buoyancy and trim within teleosts and suggest novel mechanisms that may contribute to swimbladder performance."},{"title":"Ammonia sensing by neuroepithelial cells and ventilatory responses to ammonia in rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2678","abstract":"Ammonia, the third respiratory gas in teleost fish, acts as an acute stimulant to ventilation in ammoniotelic rainbow trout. We investigated whether this sensitivity is maintained in trout chronically exposed (1+ months) to high environmental ammonia [HEA, 250 μmol l–1 (NH4)2SO4] in the water, and whether gill neuroepithelial cells (NECs) are involved in ammonia sensing. Hyperventilation was induced both by acute external (NH4)2SO4 exposure [250 or 500 μmol l–1 (NH4)2SO4] and by intra-arterial (NH4)2SO4 injection (580 μmol kg–1 of ammonia) in control trout, but these responses were abolished in chronic HEA animals. Hyperventilation in response to acute ammonia exposure persisted after bilateral removal of each of the four gill arch pairs separately or after combined removal of arches III and IV, but was delayed by removal of gill arch I, and eliminated by combined removal of arches I and II. NECs, identified by immunolabeling against 5-HT, were mainly organized in two lines along the filament epithelium in all four gill arches. In control trout, NECs were slightly smaller but more abundant on arches I and II than on arches III and IV. Chronic HEA exposure reduced the density of the NECs on all four arches, and their size on arches I and II only. Fura-2 fluorescence imaging was used to measure intracellular free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) responses in single NECs in short-term (24–48 h) culture in vitro. [Ca2+]i was elevated to a comparable extent by perfusion of 30 mmol l–1 KCl and 1 mmol l–1 NH4Cl, and these [Ca2+]i responses presented in two different forms, suggesting that ammonia may be sensed by multiple mechanisms. The [Ca2+]i responses to high ammonia were attenuated in NECs isolated from trout chronically exposed to HEA, especially in ones from gill arch I, but responses to high K+ were unchanged. We conclude that the hyperventilatory response to ammonia is lost after chronic waterborne HEA exposure, and that NECs, especially the ones located in gill arches I and II, are probably ammonia chemoreceptors that participate in ventilatory modulation in trout."},{"title":"Gliding saves time but not energy in Malayan colugos","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2690","abstract":"Gliding is thought to be an economical form of locomotion. However, few data on the climbing and gliding of free-ranging gliding mammals are available. This study employed an animal-borne three-dimensional acceleration data-logging system to collect continuous data on the climbing and gliding of free-ranging Malayan colugos, Galeopterus variegatus. We combined these movement data with empirical estimates of the metabolic costs to move horizontally or vertically to test this long-standing hypothesis by determining whether the metabolic cost to climb to sufficient height to glide a given distance was less than the cost to move an equivalent distance horizontally through the canopy. On average, colugos climb a short distance to initiate glides. However, due to the high energetic cost of climbing, gliding is more energetically costly to move a given horizontal distance than would be predicted for an animal travelling the same distance through the canopy. Furthermore, because colugos spend a small fraction of their time engaged in locomotor activity, the high costs have little effect on their overall energy budget. As a result, the energetic economy hypothesis for the origins of gliding is not supported. It is likely that other ecologically relevant factors have played a greater role in the origins of gliding in colugos and other mammals."},{"title":"Hearing and morphological specializations of the mojarra (Eucinostomus argenteus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2697","abstract":"The air-filled swimbladder acts as an acoustic amplifier for some fish by converting sound pressure into particle motion, which is transmitted to the inner ear.

Hearing tests show the mojarra has better hearing sensitivity than other species of fish without a connection. However, mojarras do not seem to use this adaptation for communication. Furthermore, the inclined position of the swimbladder may help the fish to catch their prey more easily, as the swimbladder will be horizontal when they are picking up benthic prey."},{"title":"Do wood ants learn sequences of visual stimuli?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2739","abstract":"The visually guided foraging routes of some formicine ants are individually stereotyped, suggesting the importance of visual learning in maintaining these routes. We ask here whether the wood ant Formica rufa learns a sequence of visual features encountered at different stages along a route, as reported for honeybees. We trained ants in several simple mazes to follow two alternative routes. Along each two-stage route, the ants first encountered one of two priming stimuli. The identity of the priming stimulus determined which of two choice stimuli was rewarded in the second stage of the route. As stimuli we used ultraviolet and yellow/green light panels, and two black-and-white patterns. Did ants learn to pair each colour with the appropriate black-and-white pattern? Ants learnt readily to discriminate between the two coloured stimuli or between the two black-and-white patterns. They could also pair coloured and black-and-white patterns, provided that the two were presented simultaneously. The ants' behaviour with sequential stimuli varied according to whether the priming stimulus was a coloured stimulus or a black-and-white pattern. When the priming stimulus was coloured, ants seemed to learn the two sequences, but tests showed that their success was probably caused by the after-effects of colour adaptation. With a black-and-white priming stimulus and a coloured second stage stimulus, robust sequential learning could not be demonstrated, although under certain experimental conditions a tiny proportion of ants did acquire the sequence. Thus, ants perform conditional discriminations reliably when priming and choice stimuli are simultaneous, but they usually fail when the stimuli are sequential."},{"title":"Sound production and mechanism in Heniochus chrysostomus (Chaetodontidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2702","abstract":"The diversity in calls and sonic mechanisms appears to be important in Chaetodontidae. Calls in Chaetodon multicinctus seem to include tail slap, jump, pelvic fin flick and dorsal–anal fin erection behaviors. Pulsatile sounds are associated with dorsal elevation of the head, anterior extension of the ventral pectoral girdle and dorsal elevation of the caudal skeleton in Forcipiger flavissiumus. In Hemitaurichthys polylepis, extrinsic swimbladder muscles could be involved in sounds originating from the swimbladder and correspond to the inward buckling of tissues situated dorsally in front of the swimbladder. These examples suggest that this mode of communication could be present in other members of the family. Sounds made by the pennant bannerfish (Heniochus chrysostomus) were recorded for the first time on coral reefs and when fish were hand held. In hand-held fishes, three types of calls were recorded: isolated pulses (51%), trains of four to 11 pulses (19%) and trains preceded by an isolated pulse (29%). Call frequencies were harmonic and had a fundamental frequency between 130 and 180 Hz. The fundamental frequency, sound amplitude and sound duration were not related to fish size. Data from morphology, sound analysis and electromyography recordings highlight that the calls are made by extrinsic sonic drumming muscles in association with the articulated bones of the ribcage. The pennant bannerfish system differs from other Chaetodontidae in terms of sound characteristics, associated body movements and, consequently, mechanism."},{"title":"Endogenous vascular synthesis of B-type and C-type natriuretic peptides in the rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2709","abstract":"In mammals, natriuretic peptides (NPs) lower blood pressure, reduce blood volume and broadly inhibit cardiovascular remodeling. NPs are often referred to as cardiac hormones, though they also have integral roles in regulating vascular tone, endothelial remodeling and inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy. Two NPs [atrial (ANP) and C-type (CNP)] have been identified as endogenous constituents in the vasculature of mammals, though such a phenomenon has not previously been described in fishes. Here we describe the endogenous production of B-type NP (BNP) and CNP in multiple blood vessels of the rainbow trout. Western blot analysis showed pro-BNP and pro-CNP production in the efferent branchial artery, celiacomesenteric artery, ventral aorta and anterior cardinal vein. The detection of pro-BNP and pro-CNP was also supported by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of NP-enriched tissue extracts. Although vascular pro-peptide levels of BNP and CNP were quantitatively quite comparable to those found in reference tissues (the atrium for BNP and brain for CNP), mRNA levels of these NPs in the vasculature were greatly reduced as determined by quantitative PCR. When the evolutionarily conserved vascular NP (CNP) was infused into un-anesthetized trout, it reduced central venous pressure and mean circulatory filling pressure. CNP also decreased cardiac output via a reduction in preload. The presence of endogenous NP production in the trout vasculature and potent in vivo hypotensive effects further support the numerous functional similarities between teleost and mammalian NP systems."},{"title":"Adaptation in the optical properties of the crystalline lens in the eyes of the Lessepsian migrant Siganus rivulatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2724","abstract":"Vision is an important source of information for many animals. The crystalline lens plays a central role in the visual pathway and hence the ecology of fishes. In this study, we tested whether the different light regimes in the Mediterranean and Red Seas have an effect on the optical properties of the lenses in the rivulated rabbitfish, Siganus rivulatus. This species has migrated through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea and established a vital population in the Mediterranean Sea. Longitudinal spherical aberration curves and focal lengths of the fish lenses were measured by laser scans and compared between the two populations. In addition, rivulated rabbitfish from the Mediterranean Sea were exposed to colored light (yellow, green and blue) and unfiltered light for periods of 1 or 13 days to test for short-term adjustments. Lens focal length was significantly longer (3%) in the Rea Sea population. The shorter focal length of the Mediterranean population can be explained as an adaptation to the dimmer light environment, as this difference makes the Mediterranean eyes 5% more sensitive than the eyes of the Red Sea population. The difference may be due to genetic differences or, more likely, adaptive developmental plasticity. Short-term regulatory mechanisms do not seem to be involved."},{"title":"Streamlining behaviour of the red urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus in response to flow","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2655","abstract":"This work was motivated by subtidal observations of red urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) moving their spines into streamlined positions as water current increased in the field. Trials in a flume across flow speeds from 0 to 65 cm s–1 enabled us to observe the change in overall shape of the urchins and quantify the decrease in spine angle that occurred as flow speeds increased. The effect of this behaviour on drag and lift was measured with physical models made from urchin tests with spines in the `up' position (typical in stagnant and slow velocities) and in the `down' position (typical of posture in high velocities). Streamlining spines decreased the drag, but increased the lift experienced by urchin models at flow speeds between 10 and 40 cm s–1, current velocities that are commonly encountered by these animals in the field in Washington, USA. Total force (combination of drag and lift) was similar for `up' and `down' models at all flow speeds, lift comprising the majority of the force for `down' models, and drag slightly higher for `up' models. Live urchins in the field routinely adopt a streamlined `down' posture in flow, suggesting that they may be better able to cope with lift than drag. This behaviour, although affecting hydrodynamic forces and enabling S. franciscanus to remain attached to the substratum in high currents, may lead to reduced capture of drift kelp, which is entrapped on upright spines and then eaten, delivery of which is positively related to flow speed. Urchins living in deep subtidal habitats rely on drift kelp capture but must stay attached to the substratum to be successful in a habitat. Therefore, this streamlining behaviour may be an important factor enabling S. franciscanus to persist in deep, high-current areas."},{"title":"Dominance hierarchy-dependent behavioural plasticity of crayfish avoidance reactions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2718","abstract":"Crayfish showed avoidance reactions when mechanical stimulation was applied to their tailfan.

We show that the response pattern to the same sensory stimulus changed with social status in the small crayfish. Crayfish are territorial animals and a dominant–subordinate relationship was determined when two previously unacquainted animals were paired. This winner–loser hierarchy was observed in pairs of small crayfish. Before fighting, all crayfish showed a dart response following mechanical stimulation of the tailfan. However, the probability of occurrence of a turn response increased significantly in the crayfish that won a fight. This behavioural transition from dart to turn response occurred immediately and was maintained for at least 3 days even if a dominant crayfish was isolated again with no opponent."},{"title":"Different effects of temperature on foraging activity schedules in sympatric Myrmecia ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2730","abstract":"Animals avoid temperatures that constrain foraging by restricting activity to specific times of the day or year. However, because temperature alters the availability of food resources, it is difficult to separate temperature-dependent effects on foraging and the occupation of temporal niches. By studying two congeneric, sympatric Myrmecia ants we isolated the effect of temperature and investigated whether temperature affects foraging schedules and causes the two ants to be active at distinct times of the day or year. We monitored foraging activity and identified the ants' temperature tolerance in the laboratory by determining (1) critical thermal minima and maxima (CTmin and CTmax) and (2) the relationship between walking speed and temperature. Ants of Myrmecia croslandi were diurnal throughout the year, but ceased above-ground activity during winter. Surface temperature at the onset of foraging was 9.8–30.1°C, while their laboratory CTmin and CTmax were 10.4 and 48.5°C, respectively. Time of foraging onset was significantly influenced by surface temperature at time of sunrise and of onset. Ants of Myrmecia pyriformis were nocturnal throughout the year. Surface temperature at the onset of foraging was 5.4–26.2°C, while their laboratory CTmin and CTmax were 8.2 and 41.6°C, respectively. Time of foraging onset was not influenced by surface temperature, but solely by sunset time. We conclude that temperature determines the timing of foraging as well as the daily and seasonal foraging activity in M. croslandi, but has less obvious effects on M. pyriformis. In both species, CTmax was greater than temperatures at the natural foraging times."},{"title":"High phosphate uptake requirements of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2749","abstract":"Several untested aspects of the regulation of inorganic nutrient uptake were examined using nutrient depletion experiments with the symbiotic coral Stylophora pistillata. The total inhibition of phosphate uptake in artificial seawater lacking sodium indicates the involvement of a sodium/phosphate symporter for the uptake of phosphate across host membranes. Addition of ammonium or nitrate (up to 6.0 μmol l–1) did not enhance saturated phosphate uptake rates, thus indicating that corals, or their symbiotic algae, were not, or not sufficiently, nitrogen limited to modify their phosphate needs. Conversely, the saturated uptake rate of ammonium increased by 2.5-fold in the presence of 3.0 μmol l–1 of phosphate, thus indicating that the corals or their symbionts were lacking intracellular phosphate to take advantage of the inorganic nitrogen compounds dissolved in their surrounding medium. Overall, these results highlight some greater limitation in phosphate rather than in nitrogen. Finally, the rate of phosphate uptake decreased with particulate feeding of the host (organic phosphate source). Indeed, corals that were fed 1 and 3 days before the uptake experiment took up phosphate 42 and 19% slower, respectively, than corals that were fed 21 days before. This result provides additional evidence of phosphate limitation in S. pistillata. This study therefore brings new insights into the relationships between nutrients and symbiotic corals, and may provide a rapid and effective tool to investigate which nutrient is the most limiting for coral metabolism."},{"title":"Identification and evolutionary implications of neurotransmitter–ciliary interactions underlying the behavioral response to hypoxia in Lymnaea stagnalis embryos","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2660","abstract":"Acceleration of embryonic rotation is a common response to hypoxia among pond snails. It was first characterized in Helisoma trivolvis embryos, which have a pair of sensorimotor neurons that detect hypoxia and release serotonin onto postsynaptic ciliary cells. The objective of the present study was to determine how the hypoxia response is mediated in Lymnaea stagnalis, which differ from H. trivolvis by having both serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons, and morphologically distinct ciliated structures at comparative stages of embryonic development. Time-lapse video recordings of the rotational behavior in L. stagnalis revealed similar rotational features to those previously observed in H. trivolvis, including rotational surges and rotational responses to hypoxia. Serotonin and dopamine increased the rate of rotation with similar potency. In contrast, serotonin was more potent than dopamine in stimulating the ciliary beat frequency of isolated pedal cilia. Isolated apical plate cilia displayed an irregular pattern of ciliary beating that precluded the measurement of ciliary beat frequency. A qualitative assessment of ciliary beating revealed that both serotonin and dopamine were able to stimulate apical plate cilia. The ciliary responses to dopamine were reversible in both pedal and apical plate cilia, whereas the responses to serotonin were only reversible at concentrations below 100 μmol l–1. Mianserin, a serotonin receptor antagonist, and SKF83566, a dopamine receptor antagonist, effectively blocked the rotational responses to serotonin and dopamine, respectively. The rotational response to hypoxia was only partially blocked by mianserin, but was fully blocked by SKF83566. These data suggest that, despite the ability of serotonin to stimulate ciliary beating in L. stagnalis embryos, the rotational response to hypoxia is primarily mediated by the transient apical catecholaminergic neurons that innervate the ciliated apical plate."},{"title":"Fully reversible phenotypic plasticity of digestive physiology in young house sparrows: lack of long-term effect of early diet composition","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2755","abstract":"Feeding conditions during the nestling period may significantly affect whole-life fitness in altricial birds but little is known about the physiological mechanisms responsible for these effects. Permanent changes (irreversible developmental plasticity) in digestive physiology caused by the neonatal diet may form such a mechanism. We previously showed that the lack of starch in the diet of house sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings between 3 and 12 days post-hatching significantly decreased the activity of intestinal maltase, an enzyme essential for starch digestion. To check whether diet-induced variation in maltase activity in young house sparrows is reversible, we raised them under laboratory conditions from 3 until 30 days of age on diets with either 0% starch or 25% starch, with some individuals experiencing a switch in their assigned diet at 12 days of age. We found evidence for the presence of an internal, presumably genetic, program for changes in the activity of maltase and sucrase, which was, however, significantly affected by diet composition (i.e. environmental factor). Digestive enzyme activity in 30 day old birds was not influenced by diet composition prior to day 12 but instead depended only on diet that was fed between days 12 and 30. We conclude that plasticity in the activity of intestinal disaccharidases in house sparrow nestlings represents completely reversible phenotypic flexibility that can help young sparrows to cope with unpredictable variation in food composition during ontogeny without long-term effects on their digestive system. However, comparison with other species suggests that the magnitude of digestive flexibility in young passerines may be evolutionarily matched to species-specific variation in feeding conditions."},{"title":"Early elevation of testosterone advances migratory preparation in a songbird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2761","abstract":"The timing of events associated with spring migration can be an important determinant of fitness for migratory birds. The need to prepare and maintain physical condition for migration is one demand that must be met for early arrival on breeding areas, and this demand is compounded by the energetic demands of the physiological transition to breeding. Here, we examined whether migratory birds, specifically males, can adequately meet both of these demands by elevating the sex steroid testosterone early during migratory preparation. To test this, we used a captive experiment in which we photostimulated male dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) and manipulated circulating testosterone. We predicted males with elevated testosterone would prepare to migrate and breed faster than control males or males where the ability of testosterone to bind with receptors, or be converted to estradiol, was inhibited (testosterone inhibited). We measured migratory preparation using mass, food intake, fat deposits and nocturnal activity (Zugunruhe). To estimate breeding preparation, we measured the diameter of the cloacal protuberance (CP). We found that males in the testosterone treatment group began migratory preparation approximately 10 days before controls. There was no difference in the magnitude of peak migratory condition between testosterone-implanted birds and controls. Males implanted with testosterone also reached the onset of breeding preparation faster and had larger peak CP diameter compared with controls. Testosterone-inhibited birds showed no signs of migratory preparation and only a weak increase in CP diameter. These results demonstrate that early elevation of testosterone during migratory preparation could incur benefits for males in terms of the ability to depart earlier from non-breeding areas and arrive in a more advanced breeding condition. This experiment demonstrates that there may be important physiological underpinnings to known winter to breeding season carry-over effects in migratory birds."},{"title":"Physiological trade-offs in self-maintenance: plumage molt and stress physiology in birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2768","abstract":"Trade-offs between self-maintenance processes can affect life-history evolution. Integument replacement and the stress response both promote self-maintenance and affect survival in vertebrates. Relationships between the two processes have been studied most extensively in birds, where hormonal stress suppression is down regulated during molt in seasonal species, suggesting a resource-based trade-off between the two processes. The only species found to differ are the rock dove and Eurasian tree sparrow, at least one of which performs a very slow molt that may reduce resource demands during feather growth, permitting investment in the stress response. To test for the presence of a molt–stress response trade-off, we measured hormonal stress responsiveness during and outside molt in two additional species with extended molts, red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) and zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We found that both species maintain hormonal stress responsiveness during molt. Further, a comparative analysis of all available species revealed a strong relationship between molt duration and degree of hormonal suppression. Though our results support trade-off hypotheses, these data can also be explained by alternative hypotheses that have not been formally addressed in the literature. We found a strong relationship between stress suppression and seasonality of breeding and evidence suggesting that the degree of suppression may be either locally adaptable or plastic and responsive to local environmental conditions. We hypothesize that environmental unpredictability favors extended molt duration, which in turn allows for maintenance of the hormonal stress response, and discuss implications of a possible trade-off for the evolution of molt schedules."},{"title":"Experimentally increased in ovo testosterone leads to increased plasma bactericidal activity and decreased cutaneous immune response in nestling house wrens","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2778","abstract":"Maternally derived testosterone in the eggs of birds may benefit nestlings by increasing various aspects of their growth, condition and behavioral development, but these benefits may come at a cost, including suppression of immune responsiveness. Experiments on a variety of species in which in ovo levels of testosterone have been experimentally increased have produced mixed results; some have found increased growth and suppressed immune function of nestlings whereas others have found the opposite. In an attempt to clarify the relationship between in ovo testosterone and nestling size, mass, health state and immune responsiveness, we experimentally increased levels of testosterone in the eggs of house wrens (Troglodytes aedon). We simultaneously determined the size, mass, hematocrit (a measure of health state), cutaneous immune response to phytohaemagglutinin and plasma bactericidal activity of nestlings near the time of fledging. We predicted that nestlings hatching from testosterone-injected eggs would exhibit lower immune responsiveness, but achieve greater mass, size and condition, than nestlings hatching from vehicle-injected control eggs. Instead, we found that nestlings hatching from testosterone-injected eggs had a weaker cutaneous immune response but greater bactericidal activity than those hatching from control eggs. They did not, however, differ significantly in mass, size or hematocrit from controls. These results suggest that experimentally increased in ovo testosterone induced a trade-off between bactericidal activity and the cutaneous immune response. The opposite responses by two different measures of immune function to experimentally increased in ovo testosterone underscore the importance of including multiple immune assays when investigating the potential for trade-offs with the immune system and other physiological functions."},{"title":"Effects of temperature on the respiration of brooded larvae from tropical reef corals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2783","abstract":"This study describes the effects of temperature on the respiration of brooded larvae of scleractinian corals, and evaluates the implications of these effects relative to seawater temperature when peak larval release occurs. Respiration rates of larvae from Pocillopora damicornis, Seriatopora hystrix and Stylophora pistillata were quantified in darkness as oxygen uptake during 1–3 h exposures to five temperatures between 26.4 and 29.6°C. To assess the biological significance of these experiments, the temperature of the seawater into which larvae of P. damicornis and S. hystrix were released was measured for 32–34 months over 5 years between 2003 and 2008. Mean respiration varied from 0.029 to 0.116 nmol O2 larva–1 min–1, and was related parabolically to temperature with a positive threshold at 28.0°C. The temperature coefficients (Q10) for the ascending portion of these relationships (Q10=15–76) indicate that the temperature dependency is stronger than can be explained by kinetics alone, and probably reflects behavioral and developmental effects. Larval release occurred year-round in synchrony with the lunar periodicity when seawater temperature ranged from 21.8 to 30.7°C, and more than half of the sampled larvae were released at 27.5–28.9°C. The coincidence on the temperature scale of peak larval release with the thermal threshold for respiration suggests that high metabolic rates have selective value for pelagic coral larvae. The large and rapid effects of temperature on larval respiration have implications for studies of the effects of climate change on coral reproduction, particularly when seawater temperature exceeds ∼28°C, when our results predict that larval respiration will be greatly reduced."},{"title":"A multilevel approach to examining cephalopod growth using Octopus pallidus as a model","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2799","abstract":"Many aspects of octopus growth dynamics are poorly understood, particularly in relation to sub-adult or adult growth, muscle fibre dynamics and repro-somatic investment. The growth of 5 month old Octopus pallidus cultured in the laboratory was investigated under three temperature regimes over a 12 week period: seasonally increasing temperatures (14–18°C); seasonally decreasing temperatures (18–14°C); and a constant temperature mid-way between seasonal peaks (16°C). Differences in somatic growth at the whole-animal level, muscle tissue structure and rate of gonad development were investigated. Continuous exponential growth was observed, both at a group and at an individual level, and there was no detectable effect of temperature on whole-animal growth rate. Juvenile growth rate (from 1 to 156 days) was also monitored prior to the controlled experiment; exponential growth was observed, but at a significantly faster rate than in the older experimental animals, suggesting that O. pallidus exhibit a double-exponential two-phase growth pattern. There was considerable variability in size-at-age even between individuals growing under identical thermal regimes. Animals exposed to seasonally decreasing temperatures exhibited a higher rate of gonad development compared with animals exposed to increasing temperatures; however, this did not coincide with a detectable decline in somatic growth rate or mantle condition. The ongoing production of new mitochondria-poor and mitochondria-rich muscle fibres (hyperplasia) was observed, indicated by a decreased or stable mean muscle fibre diameter concurrent with an increase in whole-body size. Animals from both seasonal temperature regimes demonstrated higher rates of new mitochondria-rich fibre generation relative to those from the constant temperature regime, but this difference was not reflected in a difference in growth rate at the whole-body level. This is the first study to record ongoing hyperplasia in the muscle tissue of an octopus species, and provides further insight into the complex growth dynamics of octopus."},{"title":"Associative olfactory learning in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2495","abstract":"Locusts can learn associations between olfactory stimuli and food rewards, and use the acquired memories to choose between foods according to their nutrient requirements. They are a model system for both the study of olfactory coding and insect nutritional regulation. Previous studies have used operant paradigms for conditioning freely moving locusts, restricting the study of the neural mechanisms underlying the acquisition of olfactory memories, which requires restrained preparations for electrophysiological recordings. Here we present two complementary paradigms for the classical conditioning of olfactory memories in restrained desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria). These paradigms allow precise experimental control over the parameters influencing learning. The first paradigm is based on classical (Pavlovian) appetitive conditioning. We show that opening of the maxillary palps can be used as a measure of memory acquisition. Maxillary palp opening in response to odour presentation is significantly higher in locusts trained with paired presentation of an odour and a food reward than in locusts trained either with unpaired presentation of food and odour or the odour alone. The memory formed by this conditioning paradigm lasts for at least 24 h. In the second paradigm, we show that classical conditioning of an odour memory in restrained locusts influences their decisions in a subsequent operant task. When locusts that have been trained to associate an odour with a food reward are placed in a Y-maze, they choose the arm containing that odour significantly more often than naïve locusts. A single conditioning trial is sufficient to induce a significant bias for that odour for up to 4 h. Multiple- and block-trial training induce a significant bias that lasts at least 24 h. Thus, locusts are capable of forming appetitive olfactory memories in classical conditioning paradigms and can use these memories to modify their decisions."},{"title":"The influence of 17β-estradiol on intestinal calcium carbonate precipitation and osmoregulation in seawater-acclimated rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/16/2791","abstract":"The intestine of marine teleosts produces carbonate precipitates from ingested calcium as part of their osmoregulatory strategy in seawater. The potential for estrogens to control the production of intestinal calcium carbonate and so influence osmoregulation was investigated in seawater-acclimated rainbow trout following intraperitoneal implantation of 17β-estradiol (E2) at two doses (0.1 and 10 μg E2 g–1). Levels of plasma vitellogenin provided an indicator of estrogenic effect, increasing significantly by three and four orders of magnitude at the low and high doses, respectively. Plasma osmolality and muscle water content were unaffected, whereas E2-treated fish maintained lower plasma [Na+] and [Cl–]. Plasma [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] and muscle [Ca2+] increased with vitellogenin induction, whereas the intestinal excretion of calcium carbonate was reduced. This suggests that elevated levels of circulating E2 may enhance Ca2+ uptake via the gut and simultaneously reduce CaCO3 formation, which normally limits intestinal availability of Ca2+. Increasing E2 caused an elevation of [Na+] and [Cl–] and a reduction of [HCO3–] in intestinal fluid. We speculate that E2 may influence a number of intestinal ion transport processes that ultimately may influence water absorption: (1) reduced NaCl cotransport, (2) reduced Cl– uptake via Cl–/HCO3– exchange and (3) reduced precipitation of Ca2+ and Mg2+ carbonates. Despite these effects on intestinal ion and water transport, overall osmoregulatory status was not compromised in E2-treated fish, suggesting the possibility of compensation by other organs."},{"title":"Orientation of hatchling loggerhead sea turtles to regional magnetic fields along a transoceanic migratory pathway","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2504","abstract":"Young loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from the east coast of Florida, USA, undertake a transoceanic migration around the North Atlantic Gyre, the circular current system that flows around the Sargasso Sea. Previous experiments indicated that loggerhead hatchlings, when exposed to magnetic fields replicating those that exist at five widely separated locations along the migratory pathway, responded by swimming in directions that would, in each case, help turtles remain in the gyre and advance along the migratory route. In this study, hatchlings were exposed to several additional magnetic fields that exist along or outside of the gyre's northern boundary. Hatchlings responded to fields that exist within the gyre currents by swimming in directions consistent with their migratory route at each location, whereas turtles exposed to a field that exists north of the gyre had an orientation that was statistically indistinguishable from random. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that loggerhead turtles entering the sea for the first time possess a navigational system in which a series of regional magnetic fields sequentially trigger orientation responses that help steer turtles along the migratory route. By contrast, hatchlings may fail to respond to fields that exist in locations beyond the turtles' normal geographic range."},{"title":"Penguins are attracted to dimethyl sulphide at sea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2509","abstract":"Breeding Spheniscus penguins are central place foragers that feed primarily on schooling pelagic fish. They are visual hunters, but it is unclear how they locate prey patches on a coarse scale. Many petrels and storm petrels (Procellariiformes), the penguins' closest relatives, use olfactory cues to locate prey concentrations at sea, but this has not been demonstrated for penguins. Procellariiforms are attracted to a variety of olfactory cues, including dimethyl sulphide (DMS), an organosulphur compound released when phytoplankton is grazed, as well as fish odorants such as cod liver oil. A recent study found that African penguins Spheniscus demersus react to DMS on land. We confirm this result and show that African penguins are also attracted by DMS at sea. DMS-scented oil slicks attracted 2–3 times more penguins than control slicks, whereas penguins showed no response to slicks containing cod liver oil. The number of penguins attracted to DMS increased for at least 30 min, suggesting penguins could travel up to 2 km to reach scent cues. Repeats of land-based trials confirmed previous results showing DMS sensitivity of penguins on land. Our results also support the hypothesis that African penguins use DMS as an olfactory cue to locate prey patches at sea from a distance, which is particularly important given their slow commuting speed relative to that of flying seabirds."},{"title":"The kinematic consequences of locomotion on sloped arboreal substrates in a generalized (Rattus norvegicus) and a specialized (Sciurus vulgaris) rodent","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2544","abstract":"Small mammals must negotiate terrains that consist of numerous substrates that vary in diameter, surface structure, rigidity and orientation. Most studies on mammals have focused on the effects of substrate diameter during horizontal locomotion, especially in small- to medium-sized primates and marsupials. Locomotion across sloped arboreal substrates, however, is poorly understood. Here, in order to determine which locomotor parameters a terrestrial mammal, the rat, and a tree-dwelling mammal, the European red squirrel, modify in response to differences in substrate orientation, three-dimensional kinematics were examined using biplanar videoradiography as the animals moved on 30 and 60 deg inclined branches. Our results revealed that to maintain stability and friction as well as balance during inclined branch locomotion, these species utilize comparable locomotor adjustments despite significant differences in travel speed and gait. Rats and European red squirrels increased limb flexion and retraction in order to bring the center of mass as close as possible to the substrate surface and to achieve maximum propulsion. Additionally, forelimbs were placed more laterally and underneath the branch whereas the hindlimbs were placed approximately on the top of the branch. These locomotor adjustments, which have also been observed in primates and marsupials, are independent of speed, morphological adaptations and limb proportions and thus might be strategies used by early mammals. Our results also suggest that mammals that lack, or have reduced, grasping abilities try to maintain the locomotor mode used during horizontal branch locomotion on inclined branches for as long as possible."},{"title":"Not all songbirds calibrate their magnetic compass from twilight cues: a telemetry study","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2540","abstract":"Migratory birds are able to use the sun and associated polarised light patterns, stellar cues and the geomagnetic field for orientation. No general agreement has been reached regarding the hierarchy of orientation cues.

Similar results have been shown in caged birds in a few studies but not confirmed in others. We report that free-flying European migrants, song thrushes Turdus philomelos, released after pre-exposure to a horizontally rotated magnetic field, do not recalibrate their magnetic compass from solar cues, but rather show a simple domination of either the magnetic or the stellar compass. We suggest that different songbird species possess different hierarchies of orientation cues, depending on the geographic and ecological challenges met by the migrants."},{"title":"Neuroepithelial cells and the hypoxia emersion response in the amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2560","abstract":"Teleost fish have oxygen-sensitive neuroepithelial cells (NECs) in the gills that appear to mediate physiological responses to hypoxia, but little is known about oxygen sensing in amphibious fish. The mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus, is an amphibious fish that respires via the gills and/or the skin. First, we hypothesized that both the skin and gills are sites of oxygen sensing in K. marmoratus. Serotonin-positive NECs were abundant in both gills and skin, as determined by immunohistochemical labelling and fluorescence microscopy. NECs retained synaptic vesicles and were found near nerve fibres labelled with the neuronal marker zn-12. Skin NECs were 42% larger than those of the gill, as estimated by measurement of projection area, and 45% greater in number. Moreover, for both skin and gill NECs, NEC area increased significantly (30–60%) following 7 days of exposure to hypoxia (1.5 mg l–1 dissolved oxygen). Another population of cells containing vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) proteins were also observed in the skin and gills. The second hypothesis we tested was that K. marmoratus emerse in order to breathe air cutaneously when challenged with severe aquatic hypoxia, and this response will be modulated by neurochemicals associated chemoreceptor activity. Acute exposure to hypoxia induced fish to emerse at 0.2 mg l–1. When K. marmoratus were pre-exposed to serotonin or acetylcholine, they emersed at a significantly higher concentration of oxygen than untreated fish. Pre-exposure to receptor antagonists (ketanserin and hexamethonium) predictably resulted in fish emersing at a lower concentration of oxygen. Taken together, these results suggest that oxygen sensing occurs at the branchial and/or cutaneous surfaces in K. marmoratus and that serotonin and acetylcholine mediate, in part, the emersion response."},{"title":"Light conditions affect sexual performance in a lekking tephritid fruit fly","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2595","abstract":"Sensory systems are very susceptible to early environment experience. Mating success depends on the transmission of information from the signaller to the receiver, which means that sensory biases caused by developmental environment are likely to affect sexual selection. We investigated the impact of the developmental visual environment (light spectrum) on male copulation behaviour and female preference in the lekking tephritid Anastrepha ludens. We reared flies in four different light spectrum conditions – red light, blue light, shaded light and darkness – during their first 16 days after emerging from pupae. We found that the light environment experienced during early adulthood affected mating frequency and, in some cases, the latency to copulate, but not copulation duration. Males exposed to any of the three light treatments (red, blue or shaded light) were more frequently chosen as mating partners than dark-reared males. Flies reared under dark conditions exhibited the lowest mating performance out of any of the rearing environments. Under field cage conditions, a slight assortative mating between blue- and red-light-reared flies was detected. Additionally, females reared in blue light and darkness mated less compared with females reared in red and shaded light. Our data demonstrate that male mating behaviour is flexible in response to light environment. The findings suggest that light spectrum only weakly affects the direction of sexual selection by female choice; however, dark rearing environments deeply affect mating success."},{"title":"Loading mechanics of the femur in tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) during terrestrial locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2603","abstract":"Salamanders are often used as representatives of the basal tetrapod body plan in functional studies, but little is known about the loads experienced by their limb bones during locomotion. Although salamanders' slow walking speeds might lead to low locomotor forces and limb bone stresses similar to those of non-avian reptiles, their highly sprawled posture combined with relatively small limb bones could produce elevated limb bone stresses closer to those of avian and mammalian species. This study evaluates the loads on the femur of the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) during terrestrial locomotion using three-dimensional measurements of the ground reaction force (GRF) and hindlimb kinematics, as well as anatomical measurements of the femur and hindlimb muscles. At peak stress (29.8±2.0% stance), the net GRF magnitude averaged 0.42 body weights and was directed nearly vertically for the middle 20–40% of the contact interval, essentially perpendicular to the femur. Although torsional shear stresses were significant (4.1±0.3 MPa), bending stresses experienced by the femur were low compared with other vertebrate lineages (tensile: 14.9±0.8 MPa; compressive: –18.9±1.0 MPa), and mechanical property tests indicated yield strengths that were fairly standard for tetrapods (157.1±3.7 MPa). Femoral bending safety factors (10.5) were considerably higher than values typical for birds and mammals, and closer to the elevated values calculated for reptilian species. These results suggest that high limb bone safety factors may have an ancient evolutionary history, though the underlying cause of high safety factors (e.g. low limb bone loads, high bone strength or a combination of the two) may vary among lineages."},{"title":"In vivo strains in the femur of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) during terrestrial locomotion: testing hypotheses of evolutionary shifts in mammalian bone loading and design","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2631","abstract":"Terrestrial locomotion can impose substantial loads on vertebrate limbs. Previous studies have shown that limb bones from cursorial species of eutherian mammals experience high bending loads with minimal torsion, whereas the limb bones of non-avian reptiles (and amphibians) exhibit considerable torsion in addition to bending. It has been hypothesized that these differences in loading regime are related to the difference in limb posture between upright mammals and sprawling reptiles, and that the loading patterns observed in non-avian reptiles may be ancestral for tetrapod vertebrates. To evaluate whether non-cursorial mammals show loading patterns more similar to those of sprawling lineages, we measured in vivo strains in the femur during terrestrial locomotion of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), a marsupial that uses more crouched limb posture than most mammals from which bone strains have been recorded, and which belongs to a clade phylogenetically between reptiles and the eutherian mammals studied previously. The presence of substantial torsion in the femur of opossums, similar to non-avian reptiles, would suggest that this loading regime likely reflects an ancestral condition for tetrapod limb bone design. Strain recordings indicate the presence of both bending and appreciable torsion (shear strain: 419.1±212.8 με) in the opossum femur, with planar strain analyses showing neutral axis orientations that placed the lateral aspect of the femur in tension at the time of peak strains. Such mediolateral bending was unexpected for a mammal running with near-parasagittal limb kinematics. Shear strains were similar in magnitude to peak compressive axial strains, with opossum femora experiencing similar bending loads but higher levels of torsion compared with most previously studied mammals. Analyses of peak femoral strains led to estimated safety factor ranges of 5.1–7.2 in bending and 5.5–7.3 in torsion, somewhat higher than typical mammalian values for bending, but approaching typical reptilian values for shear. Loading patterns of opossum limb bones therefore appear intermediate in some respects between those of eutherian mammals and non-avian reptiles, providing further support for hypotheses that high torsion and elevated limb bone safety factors may represent persistent ancestral conditions in the evolution of tetrapod limb bone loading and design."},{"title":"Locomotor loading mechanics in the hindlimbs of tegu lizards (Tupinambis merianae): comparative and evolutionary implications","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2616","abstract":"Skeletal elements are usually able to withstand several times their usual load before they yield, and this ratio is known as the bone's safety factor. Limited studies on amphibians and non-avian reptiles have shown that they have much higher limb bone safety factors than birds and mammals. It has been hypothesized that this difference is related to the difference in posture between upright birds and mammals and sprawling ectotherms; however, limb bone loading data from a wider range of sprawling species are needed in order to determine whether the higher safety factors seen in amphibians and non-avian reptiles are ancestral or derived conditions. Tegus (family Teiidae) are an ideal lineage with which to expand sampling of limb bone loading mechanics for sprawling taxa, particularly for lizards, because they are from a different clade than previously sampled iguanas and exhibit different foraging and locomotor habits (actively foraging carnivore versus burst-activity herbivore). We evaluated the mechanics of locomotor loading for the femur of the Argentine black and white tegu (Tupinambus merianae) using three-dimensional measurements of the ground reaction force and hindlimb kinematics, in vivo bone strains and femoral mechanical properties. Peak bending stresses experienced by the femur were low (tensile: 10.4±1.1 MPa; compressive: –17.4±0.9 MPa) and comparable to those in other reptiles, with moderate shear stresses and strains also present. Analyses of peak femoral stresses and strains led to estimated safety factor ranges of 8.8–18.6 in bending and 7.8–17.5 in torsion, both substantially higher than typical for birds and mammals but similar to other sprawling tetrapods. These results broaden the range of reptilian and amphibian taxa in which high femoral safety factors have been evaluated and further indicate a trend for the independent evolution of lower limb bone safety factors in endothermic taxa."},{"title":"Matching sender and receiver: poikilothermy and frequency tuning in a tree cricket","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2569","abstract":"Animals communicate in non-ideal and noisy conditions. The primary method they use to improve communication efficiency is sender-receiver matching: the receiver's sensory mechanism filters the impinging signal based on the expected signal. In the context of acoustic communication in crickets, such a match is made in the frequency domain. The males broadcast a mate attraction signal, the calling song, in a narrow frequency band centred on the carrier frequency (CF), and the females are most sensitive to sound close to this frequency. In tree crickets, however, the CF changes with temperature. The mechanisms used by female tree crickets to accommodate this change in CF were investigated at the behavioural and biomechanical level. At the behavioural level, female tree crickets were broadly tuned and responded equally to CFs produced within the naturally occurring range of temperatures (18 to 27°C). To allow such a broad response, however, the transduction mechanisms that convert sound into mechanical and then neural signals must also have a broad response. The tympana of the female tree crickets exhibited a frequency response that was even broader than suggested by the behaviour. Their tympana vibrate with equal amplitude to frequencies spanning nearly an order of magnitude. Such a flat frequency response is unusual in biological systems and cannot be modelled as a simple mechanical system. This feature of the tree cricket auditory system not only has interesting implications for mate choice and species isolation but may also prove exciting for bio-mimetic applications such as the design of miniature low frequency microphones."},{"title":"Evidence that potential fish predators elicit the production of carapace vibrations by the American lobster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2641","abstract":"American lobsters (Homarus americanus) will on rare occasions produce sounds by vibrating their dorsal carapace. Although this behavior can be elicited in the laboratory by handling lobsters, the stimulus that triggers the production of sounds in the lobster's natural habitat is not known. We investigated the influence of two fish that are known to prey on lobsters, cod (Gadus morhua) and striped bass (Morone saxatilis), on the production of sounds by American lobsters. In addition, we examined the response of the same fish to the sounds the lobsters produced. Although solitary lobsters spontaneously produced sounds at a low rate of 1.2±0.23 sound events per 30 min, the presence of a single cod or striped bass led to an increase in the rate of sound production (cod: 51.1±13.1 events per 30 min; striped bass: 17.0±7.0 events per 30 min). Most (74.6±6.6%) of the 292 sound events recorded occurred when a fish came within 0.5 m of a lobster, but a fish did not have to come into contact with a lobster to elicit sounds. Immediately following the production of a sound by a lobster, fish turned and swam away significantly faster than when they encountered a lobster that did not make a sound. Moreover, after striped bass (but not cod) experienced a number of these sound events, they subsequently tended to avoid swimming close to the lobsters. These data, taken together, suggest that sound production by American lobsters may serve to deter potential fish predators."},{"title":"Captivity induces hyper-inflammation in the house sparrow (Passer domesticus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2579","abstract":"Some species thrive in captivity but others exhibit extensive psychological and physiological deficits, which can be a challenge to animal husbandry and conservation as well as wild immunology. Here, we investigated whether captivity duration impacted the regulation of a key innate immune response, inflammation, of a common wild bird species, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). Inflammation is one of the most commonly induced and fast-acting immune responses animals mount upon exposure to a parasite. However, attenuation and resolution of inflammatory responses are partly coordinated by glucocorticoid hormones, hormones that can be disregulated in captivity. Here, we tested whether captivity duration alters corticosterone regulation and hence the inflammatory response by comparing the following responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a Gram-negative bacteria component that induces inflammation) of birds caught wild and injected immediately versus those held for 2 or 4 weeks in standard conditions: (1) the magnitude of leukocyte immune gene expression [the cytokines, interleukin 1β and interleukin 6, and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)], (2) the rate of clearance of endotoxin, and (3) the release of corticosterone (CORT) in response to endotoxin (LPS). We predicted that captivity duration would increase baseline CORT and thus suppress gene expression and endotoxin clearance rate. However, our predictions were not supported: TLR4 expression increased with time in captivity irrespective of LPS, and cytokine expression to LPS was stronger the longer birds remained captive. Baseline CORT was not affected by captivity duration, but CORT release post-LPS occurred only in wild birds. Lastly, sparrows held captive for 4 weeks maintained significantly higher levels of circulating endotoxin than other groups, perhaps due to leakage of microbes from the gut, but exogenous LPS did not increase circulating levels over the time scale samples were collected. Altogether, captivity appears to have induced a hyper-inflammatory state in house sparrows, perhaps due to disregulation of glucocorticoids, natural microflora or both."},{"title":"Functional impacts of ocean acidification in an ecologically critical foundation species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2586","abstract":"Anthropogenic CO2 is reducing the pH and altering the carbonate chemistry of seawater, with repercussions for marine organisms and ecosystems. Current research suggests that calcification will decrease in many species, but compelling evidence of impaired functional performance of calcium carbonate structures is sparse, particularly in key species. Here we demonstrate that ocean acidification markedly degrades the mechanical integrity of larval shells in the mussel Mytilus californianus, a critical community member on rocky shores throughout the northeastern Pacific. Larvae cultured in seawater containing CO2 concentrations expected by the year 2100 (540 or 970 ppm) precipitated weaker, thinner and smaller shells than individuals raised under present-day seawater conditions (380 ppm), and also exhibited lower tissue mass. Under a scenario where mussel larvae exposed to different CO2 levels develop at similar rates, these trends suggest a suite of potential consequences, including an exacerbated vulnerability of new settlers to crushing and drilling attacks by predators; poorer larval condition, causing increased energetic stress during metamorphosis; and greater risks from desiccation at low tide due to shifts in shell area to body mass ratios. Under an alternative scenario where responses derive exclusively from slowed development, with impacted individuals reaching identical milestones in shell strength and size by settlement, a lengthened larval phase could increase exposure to high planktonic mortality rates. In either case, because early life stages operate as population bottlenecks, driving general patterns of distribution and abundance, the ecological success of this vital species may be tied to how ocean acidification proceeds in coming decades."},{"title":"Deep-sea echinoderm oxygen consumption rates and an interclass comparison of metabolic rates in Asteroidea, Crinoidea, Echinoidea, Holothuroidea and Ophiuroidea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2512","abstract":"Echinoderms are important components of deep-sea communities because of their abundance and the fact that their activities contribute to carbon cycling. Estimating the echinoderm contribution to food webs and carbon cycling is important to our understanding of the functioning of the deep-sea environment and how this may alter in the future as climatic changes take place. Metabolic rate data from deep-sea echinoderm species are, however, scarce. To obtain such data from abyssal echinoderms, a novel in situ respirometer system, the benthic incubation chamber system (BICS), was deployed by remotely operated vehicle (ROV) at depths ranging from 2200 to 3600 m. Oxygen consumption rates were obtained in situ from four species of abyssal echinoderm (Ophiuroidea and Holothuroidea). The design and operation of two versions of BICS are presented here, together with the in situ respirometry measurements. These results were then incorporated into a larger echinoderm metabolic rate data set, which included the metabolic rates of 84 echinoderm species from all five classes (Asteroidea, Crinoidea, Echinoidea, Holothuroidea and Ophiuroidea). The allometric scaling relationships between metabolic rate and body mass derived in this study for each echinoderm class were found to vary. Analysis of the data set indicated no change in echinoderm metabolic rate with depth (by class or phylum). The allometric scaling relationships presented here provide updated information for mass-dependent deep-sea echinoderm metabolic rate for use in ecosystem models, which will contribute to the study of both shallow water and deep-sea ecosystem functioning and biogeochemistry."},{"title":"Sensory mediation of memory blocking stressors in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2528","abstract":"The great pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, is commonly used as a model species to study how stress affects the ability to form long-term memory (LTM); however, we still have little information about how the snail senses stressful stimuli. The osphradium is an external sensory organ that demonstrates electrophysiological responses to a variety of external chemical stimuli. We examined the role, if any, played by the osphradium in sensing two environmental stressors, crowding and low environmental calcium, both known to block LTM in intact animals. We severed the osphradial nerve, blocking external sensory input from this organ to the central nervous system, and then exposed the snails to low environmental calcium or crowding stress to assess whether these stressors continued to block LTM formation. When exposed to low environmental calcium, snails with their osphradial nerve severed responded as if they were maintained in our standard calcium environment. That is, they did not respond to low calcium as a stressor blocking LTM; therefore, the osphradium plays a crucial role in mediating how snails respond to this stressor. However, following crowding, LTM formation was blocked in both control groups and snails that had the osphradial nerve severed, indicating that sensory information from the osphradium is not required to sense crowded conditions. Together these data show that two stressors that result in the same behavioural phenotype, blocking LTM formation, do so via two distinct sensory pathways."},{"title":"Myostatin levels in skeletal muscle of hibernating ground squirrels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2522","abstract":"Myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle mass, is elevated during disuse and starvation. Mammalian hibernation presents a unique scenario, where animals are hypocaloric and in torpor, but the extent of muscle protein loss is minimized. We hypothesized that myostatin expression, which is usually increased early in disuse and under hypocaloric conditions, could be suppressed in this unique model. Skeletal muscle was collected from thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus, at six time points during hibernation: control euthermic (CON); entrance into hibernation (ENT), body temperature (Tb) falling; early hibernation (EHib), stable Tb in torpor for 24 h; late hibernation (LHib), stable Tb in torpor for 3 days; early arousal (EAr), Tb rising; and arousal (AR), Tb restored to 34–37°C for about 18 h. There was no significant increase of myostatin during ENT, EHib or LHib. Unexpectedly, there were approximately sixfold increases in myostatin protein levels as squirrels arose from torpor. The elevation during EAr remained high in AR, which represented an interbout time period. Mechanisms that could release the suppression or promote increased levels of myostatin were assessed. SMAD2 and phosphorylated SMAD2 were increased during EHib, but only the phosphorylated SMAD2 during AR mirrored increases in myostatin. Follistatin, a negative regulator of myostatin, did not follow the same time course as myostatin or its signaling pathway, indicating more control of myostatin at the signaling level. However, SMAD7, an inhibitory SMAD, did not appear to play a significant role during deep hibernation. Hibernation is an excellent natural model to study factors involved in the endogenous intracellular mechanisms controlling myostatin."},{"title":"Seasonal variation of long-term potentiation at a central synapse in the medicinal leech","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/2534","abstract":"Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent increase in synaptic transmission that is thought to contribute to a variety of adaptive processes including learning and memory. Although learning is known to undergo circannual variations, it is not known whether LTP undergoes similar changes despite the importance of LTP in learning and memory. Here we report that synapses in the CNS of the medicinal leech demonstrate seasonal variation in the capacity to undergo LTP following paired presynaptic and postsynaptic stimulation. LTP was observed during the April–October period, but no LTP was observed during the November–March period. Application of forskolin, a technique often used to produce chemical LTP, failed to elicit potentiation during the November–March period. Implementing stimulation patterns that normally result in long term depression (LTD) also failed to elicit any change in synaptic strength during the November–March period. These experiments indicate that LTP and LTD can be influenced by circannual rhythms and also suggest a seasonal influence on learning and memory."},{"title":"Movements of Rana catesbeiana tadpoles in weak current flows resemble a directed random walk","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2297","abstract":"Current flow is an important biological stimulus for larval anuran amphibians, but little is known about how it is perceived. We quantified behavioral responses to controlled water flow in the bullfrog tadpole (Rana catesbeiana) at developmental stages prior to metamorphic climax, and examined the contribution of a functioning lateral line system to these behaviors. Tadpoles at these developmental stages show a significant preference for the sides and bottom of a flow tank. In response to water flow at three different rates, they exhibit a significant, time-dependent tendency to move downstream, away from the source of the flow, and to remain in areas where flow is minimized. The consistency of these behaviors at all tested flow rates suggests that the animals are not simply passively pushed by the current; instead, they actively swim away from the current source. Tadpoles do not exhibit positive rheotaxis towards the source of the flow at any flow rate but as a group are randomly oriented. Treatment with cobalt chloride, a known blocker of superficial neuromast function, significantly reduces the tendency to move downstream, but does not alter the preference for the sides and bottom of the tank. Tadpoles' movements under flow are consistent with a model of locomotion based on a directed random walk."},{"title":"Plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase at the tissue of a teleost fish may greatly enhance oxygen delivery: in vitro evidence in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2319","abstract":"During a generalized acidosis in rainbow trout, catecholamines are released into the blood, activating red blood cell (RBC) Na+/H+ exchange (βNHE), thus protecting RBC intracellular pH (pHi) and subsequent O2 binding at the gill. Because of the presence of a Root effect (a reduction in oxygen carrying capacity of the blood with a reduction in pH), the latter could otherwise be impaired. However, plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase (CA) at the tissues (and absence at the gills) may result in selective short-circuiting of RBC βNHE pH regulation. This would acidify the RBCs and greatly enhance O2 delivery by exploitation of the combined Bohr-Root effect, a mechanism not previously proposed. As proof-of-principle, an in vitro closed system was developed to continuously monitor extracellular pH (pHe) and O2 tension (PO2) of rainbow trout blood. In this closed system, adding CA to acidified, adrenergically stimulated RBCs short-circuited βNHE pH regulation, resulting in an increase in PO2 by >30 mmHg, depending on the starting Hb-O2 saturation and degree of initial acidification. Interestingly, in the absence of adrenergic stimulation, addition of CA still elevated PO2, albeit to a lesser extent, a response that was absent during general NHE inhibition. If plasma-accessible CA-mediated short-circuiting is operational in vivo, the combined Bohr-Root effect system unique to teleost fishes could markedly enhance tissue O2 delivery far in excess of that in vertebrates possessing a Bohr effect alone and may lead to insights about the early evolution of the Root effect."},{"title":"Temperature-induced maternal effects and environmental predictability","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2329","abstract":"Maternal effects could influence the persistence of species under environmental change, but the adaptive significance of many empirically estimated maternal effects remains unclear. Inferences about the adaptive significance of maternal effects depend on the correlation between maternal and offspring environments, the relative importance of frequency- or density-dependent selection and whether absolute or relative fitness measures are used. Here, we combine the monitoring of the environment over time with a factorial experiment where we manipulated both the maternal and offspring environment in a marine bryozoan (Bugula neritina). We focused on temperature as our environmental variable as temperature commonly varies over short time scales in nature. We found that offspring from mothers kept in warmer water were smaller and more variable in size, but had increased dispersal potential and higher metamorphic success than offspring from mothers kept in cooler water. Our results suggest that, under frequency- or density-independent selection, mothers that experienced higher temperatures compared with lower temperatures were favoured. Under frequency- or density-dependent selection, there were indications that mothers that experienced higher temperatures would be favoured only if their offspring encountered similar (warmer) temperatures, though these results were not statistically significant. Analysis of time series data on temperature in the field shows that the maternal thermal environment is a good predictor of the temperatures offspring are likely to experience early in life. We suggest that future studies on maternal effects estimate environmental predictability and present both absolute and relative estimates of maternal fitness within each offspring environment."},{"title":"Transepithelial d-glucose and d-fructose transport across the American lobster, Homarus americanus, intestine","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2337","abstract":"Transepithelial transport of dietary d-glucose and d-fructose was examined in the lobster Homarus americanus intestine using d-[3H]glucose and d-[3H]fructose. Lobster intestines were mounted in a perfusion chamber to determine transepithelial mucosal to serosal (MS) and serosal to mucosal (SM) transport mechanisms of glucose and fructose. Both MS glucose and fructose transport, as functions of luminal sugar concentration, increased in a hyperbolic manner, suggesting the presence of mucosal transport proteins. Phloridizin inhibited the MS flux of glucose, but not that of fructose, suggesting the presence of a sodium-dependent (SGLT1)-like glucose co-transporter. Immunohistochemical analysis, using a goat anti-rabbit GLUT5 polyclonal antibody, revealed the localization of a brush border GLUT5-like fructose transport protein. MS fructose transport was decreased in the presence of mucosal phloretin in warm spring/summer animals, but the same effect was not observed in cold autumn/winter animals, suggesting a seasonal regulation of sugar transporters. Mucosal phloretin had no effect on MS glucose transport. Both SM glucose and SM fructose transport were decreased in the presence of increasing concentrations of serosal phloretin, providing evidence for the presence of a shared serosal GLUT2 transport protein for the two sugars. The transport of d-glucose and d-fructose across lobster intestine is similar to sugar uptake in mammalian intestine, suggesting evolutionarily conserved absorption processes for these solutes."},{"title":"Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors regulate paracellular permeability in a primary cultured gill epithelium","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2308","abstract":"The role of corticosteroid receptors (CRs) in the regulation of gill permeability was examined using a primary cultured trout gill epithelium. The epithelium expressed both glucocorticoid receptors (GR1 and GR2) and a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and cortisol treatment significantly increased transepithelial resistance (TER) and decreased paracellular [3H]PEG-4000 flux. Epithelial permeability was unaffected by deoxycorticosterone or aldosterone. The GR antagonist RU486 as well as MR antagonists spironolactone and RU26752 significantly reduced, but did not completely block, the effects of cortisol. The MR antagonist eplerenone was without effect. Only RU486 + spironolactone or RU486 + RU26752 treatment completely suppressed the effects of cortisol. On its own, RU486 had cortisol-like effects which could be blocked by spironolactone, suggesting that although RU486 is a GR antagonist, in this system it may also have agonistic properties that are mediated through the MR. The GR agonist dexamethasone increased TER and reduced [3H]PEG-4000 flux across cultured epithelia and was unaffected by MR antagonists. Therefore, alterations in transcript abundance of select tight junction (TJ) proteins were examined in response to cortisol, dexamethasone (a GR agonist) and RU486 (as a MR agonist). Occludin and claudin-7, -8d, -12 and -31 mRNA were significantly elevated in response to cortisol, dexamethasone or RU486 treatment. Claudin-3a mRNA was significantly elevated in response to cortisol or dexamethasone only, and claudin-28b and -30 mRNA were significantly altered following cortisol or RU486 treatment only. The data support a role for the GRs and MR in regulating gill permeability and suggest that TJ proteins are responsive to cortisol through both or individual CR types."},{"title":"Variation in metabolic rate of Anopheles gambiae and A. arabiensis in a Sahelian village","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2345","abstract":"In the Sahel, the Anopheles gambiae complex consists of Anopheles arabiensis and the M and S molecular forms of A. gambiae sensu stricto. However, the composition of these malaria vectors varies spatially and temporally throughout the region and is thought to be linked to environmental factors such as rainfall, larval site characteristics and duration of the dry season. To examine possible physiological divergence between these taxa, we measured metabolic rates of mosquitoes during the wet season in a Sahelian village in Mali. To our knowledge, this study provides the first measurements of metabolic rates of A. gambiae and A. arabiensis in the field. The mean metabolic rate of A. arabiensis was higher than that of M-form A. gambiae when accounting for the effects of female gonotrophic status, temperature and flight activity. However, after accounting for their difference in body size, no significant difference in metabolic rate was found between these two species (whilst all other factors were found to be significant). Thus, body size may be a key character that has diverged in response to ecological differences between these two species. Alternatively, these species may display additional differences in metabolic rate only during the dry season. Overall, our results indicate that changes in behavior and feeding activity provide an effective mechanism for mosquitoes to reduce their metabolic rate, and provide insight into the possible strategies employed by aestivating individuals during the dry season. We hypothesize that female mosquitoes switch to sugar feeding while in dormancy because of elevated metabolism associated with blood digestion."},{"title":"The broad range of contractile behaviour of the avian pectoralis: functional and evolutionary implications","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2354","abstract":"Wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) in birds combines the use of the wings and hindlimbs to ascend otherwise insurmountable obstacles. It is a means of escape in precocial birds before they are able to fly, and it is used by a variety of juvenile and adult birds as an alternative to flight for exploiting complex three-dimensional environments at the interface of the ground and air. WAIR and controlled flapping descent (CFD) are the bases of the ontogenetic-transitional wing hypothesis, wherein WAIR and CFD are proposed to be extant biomechanical analogs for incremental adaptive stages in the evolutionary origin of flight. A primary assumption of the hypothesis is that work and power requirements from the primary downstroke muscle, the pectoralis, incrementally increase from shallow- to steep-angled terrestrial locomotion, and between terrestrial and aerial locomotion. To test this assumption, we measured in vivo force, electromyographic (EMG) activity and length change in the pectoralis of pigeons (Columba livia) as the birds engaged in shallow and steep WAIR (65 and 85 deg, respectively) and in three modes of slow flight immediately following take-off: ascending at 80 deg, level and descending at –60 deg. Mean EMG amplitude, muscle stress, strain, work and power were minimal during shallow WAIR and increased stepwise from steep WAIR to descending flight and level flight to reach the highest levels during ascending flight. Relative to resting length of the pectoralis, fractional lengthening (maximum muscle strain) was similar among behaviors, but fractional shortening (minimum muscle strain) was absent during WAIR such that the pectoralis did not shorten to less than the resting length. These data dramatically extend the known range of in vivo contractile behavior for the pectoralis in birds. We conclude that WAIR remains a useful extant model for the evolutionary transition from terrestrial to aerial locomotion in birds because work and power requirements from the pectoralis increase incrementally during WAIR and from WAIR to flight."},{"title":"Jumping mechanisms and performance of snow fleas (Mecoptera, Boreidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2362","abstract":"Flightless snow fleas (snow scorpion flies, Mecoptera, Boreidae) live as adults during northern hemisphere winters, often jumping and walking on the surface of snow. Their jumping mechanisms and performance were analysed with high speed imaging. Jumps were propelled by simultaneous movements of both the middle and hind pairs of legs, as judged by the 0.2 ms resolution afforded by image rates of 5000 frames s–1. The middle legs of males represent 140% and the hindlegs 187% of the body length (3.4 mm), and the ratio of leg lengths is 1:1.3:1.7 (front:middle:hind). In preparation for a jump the middle legs and hindlegs were rotated forwards at their coxal joints with the fused mesothorax and metathorax. The first propulsive movement of a jump was the rotation of the trochantera about the coxae, powered by large depressor muscles within the thorax. The acceleration time was 6.6 ms. The fastest jump by a male had a take-off velocity of 1 m s–1, which required 1.1 μJ of energy and a power output of 0.18 mW, and exerted a force about 16 times its body weight. Jump distances of about 100 mm were unaffected by temperature. This, and the power per mass of muscle requirement of 740 W kg–1, suggests that a catapult mechanism is used. The elastic protein resilin was revealed in four pads at the articulation of the wing hinge with the dorsal head of the pleural ridge of each middle leg and hindleg. By contrast, fleas, which use just their hindlegs for jumping, have only two pads of resilin. This, therefore, provides a functional reference point for considerations about the phylogenetic relationships between snow fleas and true fleas."},{"title":"Anterior lateral eyes of Lycosa tarantula (Araneae: Lycosidae) are used during orientation to detect changes in the visual structure of the substratum","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2375","abstract":"Previous studies in the wolf spider Lycosa tarantula (Linnaeus 1758) have shown that homing is carried out by path integration and that, in the absence of information relative to the sun's position or any pattern of polarized light, L. tarantula obtains information as to the angle it must turn to home through the anterior lateral eyes (ALEs). In the present study, spiders were trained to walk over a black-and-white grating and afterwards tested either over a white substratum, the same substratum used for training or the same substratum rotated 90 deg (two groups: ALEs covered and only ALEs uncovered; they were tested first without their eyes covered and then with their eyes covered). The directional bearing was measured both in training and test conditions. Under the white or the same substratum in test conditions, the directional bearing had the same mean direction and a distribution similar to that of the training sessions. When the substratum was rotated 90 deg, the directional bearing had the same mean direction but the distribution was significantly different from that of the training sessions. Moreover, if ALEs were covered, spiders behaved as if the substratum had not been rotated and the directional bearing distribution was similar to that of the training sessions. But, if ALEs were the only eyes uncovered, spiders behaved as if no eyes were covered and directional bearing distribution was similar to that of the test condition. It is suggested that, when homing, L. tarantula uses both idiothetic information and visual information gathered through ALEs. These findings present the first evidence that spiders can use the visual structure of the substratum to return home."},{"title":"Building a robotic link between muscle dynamics and hydrodynamics","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2381","abstract":"This study used a novel feedback approach to control a robotic foot using force and length signals transmitted from an isolated Xenopus laevis frog muscle. The foot's environment (inertial versus hydrodynamic), gearing (outlever/inlever) and size were changed to alter the muscle's load. Upon nerve stimulation (250 Hz, 80 ms train duration), variation in loading generated a range of muscle stress (19.8±5.3 to 66.0±22.5 kPa), work (1.89±0.67 to 6.87±2.96 J kg–1 muscle) and power (12.4±7.5 to 64.8±28.3 W kg–1 muscle; mean ± s.d., N=6 frogs). Inertial versus hydrodynamic loading dramatically shifted contractile dynamics. With the foot in water, the muscle generated ∼30% higher force, yet shortened slower, producing lower power than inertial loading. Power increased in air from 22.6±5.8 to 63.6±27.2 W kg–1 muscle in response to doubling the gear ratio, but did not increase in water. Surprisingly, altering foot size diminished muscle performance in water, causing power to drop significantly from 41.6±11.1 to 25.1±8.0 W kg–1 muscle as foot area was doubled. Thus, morphological modifications influenced muscle dynamics independently of neural control; however, changes in loading environment and gearing affected contractile output more strongly than changes in foot size. Confirming recent theory, these findings demonstrate how muscle contractile output can be modulated solely by altering the mechanical environment."},{"title":"Hyperbaric computed tomographic measurement of lung compression in seals and dolphins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2390","abstract":"Lung compression of vertebrates as they dive poses anatomical and physiological challenges. There has been little direct observation of this. A harbor and a gray seal, a common dolphin and a harbor porpoise were each imaged post mortem under pressure using a radiolucent, fiberglass, water-filled pressure vessel rated to a depth equivalent of 170 m. The vessel was scanned using computed tomography (CT), and supported by a rail and counterweighted carriage magnetically linked to the CT table movement. As pressure increased, total buoyancy of the animals decreased and lung tissue CT attenuation increased, consistent with compression of air within the lower respiratory tract. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the external surface of the porpoise chest showed a marked contraction of the chest wall. Estimation of the volumes of different body compartments in the head and chest showed static values for all compartments except the lung, which showed a pressure-related compression. The depth of estimated lung compression ranged from 58 m in the gray seal with lungs inflated to 50% total lung capacity (TLC) to 133 m in the harbor porpoise with lungs at 100% TLC. These observations provide evidence for the possible behavior of gas within the chest of a live, diving mammal. The estimated depths of full compression of the lungs exceeds previous indirect estimates of the depth at which gas exchange ceases, and concurs with pulmonary shunt measurements. If these results are representative for living animals, they might suggest a potential for decompression sickness in diving mammals."},{"title":"A tale of three taxes: photo-gyro-gravitactic bioconvection","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2398","abstract":"The term bioconvection encapsulates the intricate patterns in concentration, due to hydrodynamic instabilities, that may arise in suspensions of non-neutrally buoyant, biased swimming microorganisms. The directional bias may be due to light (phototaxis), gravity (gravitaxis), a combination of viscous and gravitational torques (gyrotaxis) or other taxes. The aim of this study is to quantify experimentally the wavelength of the initial pattern to form from an initially well-mixed suspension of unicellular, swimming green algae as a function of concentration and illumination. As this is the first such study, it is necessary to develop a robust and meticulous methodology to achieve this end. The phototactic, gyrotactic and gravitactic alga Chlamydomonas augustae was employed, with various red or white light intensities from above or below, as the three not altogether separable taxes were probed. Whilst bioconvection was found to be unresponsive to changes in red light, intriguing trends were found for pattern wavelength as a function of white light intensity, depending critically on the orientation of the illumination. These trends are explored to help unravel the mechanisms. Furthermore, comparisons are made with theoretical predictions of initial wavelengths from a recent model of photo-gyrotaxis, encouragingly revealing good qualitative agreement."},{"title":"Audiogram of a stranded Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris) measured using auditory evoked potentials","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2409","abstract":"Quantifying and understanding the impact of anthropogenic sound on marine mammals has been the focus of many researchers both in laboratory settings as well as in the field.

The audiogram data indicated that the region of best hearing was found between 40 and 50 kHz with thresholds below 50 dB. This frequency range partially overlaps with the frequency modulated upsweep that Blainville's beaked whales have been reported to use during echolocation.

Defeated males avoid their victorious adversaries for several hours before regaining aggressiveness. However, the defeated male does not regain aggressiveness if repeated fighting occurs. Loss of individual aggressiveness is limited by group size, which constrains the number of crickets fighting at any given time. Thus, group aggressive behaviour is modulated by an environmental factor, group size, which is ultimately determined by individual actions, i.e. fighting between two individuals. We developed a robot model to elucidate the mechanism of group-size-dependent behaviour alternation in crickets. The behaviour of individual robots was evaluated experimentally with mobile robots and the group behaviour of the robots was evaluated by computer simulation. We demonstrated that the group-size-dependent strategy in crickets could be generated by local interactions between robots, where the behaviour was governed by an oscillator and memory of the outcome of previous fights."},{"title":"Changes in gill H+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase expression and activity during freshwater acclimation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2435","abstract":"Few studies have examined changes in salmon gill ion transporter expression during the transition from seawater to freshwater, a pivotal moment in the salmonid life cycle. Seawater-acclimated Atlantic salmon were transferred to freshwater and blood and gill tissue were sampled over 30 days of acclimation. Salmon held in seawater had stable plasma osmolality and sodium and chloride levels throughout the experiment. Following freshwater exposure, plasma sodium and chloride levels and total osmolality decreased significantly before returning towards control levels over time. Gill H+-ATPase activity increased by more than 45% 14 days after exposure to freshwater, whereas H+-ATPase mRNA levels were not affected by the salinity change. Within 4 days of freshwater exposure, gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity increased ∼43% over control levels, remaining significantly higher until the 30 day sampling group when it declined back to control levels. This increase in activity was associated with a more than 7-fold increase in Na+/K+-ATPase isoform α1a mRNA level and a ∼60% decrease in Na+/K+-ATPase isoform β1b mRNA level. The mRNA levels of Na+/K+-ATPase isoforms α1c and α3 did not change as a result of freshwater exposure. The time courses for mRNA expression of the small membrane protein FXYD 11 and the β1-subunit were very similar, with levels increasing significantly 7 days following freshwater exposure before subsiding back to control levels at 30 days. Taken together, these data suggest an important role for Na+/K+-ATPase in freshwater acclimation in Atlantic salmon."},{"title":"Honeybee flight: a novel ‘streamlining’ response","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2215","abstract":"Animals that move rapidly through the air can save considerable energy by reducing the drag that they need to overcome during flight. We describe a novel ‘streamlining’ response in tethered, flying honeybees in which the abdomen is held in a raised position when the visual system is exposed to a pattern of image motion that is characteristic of forward flight. This visually evoked response, which can be elicited without exposing the insect to any airflow, presumably serves to reduce the aerodynamic drag that would otherwise be produced by the abdomen during real flight. The response is critically dependent on the presence of appropriate image motion everywhere within the large field of view of the insect. Thus, our results also underscore the importance of using panoramic stimulation for the study of visually guided flight in insects, and reveal the relative importance of various regions of the visual field in assessing the speed of flight through the environment."},{"title":"Electrolocation based on tail-bending movements in weakly electric fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2443","abstract":"Weakly electric fish generate an electric field with their electric organ to navigate in space, detect objects and communicate with conspecifics. Several studies have examined how electric fish identify objects with their electroreceptors and use electric images for electrolocation. It has been argued that sensor readings from electroreceptors along the rostrocaudal line allow fish to determine the location of a target object. It is well known that the ratio between the maximal slope and the maximal amplitude of the electric image can allow the discrimination of object distances, regardless of object size and conductivity. In order to understand the temporal pattern of electric images, we used a model of electric field perturbation. Using the model, we suggest that the temporal pattern generated at an electrosensor during tail bending is another cue that can be used by the fish to discriminate object distances. The time course of electric sensor signals from a specific electroreceptor when tail-bending movements are applied can provide information about the lateral distance of a target object."},{"title":"Constraints on the adhesion of viscous threads spun by orb-weaving spiders: the tensile strength of glycoprotein glue exceeds its adhesion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2237","abstract":"In this study we tested the hypothesis that a viscous thread releases its hold on a surface because its glycoprotein glue pulls from the surface and not because its elongating droplets break near their attachment to the surface. We compared the values obtained when three species' viscous threads adhered to four smooth surfaces, which differed in their total surface energy and in the proportions of their dispersion and polar energy components. Although water comprised 43–70% of the volume of these viscous droplets, only the dispersion surface energies of test materials and not their polar surface energies impacted thread adhesion. These results support the droplet pull-off hypothesis and are consistent with a previous finding that capillary force contributes little to thread adhesion. Just as a viscous thread's stickiness is constrained by the tensile strength of its supporting axial fibers, our findings suggest that glycoprotein adhesion is constrained by glycoprotein tensile strength."},{"title":"Hypothalamic neuropeptides, not leptin sensitivity, contributes to the hyperphagia in lactating Brandt's voles, Lasiopodomys brandtii","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2242","abstract":"Both pregnancy and lactation are associated with hyperphagia, and circulating leptin levels are elevated during pregnancy but decreased during lactation in Brandt's voles, Lasiopodomys brandtii.

The serum leptin level and mRNA expression of the long form of the leptin receptor (Ob-Rb), suppressor-of-cytokine-signalling-3 (SOCS-3), neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AgRP), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) in the hypothalamus were examined on dioestrous, day 5, day 17 of lactation and day 27 (1 week after weaning) in Brandt's voles. Compared with controls, hypothalamic Ob-Rb and SOCS-3 mRNA expression was not significantly changed during lactation. The serum leptin level was significantly lower in lactating females than in the non-reproductive group. Hypothalamic NPY and AgRP mRNA expression significantly increased whereas POMC mRNA expression was significantly decreased during lactation compared with controls. However, there were no significant changes in hypothalamic CART mRNA expression. Food intake was positively correlated with NPY and AgRP mRNA expression but negatively correlated with POMC mRNA expression during lactation. These data suggest that hyperphagia during lactation was associated with low leptin levels, but not impaired leptin sensitivity, and that the hypothalamic neuropeptides NPY, AgRP and POMC are involved in mediating the role of leptin in food intake regulation in lactating Brandt's voles."},{"title":"Effects of shell morphology on mechanics of zebra and quagga mussel locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2226","abstract":"Although zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) initially colonized shallow habitats within the North American Great Lakes, quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis) are becoming dominant in both shallow- and deep-water habitats. Shell morphology differs among zebra, shallow quagga and deep quagga mussels but functional consequences of such differences are unknown. We examined effects of shell morphology on locomotion for the three morphotypes on hard (typical of shallow habitats) and soft (characteristic of deep habitats) sedimentary substrates. We quantified morphology using the polar moment of inertia, a parameter used in calculating kinetic energy that describes shell area distribution and resistance to rotation. We quantified mussel locomotion by determining the ratio of rotational (Krot) to translational kinetic energy (Ktrans). On hard substrate, Krot:Ktrans of deep quagga mussels was fourfold greater than for the other morphotypes, indicating greater energy expenditure in rotation relative to translation. On soft substrate, Krot:Ktrans of deep quagga mussels was approximately one-third of that on hard substrate, indicating lower energy expenditure in rotation on soft substrate. Overall, our study demonstrates that shell morphology correlates with differences in locomotion (i.e. Krot:Ktrans) among morphotypes. Although deep quagga mussels were similar to zebra and shallow quagga mussels in terms of energy expenditure on sedimentary substrate, their morphology was energetically maladaptive for linear movement on hard substrate. As quagga mussels can possess two distinct morphotypes (i.e. shallow and deep morphs), they might more effectively utilize a broader range of substrates than zebra mussels, potentially enhancing their ability to colonize a wider range of habitats."},{"title":"In ovo thyroxine exposure alters later UVS cone loss in juvenile rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2248","abstract":"Thyroid hormones (THs) play a vital role in vertebrate neural development, and, together with the beta isoform of the thyroid hormone receptor (TRβ), the development and differentiation of cone photoreceptors in the vertebrate retina. Rainbow trout undergo a natural process of cone cell degeneration during development and this change in photoreceptor distribution is regulated by thyroxine (T4; a thyroid hormone). In an effort to further understand the role of T4 in photoreceptor ontogeny and later developmental changes in photoreceptor subtype distribution, the influence of enhanced in ovo T4 content on the onset of opsin expression and cone development was examined. Juvenile trout reared from the initial in ovo-treated embryos were challenged with exogenous T4 at the parr stage of development to determine if altered embryonic exposure to yolk THs would affect later T4-induced short-wavelength-sensitive (SWS1) opsin transcript downregulation and ultraviolet-sensitive (UVS) cone loss. In ovo TH manipulation led to upregulation of both SWS1 and long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsin transcripts in the pre-hatch rainbow trout retina and to changes in the relative expression of TRβ. After 7 days of exposure to T4, juveniles that were also treated with T4 in ovo had greatly reduced SWS1 expression levels and premature loss of UVS cones relative to T4-treated juveniles raised from untreated eggs. These results suggest that changes in egg TH levels can have significant consequences much later in development, particularly in the retina."},{"title":"Microstome–macrostome transformation in the polymorphic ciliate Tetrahymena vorax leads to mechanosensitivity associated with prey-capture behaviour","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2258","abstract":"Ciliates feed by phagocytosis. Some ciliate species, such as Tetrahymena vorax, are polymorphic, a strategy that provides more flexible food utilization. Cells of the microstomal morph of T. vorax feed on bacteria, organic particles and organic solutes in a non-selective manner, whereas macrostome cells are predators that consume specific prey ciliates. In the present study, we investigated a possible correlation between phagocytosis and mechanosensitivity in macrostome T. vorax. Microstome cells seem to be insensitive to mechanical stimulation whereas macrostome cells depolarise in response to mechanical stimulation of the anterior part of the cell. The amplitude of the receptor potential induced by either a prey ciliate or a 5 μm push by a glass needle was sufficient to elicit a regenerative Ca2+ spike. The difference in mechanosensitivity of the two forms correlates with the swimming behaviour when hitting an obstacle; microstome cells swim alongside the obstacle whereas macrostome cells swim backwards, turn and resume forward swimming. Macrostome cells prevented from backward swimming and the subsequent turn failed to capture prey cells in their pouch. Macrostome cells consumed heterospecific prey ciliates preferentially over conspecific microstome cells. This selectivity is not due to electrical membrane responses elicited by physical contact. Both microstome and macrostome cells accumulated in an area containing putative substances released from heterospecific prey ciliates, but the substances did not elicit any electrophysiological membrane responses. We conclude that the mechanosensitivity of macrostome cells is associated with the prey-capture behaviour, whereas the selective phagocytosis is probably due to chemo-attraction to heterospecific prey ciliates."},{"title":"Dive behaviour impacts the ability of heart rate to predict oxygen consumption in Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) foraging at depth","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2267","abstract":"The predictive relationship between heart rate (fH) and oxygen consumption (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/214/13/2267/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>) has been derived for several species of marine mammals swimming horizontally or diving in tanks to shallow depths.

The intestinal content at satiety (6.3% body mass) decreased by 50% at 3 h and 95% at 9 h following food withdrawal. Phosphorylation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling protein Akt peaked within 3 h of feeding and was highly correlated with gut fullness. Retained paralogues of IGF hormones genes were regulated with feeding, with igf1a showing a pronounced peak in expression after 3 h and igf2b after 6 h. Igf-I receptor transcripts were markedly elevated with fasting, and decreased to their lowest levels 45 min after feeding. igf1rb transcripts increased more quickly than igf1ra transcripts as the gut emptied. Paralogues of the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) were constitutively expressed, except for igfbp1a and igfbp1b transcripts, which were significantly elevated with fasting. Genome-wide transcriptional responses were analysed using the Agilent 44K oligonucleotide microarray and selected genes validated by qPCR. Fasting was associated with the upregulation of genes for the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic genes. Protein chaperones (unc45b, hspd1, hspa5, hsp90a.1, hsp90a.2) and chaperone interacting proteins (ahsa1 and stip1) were upregulated 3 h after feeding along with genes for the initiation of protein synthesis and mRNA processing. Transcripts for the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase 1 showed the largest increase with feeding (11.5-fold) and were positively correlated with gut fullness. This study demonstrates the fast nature of the transcriptional responses to a meal and provides evidence for differential regulation of retained paralogues of IGF signalling pathway genes."},{"title":"Optimal walking speed following changes in limb geometry","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2276","abstract":"The principle of dynamic similarity states that the optimal walking speeds of geometrically similar animals are independent of size when speed is normalized to the dimensionless Froude number (Fr). Furthermore, various studies have shown similar dimensionless optimal speed (Fr ∼0.25) for animals with quite different limb geometries. Here, we wondered whether the optimal walking speed of humans depends solely on total limb length or whether limb segment proportions play an essential role. If optimal walking speed solely depends on the limb length then, when subjects walk on stilts, they should consume less metabolic energy at a faster optimal speed than when they walk without stilts. To test this prediction, we compared kinematics, electromyographic activity and oxygen consumption in adults walking on a treadmill at different speeds with and without articulated stilts that artificially elongated the shank segment by 40 cm. Walking on stilts involved a non-linear reorganization of kinematic and electromyography patterns. In particular, we found a significant increase in the alternating activity of proximal flexors–extensors during the swing phase, despite significantly shorter normalized stride lengths. The minimal metabolic cost per unit distance walked with stilts occurred at roughly the same absolute speed, corresponding to a lower Fr number (Fr ∼0.17) than in normal walking (Fr ∼0.25). These findings are consistent with an important role of limb geometry optimization and kinematic coordination strategies in minimizing the energy expenditure of human walking."},{"title":"Characteristics of vortex formation and thrust performance in drag-based paddling propulsion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2283","abstract":"Several characteristics of drag-based paddling propulsion are studied with a simple mechanical model and a measurement technique for mapping three-dimensional flow fields. In drag-based propulsion, the temporal change of the vortex strength is an important parameter in the relationship between vortex formation and thrust generation. Our results indicate that spanwise flow behind the paddling propulsor significantly affects tip vortex development and thrust generation. The distribution of spanwise flow is dependent on the propulsor shape and the Reynolds number. A delta-shaped propulsor generates strong spanwise flow compared with a rectangular propulsor. For the low Reynolds number case, spanwise flow is not as strong as that for the high Reynolds number case. Without sacrificing total impulse, the flexible propulsor can smooth out thrust peaks during sudden stroke motions, which is favorable for avoiding structural failures and stabilizing body motion. We also explored the role of stopping vortex shedding in efficient thrust generation by determining the relationship between stroke angles and total impulses generated by paddling propulsors."},{"title":"Renal responses to salinity change in snakes with and without salt glands","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2140","abstract":"To understand renal responses to salinity change in aquatic reptiles, we examined the structure and function of the kidney in three species of snake: a marine species with a salt gland (Laticauda semifasciata), a marine species without a salt gland (Nerodia clarkii clarkii) and a freshwater species without a salt gland (Nerodia fasciata). Both marine species maintained relatively constant plasma ions, even after acclimation to saltwater. By contrast, both plasma Cl– and mortality increased with salinity in the freshwater species. To investigate putative renal ion regulatory mechanisms, we examined the distribution and abundance of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and the Na+/K+/2Cl– cotransporter (NKCC2). In all species, NKA localized to the basolateral membranes of the distal tubule and the connecting segments and collecting ducts only; there was no effect of salinity on the distribution of NKA or on the abundance of NKA mRNA in any species. NKCC2 protein was undetectable in the kidney of any of the species and there was no effect of salinity on NKCC2 mRNA abundance. We also examined the distribution and abundance of aquaporin 3 (AQP3) in the kidney of these species; although putative AQP3 localized to the basolateral membranes of the connecting segments and collecting ducts of all three species, there was no effect of salinity on the localization of the protein or the abundance of the transcript. Interestingly, we found very few differences across species, suggesting that the snake kidney may play a trivial role in limiting habitat use."},{"title":"Physiological adaptation of an Antarctic Na+/K+-ATPase to the cold","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2164","abstract":"Because enzymatic activity is strongly suppressed by the cold, polar poikilotherms face significant adaptive challenges. For example, at 0°C the catalytic activity of a typical enzyme from a temperate organism is reduced by more than 90%. Enzymes embedded in the plasma membrane, such as the Na+/K+-ATPase, may be even more susceptible to the cold because of thermal effects on the lipid bilayer. Accordingly, adaptive changes in response to the cold may include adjustments to the enzyme or the surrounding lipid environment, or synergistic changes to both. To assess the contribution of the enzyme itself, we cloned orthologous Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunits from an Antarctic (Pareledone sp.; –1.8°C) and a temperate octopus (Octopus bimaculatus; ∼18°C), and compared their turnover rates and temperature sensitivities in a heterologous expression system. The primary sequences of the two pumps were found to be highly similar (97% identity), with most differences being conservative changes involving hydrophobic residues. The physiology of the pumps was studied using an electrophysiological approach in intact Xenopus oocytes. The voltage dependence of the pumps was equivalent. However, at room temperature the maximum turnover rate of the Antarctic pump was found to be 25% higher than that of the temperate pump. In addition, the Antarctic pump exhibited a lower temperature sensitivity, leading to significantly higher relative activity at lower temperatures. Orthologous Na+/K+ pumps were then isolated from two tropical and two Arctic octopus. The temperature sensitivities of these pumps closely matched those of the temperate and Antarctic pumps, respectively. Thus, reduced thermal sensitivity appears to be a common mechanism driving cold adaptation in the Na+/K+-ATPase."},{"title":"Decreased hydrophobicity of iridescent feathers: a potential cost of shiny plumage","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2157","abstract":"Honest advertisement models posit that sexually selected traits are costly to produce, maintain or otherwise bear. Brightly coloured feathers are thought to be classic examples of these models, but evidence for a cost in feathers not coloured by carotenoid pigments is scarce. Unlike pigment-based colours, iridescent feather colours are produced by light scattering in modified feather barbules that are characteristically flattened and twisted towards the feather surface. These modifications increase light reflectance, but also expose more surface area for water adhesion, suggesting a potential trade-off between colour and hydrophobicity. Using light microscopy, spectrometry, contact angle goniometry and self-cleaning experiments, we show that iridescent feathers of mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, are less hydrophobic than adjacent non-iridescent feathers, and that this is primarily caused by differences in barbule microstructure. Furthermore, as a result of this decreased hydrophobicity, iridescent feathers are less efficient at self-cleaning than non-iridescent feathers. Together, these results suggest a previously unforeseen cost of iridescent plumage traits that may help to explain the evolution and distribution of iridescence in birds."},{"title":"The diving bell and the spider: the physical gill of Argyroneta aquatica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2175","abstract":"Argyroneta aquatica is a unique air-breathing spider that lives virtually its entire life under freshwater. It creates a dome-shaped web between aquatic plants and fills the diving bell with air carried from the surface. The bell can take up dissolved O2 from the water, acting as a ‘physical gill’. By measuring bell volume and O2 partial pressure (PO2) with tiny O2-sensitive optodes, this study showed that the spiders produce physical gills capable of satisfying at least their resting requirements for O2 under the most extreme conditions of warm stagnant water. Larger spiders produced larger bells of higher O2 conductance (GO2). GO2 depended on surface area only; effective boundary layer thickness was constant. Bells, with and without spiders, were used as respirometers by measuring GO2 and the rate of change in PO2. Metabolic rates were also measured with flow-through respirometry. The water–air PO2 difference was generally less than 10 kPa, and spiders voluntarily tolerated low internal PO2 approximately 1–4 kPa before renewal with air from the surface. The low PO2 in the bell enhanced N2 loss from the bell, but spiders could remain inside for more than a day without renewal. Spiders appeared to enlarge the bells in response to higher O2 demands and lower aquatic PO2."},{"title":"No apparent ecological trend to the flight-initiating jump performance of five bat species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2182","abstract":"The jump performance of five insectivorous bat species (Miniopterus schreibersii, Myotis blythii, Myotis capaccinii, Myotis myotis and Rhinolophus blasii) was filmed using a high-speed camera. All study bats jumped using a similar technique, with the wing musculature providing the force. The bats jumped off the wrist joint of their wings, typically with their feet already off the ground. Contrary to expectations, jump performance did not correlate with ecology and was instead strongly determined by body size. In general, the larger bats produced more jump force, left the ground at higher speeds and jumped higher than the smaller bats. The differences in force production disappeared when the data were corrected for body size, with the exception of Myotis capaccinii, which produced significantly less force. Scaling of jump performance with body size measured here was compared against two existing muscle performance scaling models. The model suggesting that muscle contraction velocity is proportional to muscle length was better supported than that based on muscle cross-sectional area. Both models, however, failed to accurately predict the scaling of jump forces, with the slope of the relationship being significantly steeper than predicted, highlighting the need for further investigations of vertebrate muscle performance scaling. The results of this study indicate that a bat's jumping ability is a secondary locomotor ability that uses the strongly selected-for flight apparatus with no apparent ecological trend present, i.e. flight so dominates bat locomotor morphology that other locomotor abilities tend to be derivative."},{"title":"How do tiger moths jam bat sonar?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/14/2416","abstract":"The tiger moth Bertholdia trigona is the only animal in nature known to defend itself by jamming the sonar of its predators – bats. In this study we analyzed the three-dimensional flight paths and echolocation behavior of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) attacking B. trigona in a flight room over seven consecutive nights to determine the acoustic mechanism of the sonar-jamming defense. Three mechanisms have been proposed: (1) the phantom echo hypothesis, which states that bats misinterpret moth clicks as echoes; (2) the ranging interference hypothesis, which states that moth clicks degrade the bats' precision in determining target distance; and (3) the masking hypothesis, which states that moth clicks mask the moth echoes entirely, making the moth temporarily invisible. On nights one and two of the experiment, the bats appeared startled by the clicks; however, on nights three through seven, the bats frequently missed their prey by a distance predicted by the ranging interference hypothesis (∼15–20 cm). Three-dimensional simulations show that bats did not avoid phantom targets, and the bats' ability to track clicking prey contradicts the predictions of the masking hypothesis. The moth clicks also forced the bats to reverse their stereotyped pattern of echolocation emissions during attack, even while bats continued pursuit of the moths. This likely further hinders the bats' ability to track prey. These results have implications for the evolution of sonar jamming in tiger moths, and we suggest evolutionary pathways by which sonar jamming may have evolved from other tiger moth defense mechanisms."},{"title":"Energetics of burrowing by the cirratulid polychaete Cirriformia moorei","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2202","abstract":"Burrowing through marine sediments has been considered to be much more energetically expensive than other forms of locomotion, but previous studies were based solely on external work calculations and lacked an understanding of the mechanical responses of sediments to forces applied by burrowers. Muddy sediments are elastic solids through which worms extend crack-shaped burrows by fracture. Here we present data on energetics of burrowing by Cirriformia moorei. We calculated the external energy per distance traveled from the sum of the work to extend the burrow by fracture and the elastic work done to displace sediment as a worm moves into the newly formed burrow to be 9.7 J kg–1 m–1 in gelatin and 64 J kg–1 m–1 in sediment, much higher than for running or walking. However, because burrowing worms travel at slow speeds, the increase in metabolic rate due to burrowing is predicted to be small. We tested this prediction by measuring aerobic metabolism (oxygen consumption rates) and anaerobic metabolism (concentrations of the anaerobic metabolite tauropine and the energy-storage molecule phosphocreatine) of C. moorei. None of these components was significantly different between burrowing and resting worms, and the low increases in oxygen consumption rates or tauropine concentrations predicted from external work calculations were within the variability observed across individuals. This result suggests that the energy to burrow, which could come from aerobic or anaerobic sources, is not a substantial component of the total metabolic energy of a worm. Burrowing incurs a low cost per unit of time."},{"title":"The influence of trout cardiac troponin I and PKA phosphorylation on the Ca2+ affinity of the cardiac troponin complex","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/1981","abstract":"The trout heart is 10-fold more sensitive to Ca2+ than the mammalian heart. This difference is due, in part, to cardiac troponin C (cTnC) from trout having a greater Ca2+ affinity than human cTnC. To determine what other proteins are involved, we cloned cardiac troponin I (cTnI) from the trout heart and determined how it alters the Ca2+ affinity of a cTn complex containing all mammalian components (mammalian cTn). Ca2+ activation of the complex was characterized using a human cTnC mutant that contains anilinonapthalenesulfote iodoacetamide attached to Cys53. When the cTn complex containing labeled human cTnC was titrated with Ca2+, its fluorescence changed, reaching an asymptote upon saturation. Our results reveal that trout cTnI lacks the N-terminal extension found in cTnI from all other vertebrate groups. This protein domain contains two targets (Ser23 and Ser24) for protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C. When these are phosphorylated, the rate of cardiomyocyte relaxation increases. When rat cTnI in the mammalian cTn complex was replaced with trout cTnI, the Ca2+ affinity was increased ∼1.8-fold. This suggests that trout cTnI contributes to the high Ca2+ sensitivity of the trout heart. Treatment of the two cTn complexes with PKA decreased the Ca2+ affinity of both complexes. However, the change for the complex containing rat cTnI was 2.2-fold that of the complex containing trout cTnI. This suggests that the phosphorylation of trout cTnI does not play as significant a role in regulating cTn function in trout."},{"title":"Perch size and structure have species-dependent effects on the arboreal locomotion of rat snakes and boa constrictors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/13/2189","abstract":"Arboreal habitats create diverse challenges for animal locomotion, but the numerical and phylogenetic diversity of snakes that climb trees suggest that their overall body plan is well suited for this task. Snakes have considerable diversity of axial anatomy, but the functional consequences of this diversity for arboreal locomotion are poorly understood because of the lack of comparative data. We simulated diverse arboreal surfaces to test whether environmental structure had different effects on the locomotion of snakes belonging to two distantly related species with differences in axial musculature and stoutness. On most cylindrical surfaces lacking pegs, both species used concertina locomotion, which always involved periodic stopping and gripping but was kinematically distinct in the two species. On horizontal cylinders that were a small fraction of body diameter, the boa constrictors used a balancing form of lateral undulation that was not observed for rat snakes. For all snakes the presence of pegs elicited lateral undulation and enhanced speed. For both species maximal speeds decreased with increased incline and were greatest on cylinders with intermediate diameters that approximated the diameter of the snakes. The frictional resistances that we studied had small effects compared with those of cylinder diameter, incline and the presence of pegs. The stouter and more muscular boa constrictors were usually faster than the rat snakes when using the gripping gait, whereas rat snakes were faster when using lateral undulation on the surfaces with pegs. Thus, variation in environmental structure had several highly significant effects on locomotor mode, performance and kinematics that were species dependent."},{"title":"The influence of PKA treatment on the Ca2+ activation of force generation by trout cardiac muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/1989","abstract":"β-Adrenergic stimulation of the mammalian heart increases heart rate, the strength of contraction as well as the kinetics of force generation and relaxation.

Trout cTnI (ScTnI) lacks two critical PKA targets within the N-terminus of the protein that, when phosphorylated in mammalian cTnI, cause a reduction in myofilament Ca2+ affinity. To determine what role the contractile element plays in the response of the trout heart to β-adrenergic stimulation, we characterized the influence of PKA treatment on the Ca2+ activation of skinned preparations dissected from ventricular trabeculae. In these experiments, isometric force generation and the rate of force development were measured over a range of Ca2+ concentrations. The results demonstrate that PKA treatment does not influence the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation but it decreases maximum force generation by 25% and the rate of force re-development at maximal activation by 46%. Analysis of the trabeculae preparations for phosphoproteins revealed that PKA treatment phosphorylated myosin light chain 2 but not cTnI or cMyBP-C. These results indicate that the function of the trout cardiac contractile element is altered by PKA phosphorylation but in a manner different from that in mammalian heart."},{"title":"Experimentally reduced corticosterone release promotes early breeding in black-legged kittiwakes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2005","abstract":"Breeding at the right time is important for successful reproduction. In birds, stressful environmental conditions are known to delay the timing of breeding but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The stress hormone corticosterone appears to be a good candidate for mediating egg-laying date according to early environmental conditions and physiological state. By experimentally reducing the release of corticosterone in black-legged kittiwakes during the pre-laying period, we tested whether egg-laying date was mechanistically linked to corticosterone levels. Male and female kittiwakes were implanted with a low dose of exogenous corticosterone to inhibit endogenous corticosterone production. According to our predictions, the experimental reduction of corticosterone release was paralleled by a significant advancement of egg laying in females (around 4 days earlier). In addition, females with experimentally reduced corticosterone release gained mass during the pre-laying period compared with controls. Ultimately, the advancement of egg laying in females with experimentally reduced corticosterone levels was associated with an enhanced breeding success. This effect was strongly sex specific. In corticosterone-treated male kittiwakes, egg-laying date and reproductive success were not affected, but breeding probability was lower than in controls. This corticosterone treatment did not influence immediate clutch size, or return rate and breeding decision the following year. Our results support the hypothesis that corticosterone secretion during the pre-laying period mediates the timing of breeding in this long-lived seabird, possibly through the dynamics of energy reserves."},{"title":"Arctic reindeer extend their visual range into the ultraviolet","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2014","abstract":"The Arctic has extreme seasonal changes in light levels and is proportionally UV-rich because of scattering of the shorter wavelengths and their reflection from snow and ice. Here we show that the cornea and lens in Arctic reindeer do not block all UV and that the retina responds electrophysiologically to these wavelengths. Both rod and cone photoreceptors respond to UV at low-intensity stimulation. Retinal RNA extraction and in vitro opsin expression show that the response to UV is not mediated by a specific UV photoreceptor mechanism. Reindeer thus extend their visual range into the short wavelengths characteristic of the winter environment and periods of extended twilight present in spring and autumn. A specific advantage of this short-wavelength vision is the use of potential information caused by differential UV reflections known to occur in both Arctic vegetation and different types of snow. UV is normally highly damaging to the retina, resulting in photoreceptor degeneration. Because such damage appears not to occur in these animals, they may have evolved retinal mechanisms protecting against extreme UV exposure present in the daylight found in the snow-covered late winter environment."},{"title":"Some like it hot: the effects of climate change on reproduction, immune function and disease resistance in the cricket Gryllus texensis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/1997","abstract":"In many parts of the world, climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of heat waves. How do heat waves impact short-lived poikilotherms such as insects? In the cricket, Gryllus texensis, 6 days of elevated temperatures (i.e. 7°C above the average field temperature and 5°C above their preferred temperature) resulted in increased egg laying, faster egg development and greater mass gain. The increased temperature also increased activity of phenoloxidase and lysozyme-like enzymes, two immune-related enzymes, and enhanced resistance to the Gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens. When given a sublethal S. marcescens infection, G. texensis maintained increased reproductive output at the elevated temperature (33°C). These data suggest that heat waves could result in more numerous, disease resistant, crickets. However, resistance to the Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus cereus was lower at temperatures above or below the average field temperature (26°C). A sublethal infection with B. cereus reduced egg laying at all temperatures and suppressed the increase in egg laying induced by higher temperatures. These results suggest that for some species–pathogen interactions, increased temperatures can induce trade-offs between reproduction and disease resistance. This result may partly explain why G. texensis prefers temperatures lower than those that produce maximal reproductive output and enhanced immune function."},{"title":"Dolphin hearing during echolocation: evoked potential responses in an Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2027","abstract":"Auditory evoked potential (AEP) responses were recorded during echolocation in an Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) trained to accept suction-cup EEG electrodes and detect targets by echolocation. AEP recording was triggered by the echolocation clicks of the animal. Three targets with target strengths of –34, –28 and –22 dB were used at a target distance of 2 to 6.5 m for each target. The results demonstrated that the AEP appeared to both outgoing echolocation clicks and echoes during echolocation, with AEP complexes consisting of alternative positive and negative waves. The echo-related AEP amplitudes were obviously lower than the outgoing click-related AEP amplitudes for all the targets at the investigated target distances. However, for targets with target strengths of –22 and –28 dB, the peak-to-peak amplitudes of the echo-related AEPs were dependent on the target distances. The echo-related AEP response amplitudes increased at further target distances, demonstrating an overcompensation of echo attenuation with target distance in the echo-perception system of the dolphin biosonar. Measurement and analysis of outgoing click intensities showed that the click levels increased with target distance (R) by a factor of approximately 10 to 17.5 logR depending on target strength. The results demonstrated that a dual-component biosonar control system formed by intensity compensation behavior in both the transmission and receiving phases of a biosonar cycle exists synchronously in the dolphin biosonar system."},{"title":"Static electric fields modify the locomotory behaviour of cockroaches","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2020","abstract":"Static electric fields are found throughout the environment and there is growing interest in how electric fields influence insect behaviour. Here we have analysed the locomotory behaviour of cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) in response to static electric fields at levels equal to and above those found in the natural environment. Walking behaviour (including velocity, distance moved, turn angle and time spent walking) were analysed as cockroaches approached an electric field boundary in an open arena, and also when continuously exposed to an electric field. On approaching an electric field boundary, the greater the electric field strength the more likely a cockroach would be to turn away from, or be repulsed by, the electric field. Cockroaches completely exposed to electric fields showed significant changes in locomotion by covering less distance, walking slowly and turning more often. This study highlights the importance of electric fields on the normal locomotory behaviour of insects."},{"title":"Kinematics of the quadrate bone during feeding in mallard ducks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2036","abstract":"Avian cranial kinesis, in which mobility of the quadrate, pterygoid and palatine bones contribute to upper bill elevation, is believed to occur in all extant birds. The most widely accepted model for upper bill elevation is that the quadrate rotates rostrally and medially towards the pterygoid, transferring force to the mobile pterygoid–palatine complex, which pushes on the upper bill. Until now, however, it has not been possible to test this hypothesis in vivo because quadrate motions are rapid, three-dimensionally complex and not visible externally. Here we use a new in vivo X-ray motion analysis technique, X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM), to create precise (±0.06 mm) 3-D animations of the quadrate, braincase, upper bill and mandible of three mallard ducks, Anas platyrhynchos. We defined a joint coordinate system (JCS) for the quadrato-squamosal joint with the axes aligned to the anatomical planes of the skull. In this coordinate system, the quadrate's 3-D rotations produce an elliptical path of pterygoid process motion, with medial and rostrodorsal then lateral and rostrodorsal motion as the upper bill elevates. As the upper bill depresses, the pterygoid process continues along the ellipsoidal path, with lateral and caudoventral then medial and caudoventral motion. We also found that the mandibular rami bow outwards (streptognathy) during mandibular depression, which may cause the lateral component of quadrate rotation that we observed. Relative to the JCS aligned with the anatomical planes of the skull, a second JCS aligned with quadrato-squamosal joint anatomy did not produce a simpler description of quadrate kinematics."},{"title":"Circumferential spicule growth by pericellular silica deposition in the hexactinellid sponge Monorhaphis chuni","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2047","abstract":"The giant basal spicule of the hexactinellid sponge Monorhaphis chuni represents the longest natural siliceous structure on Earth. This spicule is composed of concentrically arranged lamellae that are approximately 10 μm thick. In the present study, we investigated the formation of outer lamellae on a cellular level using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. It is shown that the formation of an outermost lamella begins with the association of cell clusters with the surface of the thickening and/or growing spicule. The cells release silica for controlled formation of a lamella. The pericellular (silica) material fuses to a delimited and textured layer of silica with depressions approximately 20–30 μm in diameter. The newly formed layer initially displays 40 μm wide, well-structured banded ribbons and only attains its plain surface in a final step. The chemical composition in the depressions was studied using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and by staining with Texas Red. The data suggest that those depressions are the nests for the silica-forming cells and that silica formation starts with a direct association of silica-forming cells with the outer surface of the spicule, where they remain and initiate the development of the next lamellae."},{"title":"The ontogeny of regulatory control of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) heart and how this is influenced by chronic hypoxia exposure","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2065","abstract":"Salmonid embryos develop in cool waters over relatively long periods of time. Interestingly, hypoxic conditions have been found to be relatively common in some nesting sites (redds). The goals of this study were to determine the ontogeny of cardiac regulation in rainbow trout early life stages and how this is influenced by chronic hypoxia. The heart rate response to cholinergic and adrenergic receptor stimulation or inhibition was measured in individuals reared in normoxic (100% O2 saturation) or hypoxic (30% O2 saturation) conditions from fertilization to embryonic stages 22, 26 and 29, and larval stages 30 and 32. In normoxia, heart rate increased in response to β-adrenergic receptor stimulation (isoproterenol) as early as embryonic stage 22, and decreased with the antagonist propranolol after this stage. Cholinergic stimulation (acetylcholine) was ineffective at all stages, but atropine (acetylcholine antagonist) increased heart rate at larval stage 32. This demonstrates that cardiac β-adrenergic receptors are functional at early life stages, while cholinergic receptors are not responsive until after hatching. Collectively, embryos had cardio-acceleration control mechanisms in place just after the heartbeat stage, while cardio-inhibitory control was not functional until after hatching. Chronic hypoxia exposure triggered bradycardia, increased the response to adrenergic stimulation in embryos and larvae, and delayed the onset of cholinergic control in larvae. In non-motile stages, therefore, survival in chronic low oxygen may depend on the ability to alter the cardiac ontogenic program to meet the physiological requirements of the developing fish."},{"title":"Kinematic and behavioral evidence for a distinction between trotting and ambling gaits in the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2057","abstract":"Earlier observations had suggested that cockroaches might show multiple patterns of leg coordination, or gaits, but these were not followed by detailed behavioral or kinematic measurements that would allow a definite conclusion. We measured the walking speeds of cockroaches exploring a large arena and found that the body movements tended to cluster at one of two preferred speeds, either very slow (<10 cm s–1) or fairly fast (∼30 cm s–1). To highlight the neural control of walking leg movements, we experimentally reduced the mechanical coupling among the various legs by tethering the animals and allowing them to walk in place on a lightly oiled glass plate. Under these conditions, the rate of stepping was bimodal, clustering at fast and slow speeds. We next used high-speed videos to extract three-dimensional limb and joint kinematics for each segment of all six legs. The angular excursions and three-dimensional motions of the leg joints over the course of a stride were variable, but had different distributions in each gait. The change in gait occurs at a Froude number of ∼0.4, a speed scale at which a wide variety of animals show a transition between walking and trotting. We conclude that cockroaches do have multiple gaits, with corresponding implications for the collection and interpretation of data on the neural control of locomotion."},{"title":"Loading effects on jump performance in green anole lizards, Anolis carolinensis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2073","abstract":"Locomotor performance is a crucial determinant of organismal fitness but is often impaired in certain circumstances, such as increased mass (loading) resulting from feeding or gravidity. Although the effects of loading have been studied extensively for striding locomotion, its effects on jumping are poorly understood. Jumping is a mode of locomotion that is widely used across animal taxa. It demands large amounts of power over a short time interval and, consequently, may be affected by loading to a greater extent than other modes of locomotion. We placed artificial loads equal to 30% body mass on individuals of the species Anolis carolinensis to simulate the mass gain following the consumption of a large meal. We investigated the effects of loading on jump performance (maximum jump distance and accuracy), kinematics and power output. Loading caused a significant 18% decline in maximum jump distance and a significant 10% decline in takeoff speed. In other words, the presence of the load caused the lizards to take shorter and slower jumps, whereas takeoff angle and takeoff duration were not affected. By contrast, jump accuracy was unaffected by loading, although accuracy declined when lizards jumped to farther perches. Finally, mass-specific power output did not increase significantly when lizards jumped with loads, suggesting that the ability to produce mechanical power may be a key limiting factor for maximum jump performance. Our results suggest that mass gain after a large meal can pose a significant locomotor challenge and also imply a tradeoff between fulfilling energy requirement and moving efficiently in the environment."},{"title":"The effect of acclimation to hypoxia and sustained exercise on subsequent hypoxia tolerance and swimming performance in goldfish (Carassius auratus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2080","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine whether acclimation to hypoxia and sustained exercise would increase hypoxia tolerance (as indicated by a decrease in critical oxygen tension, Pcrit) and swimming performance in goldfish (Carassius auratus), and to investigate the relationship between changes in performance and gill remodelling and tissue metabolic capacity. Goldfish were acclimated to either hypoxia (48 h at 0.3 mg O2 l–1) or sustained exercise (48 h at 70% of critical swimming speed, Ucrit) and then Pcrit and Ucrit were determined in normoxia (10 mg O2 l–1) and hypoxia (1 mg O2 l–1) and compared with values from control fish. Acclimation to both hypoxia and sustained exercise improved hypoxia tolerance (Pcrit was reduced by 49% and 39%, respectively), which was associated with an increase in lamellar surface area (71% and 43%, respectively) and an increase in blood [Hb] (26% in both groups).

While hypoxia acclimation resulted in an increase in Ucrit in normoxia, acclimation to sustained exercise did not improve subsequent swimming performance in normoxia.

Although there is no definitive explanation for why an optimal stride frequency exists, elastic energy usage has been implicated. Because the possibility for elastic energy storage and return may be impaired on slopes, we investigated whether and how the optimal stride frequency changes during uphill and downhill running. Presuming a smaller role of elastic energy, we hypothesized that altering stride frequency would change metabolic cost less during uphill and downhill running than during level running. To test this hypothesis, we collected force and metabolic data as nine male subjects ran at 2.8 m s–1 on the level, 3 deg uphill and 3 deg downhill. Stride frequency was systematically varied above and below preferred stride frequency (PSF ±8% and ±15%). Ground reaction force data were used to calculate potential, kinetic and total mechanical energy, and to calculate the theoretical maximum possible and estimated actual elastic energy storage and return. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that neither the overall relationship between metabolic cost and stride frequency nor the energetically optimal stride frequency changed substantially with slope. However, estimated actual elastic energy storage as a percentage of total positive power increased with increasing stride frequency on all slopes, indicating that muscle power decreases with increasing stride frequency. Combined with the increased cost of force production and internal work with increasing stride frequency, this leads to an intermediate optimal stride frequency and overall U-shaped curve."},{"title":"Involvement of redox- and phosphorylation-dependent pathways in osmotic adaptation in sperm cells of euryhaline tilapia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2096","abstract":"Sperm cells involved in fertilisation must tolerate hypo-osmotic and hyper-osmotic environments. Euryhaline tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) can acclimatise to and reproduce in freshwater and seawater because its sperm are able to adapt to these differing osmotic environments. In this study, we found that the dephosphorylation of sperm proteins in O. mossambicus correlated with the activation of flagellar motility when sperm were exposed to hypotonic or hypertonic conditions, and that differences in phosphorylation may reflect adaptations to a given osmotic environment. Of the sperm proteins that were dephosphorylated, the phosphorylation pattern of an 18 kDa protein, identified as the superoxide anion scavenger Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), was different in freshwater- and seawater-acclimatised tilapia sperm. Cu/Zn SOD was distributed from the sperm head to the flagellum. Additionally, differences were observed between freshwater and seawater tilapia in the nitration of tyrosine residues (which might be mediated by SOD) in sperm flagellar proteins in response to osmotic shock. These results demonstrate that reactive-oxygen-species-dependent mechanisms contribute to both osmotic tolerance and the activation of flagellar motility."},{"title":"Sound radiation and wing mechanics in stridulating field crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2105","abstract":"Male field crickets emit pure-tone mating calls by rubbing their wings together. Acoustic radiation is produced by rapid oscillations of the wings, as the right wing (RW), bearing a file, is swept across the plectrum borne on the left wing (LW). Earlier work found the natural resonant frequency (fo) of individual wings to be different, but there is no consensus on the origin of these differences. Previous studies suggested that the frequency along the song pulse is controlled independently by each wing. It has also been argued that the stridulatory file has a variable fo and that the frequency modulation observed in most species is associated with this variability. To test these two hypotheses, a method was developed for the non-contact measurement of wing vibrations during singing in actively stridulating Gryllus bimaculatus. Using focal microinjection of the neuroactivator eserine into the cricket's brain to elicit stridulation and micro-scanning laser Doppler vibrometry, we monitored wing vibration in actively singing insects. The results show significantly lower fo in LWs compared with RWs, with the LW fo being identical to the sound carrier frequency (N=44). But during stridulation, the two wings resonate at one identical frequency, the song carrier frequency, with the LW dominating in amplitude response. These measurements also demonstrate that the stridulatory file is a constant resonator, as no variation was observed in fo along the file during sound radiation. Our findings show that, as they engage in stridulation, cricket wings work as coupled oscillators that together control the mechanical oscillations generating the remarkably pure species-specific song."},{"title":"Low external environmental calcium levels prevent forgetting in Lymnaea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/12/2118","abstract":"Forgetting may allow an animal to react more appropriately to current conditions, rather than continuing to exhibit a previously learned, possibly maladaptive behaviour based on previous experience. One theory is that forgetting is an active process, whereby the previously learnt response is replaced by new learning that interferes with the older memory. Hence, we hypothesized that an appropriately timed environmental stressor that blocks long-term memory (LTM) formation would also block forgetting. Lymnaea stagnalis (L.) is a freshwater snail, which requires environmental calcium of at least 20 mg l–1 to meet its requirements. Low environmental Ca2+ (i.e. 20 mg l–1) in their environment acts as a stressor, and prevents LTM formation. Here, we asked whether a low Ca2+ environment would also prevent forgetting, concordant with the retrograde interference model of Jenkins and Dallenbach. Snails were operantly conditioned to reduce aerial respiration in hypoxia. When maintained in standard conditions (80 mg l–1 Ca2+), snails demonstrated LTM following training lasting 24 h, but not 72 h; however, when trained in standard conditions then exposed to a low Ca2+ environment (20 mg l–1) immediately following training, they retained memory for at least 96 h, indicating that forgetting had been blocked. Thus, when exposed to low environmental Ca2+, Lymnaea will fail to form new memories, but will also continue to retain information previously learned and remembered as the low calcium blocks forgetting."},{"title":"Origins of variation in muscle cytochrome c oxidase activity within and between fish species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1888","abstract":"Mitochondrial content, central to aerobic metabolism, is thought to be controlled by a few transcriptional master regulators, including nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), NRF-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Though well studied in mammals, the mechanisms by which these factors control mitochondrial content have been less studied in lower vertebrates. We evaluated the role of these transcriptional regulators in seasonal changes in white muscle cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity in eight local fish species representing five families: Centrarchidae, Umbridae, Esocidae, Gasterosteidae and Cyprinidae. Amongst centrarchids, COX activity was significantly higher in winter for pumpkinseed (2-fold) and black crappie (1.3-fold) but not bluegill or largemouth bass. In esociforms, winter COX activity was significantly higher in central mudminnow (3.5-fold) but not northern pike. COX activity was significantly higher in winter-acclimatized brook stickleback (2-fold) and northern redbelly dace (3-fold). Though mudminnow COX activity increased in winter, lab acclimation to winter temperatures did not alter COX activity, suggesting a role for non-thermal cues. When mRNA was measured for putative master regulators of mitochondria, there was little evidence for a uniform relationship between COX activity and any of NRF-1, NRF-2α or PGC-1α mRNA levels Collectively, these studies argue against a simple temperature-dependent mitochondrial response ubiquitous in fish, and suggest that pathways which control mitochondrial content in fish may differ in important ways from those of the better studied mammals."},{"title":"Fibroblasts from long-lived bird species are resistant to multiple forms of stress","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1902","abstract":"Evolutionary senescence theory postulates that aging results from the declining force of natural selection with increasing chronological age. A goal of comparative studies in the biology of aging is to identify genetic and biochemical mechanism(s) driving species-specific differences in the aging process that are the end product of life history trade-offs. We hypothesized that cells from long-lived bird species are more resistant to stress agents than are cells from short-lived species, and that cells from birds are more resistant to stress than are cells from relatively short-lived mammals of similar size. We tested primary fibroblast cultures from 35 species of free-living birds for their resistance to multiple forms of cellular stress and found that cell lines from longer-lived species were resistant to death caused by cadmium (R2=0.27, P=0.002), paraquat (R2=0.13, P=0.03), hydrogen peroxide (R2=0.09, P=0.07) and methyl methanesulfonate (R2=0.13, P=0.03), as well as to the metabolic inhibition seen in low-glucose medium (R2=0.37, P<0.01). They did not differ in their resistance to UV radiation, or to thapsigargin or tunicamycin, inducers of the unfolded protein response. These results were largely consistent even after accounting for the influence of body mass and phylogeny. Cell lines from longer-lived bird species also proliferate more rapidly than cells from short-lived birds, although there was no relationship between proliferation and stress resistance. Finally, avian fibroblasts were significantly more resistant than rodent fibroblasts to each of the tested stressors. These results support the idea that cellular resistance to injury may be an important contributor to the evolution of slow aging and long lifespan among bird species, and may contribute to the relatively long lifespan of birds compared with rodents of the same body size."},{"title":"What causes wing wear in foraging bumble bees?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1896","abstract":"Flying is an ecologically important behaviour in many insects, but it often results in permanent wing damage. Although wing wear in insects is often used as a method to determine insect age, and is associated with an increased risk of mortality, the causes of wing wear are unresolved. In this paper, we examine whether wing use while foraging explains wing wear in bumble bees (Bombus spp.). Wing wear may result from three distinct flight characteristics during foraging: time spent in flight, flight frequency and frequency of wing collisions with vegetation. To test these hypotheses for causes of wing wear, we recorded digital video of individually marked bumble bees foraging in nature on 12 different plant species that result in variation in these flight characteristics, and recaptured these individuals to photograph their wings over time. Bumble bees with a higher frequency of wing collisions showed an increased loss of wing area, which became more severe over time. Neither time in flight nor flight frequency was uniquely and significantly associated with wing wear. Therefore, the collision frequency hypothesis best explained wing wear in bumble bees. We conclude that wing use during foraging in bumble bees results in wing wear. Wing wear reflects behaviour, not simply age. Because wing wear has elsewhere been shown to increase mortality, this study provides an important mechanism linking foraging behaviour with lifespan."},{"title":"A numerical study of the effects of bell pulsation dynamics and oral arms on the exchange currents generated by the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1911","abstract":"Mathematical and experimental studies of the flows generated by jellyfish have focused primarily on mechanisms of swimming. More recent work has also considered the fluid dynamics of feeding from currents generated during swimming. Here we capitalize on the benthic lifestyle of the upside-down jellyfish (Cassiopea xamachana) to explore the fluid dynamics of feeding uncoupled from swimming. A two-dimensional mathematical model is developed to capture the fundamental characteristics of the motion of the unique concave bell shape. Given the prominence of the oral arms, this structure is included and modeled as a porous layer that perturbs the flow generated by bell contractions. The immersed boundary method is used to solve the fluid–structure interaction problem. Velocity fields obtained from live organisms using digital particle image velocimetry were used to validate the numerical simulations. Parameter sweeps were used to numerically explore the effects of changes in pulse dynamics and the properties of the oral arms independently. Numerical experiments allow the opportunity to examine physical effects and limits within and beyond the biologically relevant range to develop a better understanding of the system. The presence of the prominent oral arm structures in the field of flow increased the flux of new fluid from along the substrate to the bell. The numerical simulations also showed that the presence of pauses between bell expansion and the next contraction alters the flow of the fluid over the bell and through the oral arms."},{"title":"Hydrodynamic discrimination of wakes caused by objects of different size or shape in a harbour seal (Phoca vitulina)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1922","abstract":"Harbour seals can use their mystacial vibrissae to detect and track hydrodynamic wakes. We investigated the ability of a harbour seal to discriminate objects of different size or shape by their hydrodynamic signature and used particle image velocimetry to identify the hydrodynamic parameters that a seal may be using to do so. Hydrodynamic trails were generated by different sized or shaped paddles that were moved in the calm water of an experimental box to produce a characteristic signal. In a two-alternative forced-choice procedure the blindfolded subject was able to discriminate size differences of down to 3.6 cm (Weber fraction 0.6) when paddles were moved at the same speed. Furthermore the subject distinguished hydrodynamic signals generated by flat, cylindrical, triangular or undulated paddles of the same width. Particle image velocimetry measurements demonstrated that the seal could have used the highest velocities and the steepness of the gradients within the wake to discriminate object size, beside the size of counter-rotating vortices and the spatial extension of a wake. For shape discrimination the subject could have used the spatial extension of the whole wake, in addition to the arrangement of the vortices. We tested whether the seal used highest velocities, the steepness of the gradients and the spatial extension of the wake in a second set of experiments by varying moving speed and paddle size, respectively. The subject was still able to discriminate between the respective object sizes, but the minimum detectable size difference increased to 4.4 cm (Weber fraction 3.6). For the shape discrimination task, the seal was only able to distinguish flat from triangular paddles. Our results indicate that the seal's discrimination abilities depend on more than one hydrodynamic parameter."},{"title":"Seasonal plasticity of auditory hair cell frequency sensitivity correlates with plasma steroid levels in vocal fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1931","abstract":"Vertebrates displaying seasonal shifts in reproductive behavior provide the opportunity to investigate bidirectional plasticity in sensory function. The midshipman teleost fish exhibits steroid-dependent plasticity in frequency encoding by eighth nerve auditory afferents. In this study, evoked potentials were recorded in vivo from the saccule, the main auditory division of the inner ear of most teleosts, to test the hypothesis that males and females exhibit seasonal changes in hair cell physiology in relation to seasonal changes in plasma levels of steroids. Thresholds across the predominant frequency range of natural vocalizations were significantly less in both sexes in reproductive compared with non-reproductive conditions, with differences greatest at frequencies corresponding to call upper harmonics. A subset of non-reproductive males exhibiting an intermediate saccular phenotype had elevated testosterone levels, supporting the hypothesis that rising steroid levels induce non-reproductive to reproductive transitions in saccular physiology. We propose that elevated levels of steroids act via long-term (days to weeks) signaling pathways to upregulate ion channel expression generating higher resonant frequencies characteristic of non-mammalian auditory hair cells, thereby lowering acoustic thresholds."},{"title":"Mechanisms underlying rhythmic locomotion: dynamics of muscle activation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1955","abstract":"We have studied the dynamical properties of tension development in leech longitudinal muscle during swimming. A new method is proposed for modeling muscle properties under functionally relevant conditions where the muscle is subjected to both periodic activation and rhythmic length changes. The ‘dual-sinusoid’ experiments were conducted on preparations of leech nerve cord and body wall. The longitudinal muscle was activated periodically by injection of sinusoidal currents into an identified motoneuron. Simultaneously, sinusoidal length changes were imposed on the body wall with prescribed phase differences (12 values equally spaced over 2π radians) with respect to the current injection. Through the singular value decomposition of appropriately constructed tension data matrices, the leech muscle was found to have a multiplicative structure in which the tension was expressed as the product of activation and length factors. The time courses of activation and length factors were determined from the tension data and were used to develop component models. The proposed modeling method is a general one and is applicable to contractile elements for which the effects of series elasticity are negligible."},{"title":"The distribution and expression of CFTR restricts electrogenic anion secretion to the ileum of the brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1943","abstract":"In eutherian mammals, fluid secretion is essential for intestinal function. This is driven by electrogenic Cl– secretion, which involves a NaK2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) in the enterocyte basolateral membrane and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the apical membrane. However, in the possum ileum, NKCC1 expression is low and secretagogues stimulate electrogenic HCO3– secretion driven by a basolateral NaHCO3 cotransporter (pNBCe1). Here we investigated whether electrogenic anion secretion occurs in possum duodenum and jejunum and determined the role of CFTR in possum intestinal anion secretion. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and forskolin stimulated a large increase in ileal short-circuit current (Isc), consistent with electrogenic HCO3– secretion, but had little effect on the duodenal and jejunal Isc. Furthermore, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) and N-(2-naphthalenyl)-[(3,5-dibromo-2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)methylene]glycine hydrazide (GlyH101) inhibited cloned possum CFTR in cultured cells and the PGE2-stimulated ileal Isc, implicating CFTR in ileal HCO3– secretion. Consistent with this, CFTR is expressed in the apical membrane of ileal crypt and lower villous cells, which also express pNBCe1 in the basolateral membrane. In contrast, duodenal and jejunal CFTR expression is low relative to the ileum. Jejunal pNBCe1 expression is also low, whereas duodenal and ileal pNBCe1 expression are comparable. All regions have low NKCC1 expression. These results indicate that cAMP-dependent electrogenic Cl– secretion does not occur in the possum small intestine because of the absence of CFTR and NKCC1. Furthermore, CFTR functions as the apical anion conductance associated with HCO3– secretion and its distribution limits electrogenic HCO3– secretion to the ileum."},{"title":"Striped marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) tadpoles do not acclimate metabolic performance to thermal variability","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1965","abstract":"Human-induced climate change is predicted to affect not only the mean temperature of the environment but also the variability and frequency of extreme climatic events. Variability in an organism's developmental environment has the potential to markedly affect an individual's growth trajectory and physiological function, leading to impacts on individual fitness and population dynamics. Thus, it is important to consider the consequences of thermal variability on developing organisms and understand their capacity to respond to such increased variation. We investigated the capacity of larval striped marsh frogs (Limnodynastes peronii) to initiate a response to increases in the thermal variability of their developmental environment by reducing the sensitivity of their physiological rate functions to changes in temperature. In variable environments, we expected the thermal sensitivity of rate functions to decrease and their performance breadth to widen so as to buffer the effect of thermal variability. We raised larvae in stable (24°C), narrowly variable (22–26°C; mean 24°C) and widely variable (14–34°C; mean 24°C) thermal environments and measured the thermal sensitivity of their locomotor performance, heart rate, oxygen consumption and activities of two metabolic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase. We found that the temperature-dependent relationships of these physiological functions did not differ between tadpoles raised in stable or variable thermal conditions. Furthermore, the Q10 values of each response variable were virtually unaffected by treatment when measured over the entire thermal range. Our results reveal that larval amphibians exhibit little plasticity in metabolic traits to thermal variability. This lack of plasticity may have important implications for the growth and population dynamics of organisms in environments that are beginning to experience increased thermal variability."},{"title":"Temperature-dependent modification of muscle precursor cell behaviour is an underlying reason for lasting effects on muscle cellularity and body growth of teleost fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1791","abstract":"Temperature is an important factor influencing teleost muscle growth, including a lasting (‘imprinted’) influence of embryonic thermal experience throughout all further life.

Fish were reared at three different temperatures (8.5, 13 and 16°C) until hatching and subsequently kept under the same (ambient) thermal conditions.

The results demonstrate that at hatching, body lengths, fast and slow muscle cross-sectional areas and fast fibre numbers are lower in fish reared at 8.5 and 13°C than at 16°C. During the larval period, this situation changes in the 13°C-fish, so that these fish are finally the largest. The observed effects can be related to divergent cellular mechanisms at the MPC level that are initiated in the embryo during the imprinting period. Embryos of 16°C-fish have reduced MPC proliferation but increased differentiation, and thus give rise to larger hatchlings. However, their limited MPC reserves finally lead to smaller adults. By contrast, embryos of 13°C-fish and, to a lesser extent, 8.5°-fish, show enhanced MPC proliferation but reduced differentiation, thus leading to smaller hatchlings but allowing for a larger MPC pool that can be used for enhanced post-hatching growth, finally resulting in larger adults."},{"title":"Post-prandial changes in protein synthesis in red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) larvae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1821","abstract":"Protein synthesis is one of the major energy-consuming processes in all living organisms. Post-prandial changes in protein synthesis have been studied in a range of animal taxa but have been little studied in fish larvae. Using the flooding-dose method, we measured post-prandial changes in whole-body rates of protein synthesis in regularly fed red drum Sciaenops ocellatus (Linnaeus) larvae for 24–28 h following their daily meal. Fractional rates of protein synthesis increased from a baseline (pre-feeding) rate of 16% day–1 to a post-prandial peak of 48% day–1 ca. 8 h after feeding before declining to 12% day–1 after 24–28 h. The overall mean daily rate of protein synthesis was calculated as 27% day–1. Although suggested as energetically impossible in larval poikilotherms, our results show that rates in excess of 30% day–1 can be attained by larval fishes for a few hours but are not sustained. The average daily energetic cost of protein synthesis was estimated as 34% of daily total oxygen consumption, ranging from 19% immediately before feeding to 61% during the post-prandial peak in protein synthesis. This suggests that during the post-prandial peak, protein synthesis will require a large proportion of the hourly energy production, which, given the limited metabolic scope in fish larvae, may limit the energy that could otherwise be allocated to other energy-costly functions, such as foraging and escape responses."},{"title":"What triggers the aerobic dive limit? Patterns of muscle oxygen depletion during dives of emperor penguins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1802","abstract":"The physiological basis of the aerobic dive limit (ADL), the dive duration associated with the onset of post-dive blood lactate elevation, is hypothesized to be depletion of the muscle oxygen (O2) store. A dual wavelength near-infrared spectrophotometer was developed and used to measure myoglobin (Mb) O2 saturation levels in the locomotory muscle during dives of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri). Two distinct patterns of muscle O2 depletion were observed. Type A dives had a monotonic decline, and, in dives near the ADL, the muscle O2 store was almost completely depleted. This pattern of Mb desaturation was consistent with lack of muscle blood flow and supports the hypothesis that the onset of post-dive blood lactate accumulation is secondary to muscle O2 depletion during dives. The mean type A Mb desaturation rate allowed for calculation of a mean muscle O2 consumption of 12.4 ml O2 kg–1 muscle min–1, based on a Mb concentration of 6.4 g 100 g–1 muscle. Type B desaturation patterns demonstrated a more gradual decline, often reaching a mid-dive plateau in Mb desaturation. This mid-dive plateau suggests maintenance of some muscle perfusion during these dives. At the end of type B dives, Mb desaturation rate increased and, in dives beyond the ADL, Mb saturation often reached near 0%. Thus, although different physiological strategies may be used during emperor penguin diving, both Mb desaturation patterns support the hypothesis that the onset of post-dive lactate accumulation is secondary to muscle O2 store depletion."},{"title":"Minimum daily core body temperature in western grey kangaroos decreases as summer advances: a seasonal pattern, or a direct response to water, heat or energy supply?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1813","abstract":"Using implanted temperature loggers, we measured core body temperature in nine western grey kangaroos every 5 min for 24 to 98 days in spring and summer. Body temperature was highest at night and decreased rapidly early in the morning, reaching a nadir at 10:00 h, after ambient temperature and solar radiation had begun to increase. On hotter days, the minimum morning body temperature was lower than on cooler days, decreasing from a mean of 36.2°C in the spring to 34.0°C in the summer. This effect correlated better with the time of the year than with proximate thermal stressors, suggesting that either season itself or some factor correlated with season, such as food availability, caused the change. Water saving has been proposed as a selective advantage of heterothermy in other large mammals, but in kangaroos the water savings would have been small and not required in a reserve with permanent standing water. We calculate that the lower core temperature could provide energy savings of nearly 7%. It is likely that the heterothermy that we observed on hot days results either from decreased energy intake during the dry season or from a seasonal pattern entrained in the kangaroos that presumably has been selected for because of decreased energy availability during the dry season."},{"title":"The hydrodynamic disturbances of two species of krill: implications for aggregation structure","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1845","abstract":"Krill aggregations vary in size, krill density and uniformity depending on the species of krill. These aggregations may be structured to allow individuals to sense the hydrodynamic cues of neighboring krill or to avoid the flow fields of neighboring krill, which may increase drag forces on an individual krill. To determine the strength and location of the flow disturbance generated by krill, we used infrared particle image velocimetry measurements to analyze the flow field of free-swimming solitary specimens (Euphausia superba and Euphausia pacifica) and small, coordinated groups of three to six E. superba. Euphausia pacifica individuals possessed shorter body lengths, steeper body orientations relative to horizontal, slower swimming speeds and faster pleopod beat frequencies compared with E. superba. The downward-directed flow produced by E. pacifica has a smaller maximum velocity and smaller horizontal extent of the flow pattern compared with the flow produced by E. superba, which suggests that the flow disturbance is less persistent as a potential hydrodynamic cue for E. pacifica. Time record analysis reveals that the hydrodynamic disturbance is very weak beyond two body lengths for E. pacifica, whereas the hydrodynamic disturbance is observable above background level at four body lengths for E. superba. Because the nearest neighbor separation distance of E. superba within a school is less than two body lengths, hydrodynamic disturbances are a viable cue for intraspecies communication. The orientation of the position of the nearest neighbor is not coincident with the orientation of the flow disturbance, however, which indicates that E. superba are avoiding the region of strongest flow."},{"title":"Differential muscular myosin heavy chain expression of the pectoral and pelvic girdles during early growth in the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) chick","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1829","abstract":"Continuous growth, associated with a steady parental food supply, is a general pattern in offspring development. So that young chicks can acquire their locomotor independence, this period is usually marked by a fast maturation of muscles, during which different myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms are expressed. However, parental food provisioning may fluctuate seasonally, and offspring therefore face a challenge to ensure the necessary maturation of their tissues when energy is limited. To address this trade-off we investigated muscle maturation in both the pectoral and pelvic girdles of king penguin chicks. This species has an exceptionally long rearing period (1 year), which is prolonged when parental food provisioning is drastically reduced during the sub-Antarctic winter. Approximately 1 month post hatching, chicks acquire a functional pedestrian locomotion, which uses pelvic muscles, whereas swimming, which uses the pectoral muscles, only occurs 1 year later. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the MyHC content of the leg muscles reaches a mature state before those of the pectoral muscles. We found that leg muscle MyHC composition changed with the progressive acquisition of pedestrian locomotion, whereas pectoral muscle fibres reached their mature MyHC profile as early as hatching. Contrary to our predictions, the acquisition of the adult profile in pectoral muscles could be related to an early maturation of the contractile muscular proteins, presumably associated with early thermoregulatory capacities of chicks, necessary for survival in their cold environment. This differential maturation appears to reconcile both the locomotor and environmental constraints of king penguin chicks during growth."},{"title":"Proteomic response to elevated PCO2 level in eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica: evidence for oxidative stress","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1836","abstract":"Estuaries are characterized by extreme fluctuations in CO2 levels due to bouts of CO2 production by the resident biota that exceed its capacity of CO2 consumption and/or the rates of gas exchange with the atmosphere and open ocean waters. Elevated partial pressures of CO2 (PCO2; i.e. environmental hypercapnia) decrease the pH of estuarine waters and, ultimately, extracellular and intracellular pH levels of estuarine organisms such as mollusks that have limited capacity for pH regulation. We analyzed proteomic changes associated with exposure to elevated PCO2 in the mantle tissue of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) after 2 weeks of exposure to control (∼39 Pa PCO2) and hypercapnic (∼357 Pa PCO2) conditions using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry. Exposure to high PCO2 resulted in a significant proteome shift in the mantle tissue, with 12% of proteins (54 out of 456) differentially expressed under the high PCO2 compared with control conditions. Of the 54 differentially expressed proteins, we were able to identify 17. Among the identified proteins, two main functional categories were upregulated in response to hypercapnia: those associated with the cytoskeleton (e.g. several actin isoforms) and those associated with oxidative stress (e.g. superoxide dismutase and several peroxiredoxins as well as the thioredoxin-related nucleoredoxin). This indicates that exposure to high PCO2 (∼357 Pa) induces oxidative stress and suggests that the cytoskeleton is a major target of oxidative stress. We discuss how elevated CO2 levels may cause oxidative stress by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) either indirectly by lowering organismal pH, which may enhance the Fenton reaction, and/or directly by CO2 interacting with other ROS to form more free radicals. Although estuarine species are already exposed to higher and more variable levels of CO2 than other marine species, climate change may further increase the extremes and thereby cause greater levels of oxidative stress."},{"title":"Aerodynamics of tip-reversal upstroke in a revolving pigeon wing","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1867","abstract":"During slow flight, bird species vary in their upstroke kinematics using either a ‘flexed wing’ or a distally supinated ‘tip-reversal’ upstroke. Two hypotheses have been presented concerning the function of the tip-reversal upstroke. The first is that this behavior is aerodynamically inactive and serves to minimize drag. The second is that the tip-reversal upstroke is capable of producing significant aerodynamic forces. Here, we explored the aerodynamic capabilities of the tip-reversal upstroke using a well-established propeller method. Rock dove (Columba livia, N=3) wings were spread and dried in postures characteristic of either mid-upstroke or mid-downstroke and spun at in vivo Reynolds numbers to simulate forces experienced during slow flight. We compared 3D wing shape for the propeller and in vivo kinematics, and found reasonable kinematic agreement between methods (mean differences 6.4% of wing length). We found that the wing in the upstroke posture is capable of producing substantial aerodynamic forces. At in vivo angles of attack (66 deg at mid-upstroke, 46 deg at mid-downstroke), the upstroke wings averaged for three birds produced a lift-to-drag ratio of 0.91, and the downstroke wings produced a lift-to-drag ratio of 3.33. Peak lift-to-drag ratio was 2.5 for upstroke and 6.3 for downstroke. Our estimates of total force production during each half-stroke suggest that downstroke produces a force that supports 115% of bodyweight, and during upstroke a forward-directed force (thrust) is produced at 36% of body weight."},{"title":"Tarantulas cling to smooth vertical surfaces by secreting silk from their feet","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1874","abstract":"Like all spiders, tarantulas (family Theraphosidae) synthesize silk in specialized glands and extrude it from spinnerets on their abdomen. In one species of large tarantula, Aphonopelma seemanni, it has been suggested that silk can also be secreted from the tarsi but this claim was later refuted. We provide evidence of silk secretion directly from spigots (nozzles) on the tarsi of three distantly related tarantula species: the Chilean rose, Grammostola rosea; the Indian ornamental, Poecilotheria regalis; and the Mexican flame knee, Brachypelma auratum, suggesting tarsal silk secretion is widespread among tarantulas. We demonstrate that multiple strands of silk are produced as a footprint when the spider begins to slip down a smooth vertical surface. The nozzle-like setae on the tarsi responsible for silk deposition have shanks reinforced by cuticular thickenings, which serve to prevent the shanks' internal collapse while still maintaining their flexibility. This is important as the spigots occur on the ventral surface of the tarsus, projecting beyond the finely divided setae of the dry attachment pads. We also reveal the structure and disposition of the silk-secreting spigots on the abdominal spinnerets of the three tarantula species and find they are very similar to those from the earliest known proto-spider spinneret from the Devonian period, giving another indication that silk secretion in tarantulas is close to the ancestral condition."},{"title":"A hydrodynamic sensory antenna used by killifish for nocturnal hunting","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1857","abstract":"The perception of sensory stimuli by an animal requires several steps, commencing with the capture of stimulus energy by an antenna that, as the interface between the physical world and the nervous system, modifies the stimulus in ways that enhance the animal's perception. The mammalian external ear, for example, collects sound and spectrally alters it to increase sensitivity and improve the detection of directionality. In view of the morphological diversity of the lateral-line system across species and its accessibility to observation and experimental intervention, we sought to investigate the role of antennal structures on the response characteristics of the lateral line. The surface-feeding killifish Aplocheilus lineatus is able to hunt in darkness by detecting surface capillary waves with the lateral-line system atop its head. This cephalic lateral line consists of a stereotyped array of 18 mechanosensitive neuromasts bordered by fleshy ridges. By recording microphonic potentials, we found that each neuromast has a unique receptive field defined by its sensitivity to stimulation of the water's surface. The ridges help determine these receptive fields by altering the flow of water over each neuromast. Modification of the hydrodynamic environment by the addition of a supplemental ridge changes the pattern of water movement, perturbs the receptive fields of adjacent neuromasts and impairs the fish's localization ability. On the basis of electrophysiological, hydrodynamic and behavioral evidence, we propose that the ridges constitute a hydrodynamic antenna for the cephalic lateral line."},{"title":"Coordination of cytochrome c oxidase gene expression in the remodelling of skeletal muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/11/1880","abstract":"Many fish species respond to low temperature by inducing mitochondrial biogenesis, reflected in an increase in activity of the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (COX). COX is composed of 13 subunits, three encoded by mitochondrial (mt)DNA and 10 encoded by nuclear genes. We used real-time PCR to measure mRNA levels for the 10 nuclear-encoded genes that are highly expressed in muscle. We measured mRNA levels in white muscle of three minnow species, each at two temperatures: zebrafish (Danio rerio) acclimated to 11 and 30°C, goldfish (Carassius auratus) acclimated to 4 and 35°C, and northern redbelly dace (Chrosomus eos) collected in winter and summer. We hypothesized that temperature-induced changes in COX activity would be paralleled by COX nuclear-encoded subunit transcript abundance. However, we found mRNA for COX subunits showed pronounced differences in thermal responses. Though zebrafish COX activity did not change in the cold, the transcript levels of four subunits decreased significantly (COX5A1, 60% decrease; COX6A2, 70% decrease; COX6C, 50% decrease; COX7B, 55% decrease). Treatments induced changes in COX activity in both dace (2.9 times in winter fish) and goldfish (2.5 times in cold fish), but the response in transcript levels was highly variable. Some subunits failed to increase in one (goldfish COX7A2, dace COX6A2) or both (COX7B, COX6B2) species. Other transcripts increased 1.7–100 times. The most cold-responsive subunits were COX4-1 (7 and 21.3 times higher in dace and goldfish, respectively), COX5A1 (13.9 and 5 times higher), COX6B1 (6 and 10 times higher), COX6C (11 and 4 times higher) and COX7C (13.3 and 100 times higher). The subunits that most closely paralleled COX increases in the cold were COX5B2 (dace 2.5 times, goldfish 1.7 times) and COX6A2 (dace 4.1 times, goldfish 1.7 times). Collectively, these studies suggest that COX gene expression is not tightly coordinated during cold-induced mitochondrial remodelling in fish muscle. Further, they caution against arguments about the importance of transcriptional regulation based on measurement of mRNA levels of select subunits of multimeric proteins."},{"title":"Oxidative profile varies with personality in European greenfinches","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1732","abstract":"Where behavioural responses differ consistently between individuals, this is termed ‘personality’. There is the suggestion, but with little supporting data, that personality traits reflect underlying variation in physiology. Here, we tested whether greenfinches Carduelis chloris differing in personality traits differed in various plasma indices of oxidative profile: antioxidant capacity (OXY), pro-oxidant status (reactive oxygen metabolites, ROMs), oxidative stress (OS) and an end-product of oxidative damage: malondialdehyde (MDA). We measured two personality traits: neophobia (latency to approach food near novel objects) and object exploration (latency to approach novel objects). These traits were uncorrelated. ROMs, OXY, OS and MDA were also uncorrelated with each other. Highly neophobic birds had lower OXY, higher ROMs and higher OS than less neophobic birds. Fast exploring birds had higher OXY than slow explorers, but did not differ in ROMs or OS. Variation in MDA was described by a quadratic relationship with neophobia: birds with extremely high or low neophobia had lower MDA than birds with intermediate neophobia, despite highly neophobic birds exhibiting lower OS than intermediately neophobic birds. Additively in that model, fast explorers had lower MDA than slower explorers. To conclude: first, personality types can differ in oxidative profile. Second, although physiological differences (e.g. hormonal stress responsiveness) between personality types generally range along a linear continuum, physiological costs may not. Finally, relationships with oxidative profile differed between neophobia and object exploration. Understanding how oxidative profile and thus physiological costs vary within and between personality traits may explain how differences in personality traits can predict fitness."},{"title":"Experimental evolution of sperm count in protandrous self-fertilizing hermaphrodites","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1740","abstract":"Sperm count evolution is driven by sexual selection, with an added role of selection on gamete resource allocation for hermaphrodite spermatogenesis. However, self-fertilization by hermaphrodites retards sexual selection and results in the evolution of reduced investment in sperm or pollen. In contrast to reproduction limited by female gametes (Bateman's Principle), self-fertilizing Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites exhibit sperm-limited reproduction. Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites are thought to experience a fitness trade-off between lifetime fecundity and generation time: longer sperm production decreases the risk of self-sperm depletion, but at the same time delays the onset of selfing and thus increases egg-to-egg generation time. Theory predicts that shorter larval development will favor lower sperm counts and longer development will favor more sperm. To investigate how developmental trajectories affect the evolution of sperm production, we performed experimental evolution by directly competing alleles controlling hermaphrodite sperm count, conducted under different environmental conditions that alter development time. Results are partially consistent with theory: rapid larval development generally favored alleles encoding production of few sperm. However, we identify some previously unrecognized simplifications of the theory and its application to our experimental system. In addition, we evaluated the generality of sperm limitation in C. elegans. Although optimal growth conditions yield sperm limitation, non-optimal conditions induce oocyte limitation, suggesting that this species might conform to Bateman's Principle under many natural settings. These findings demonstrate how developmental trajectories can shape the fitness landscape for the evolution of reproduction and sperm traits, even without sexual selection."},{"title":"ATP distribution and localization of mitochondria in Suberites domuncula (Olivi 1792) tissue","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1748","abstract":"The metabolic energy state of sponge tissue in vivo is largely unknown. Quantitative bioluminescence-based imaging was used to analyze the ATP distribution of Suberites domuncula (Olivi 1792) tissue, in relation to differences between the cortex and the medulla. This method provides a quantitative picture of the ATP distribution closely reflecting the in vivo situation. The obtained data suggest that the highest ATP content occurs around channels in the sponge medulla. HPLC reverse-phase C-18, used for measurement of ATP content, established a value of 1.62 μmol ATP g–1 dry mass in sponge medulla, as opposed to 0.04 μmol ATP g–1 dry mass in the cortex, thus indicating a specific and defined energy distribution. These results correlate with the mitochondria localization, determined using primary antibodies against cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (COX1) (immunostaining), as well as with the distribution of arginine kinase (AK), essential for cellular energy metabolism (in situ hybridization with AK from S. domuncula; SDAK), in sponge sections. The highest energy consumption seemed to occur in choanocytes, the cells that drive the water through the channel system of the sponge body. Taken together, these results showed that the majority of energetic metabolism in S. domuncula occurs in the medulla, in the proximity of aqueous channels."},{"title":"Effects of fore–aft body mass distribution on acceleration in dogs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1763","abstract":"The ability of a quadruped to apply propulsive ground reaction forces (GRF) during rapid acceleration may be limited by muscle power, foot traction or the ability to counteract the nose-up pitching moment due to acceleration. Because the biomechanics of acceleration change, both throughout the stride cycle and over subsequent strides as velocity increases, the factors limiting propulsive force production may also change. Depending on which factors are limiting during each step, alterations in fore–aft body mass distribution may either increase or decrease the maximum propulsive GRF produced. We analyzed the effects of experimental alterations in the fore–aft body mass distribution of dogs as they performed rapid accelerations. We measured the changes in trunk kinematics and GRF as dogs accelerated while carrying 10% body mass in saddlebags positioned just in front of the shoulder girdle or directly over the pelvic girdle. We found that dogs applied greater propulsive forces in the initial hindlimb push-off and first step by the lead forelimb in both weighted conditions. During these steps dogs appear to have been limited by foot traction. For the trailing forelimb, propulsive forces and impulses were reduced when dogs wore caudally placed weights and increased when dogs wore cranially placed weights. This is consistent with nose-up pitching or avoidance thereof having limited propulsive force production by the trailing forelimb. By the second stride, the hindlimbs appear to have been limited by muscle power in their ability to apply propulsive force. Adding weights decreased the propulsive force they applied most in the beginning of stance, when limb retractor muscles were active in supporting body weight. These results suggest that all three factors: foot traction, pitching of the body, and muscle power play roles in limiting quadrupedal acceleration. Digging in to the substrate with claws or hooves appears to be necessary for maximizing propulsion in the initial hindlimb push-off and first forelimb step. Shifting the center of mass forward, as occurred with the loss of the large and heavy tail in the evolution of mammals, is likely to increase the contribution of the forelimbs to acceleration. Hindlimb muscle power appears to play a greater role in limiting acceleration than does forelimb muscle power. As such, we might expect animals built for rapid acceleration to have an increased ratio of hindlimb to forelimb muscle mass."},{"title":"High background noise shapes selective auditory filters in a tropical cricket","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1754","abstract":"Because of call frequency overlap and masking interference, the airborne sound channel represents a limited resource for communication in a species-rich cricket community like the tropical rainforest. Here we studied the frequency tuning of an auditory neuron mediating phonotaxis in the rainforest cricket Paroecanthus podagrosus, suffering from strong competition, in comparison with the same homologous neuron in two species of European field crickets, where such competition does not exist. As predicted, the rainforest species exhibited a more selective tuning compared with the European counterparts. The filter reduced background nocturnal noise levels by 26 dB, compared with only 16 and 10 dB in the two European species. We also quantified the performance of the sensory filter under the different filter regimes by examining the representation of the species-specific amplitude modulation of the male calling song, when embedded in background noise. Again, the filter of the rainforest cricket performed significantly better in terms of representing this important signal parameter. The neuronal representation of the calling song pattern within receivers was maintained for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios because of the more sharply tuned sensory system and selective attention mechanisms. Finally, the rainforest cricket also showed an almost perfect match between the filter for sensitivity and the peripheral filter for directional hearing, in contrast to its European counterparts. We discuss the consequences of these adaptations for intraspecific acoustic communication and reproductive isolation between species."},{"title":"Histaminergic signaling in the central nervous system of Daphnia and a role for it in the control of phototactic behavior","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1773","abstract":"Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex are well-established model organisms in the fields of ecotoxicology and toxicogenomics. Among the many assays used for determining the effects of environmental and anthropogenic stressors on these animals is monitoring for changes in their phototactic behavior. In most arthropods, histamine has been shown to play a key role in the visual system. Currently, nothing is known about histaminergic signaling in either D. magna or D. pulex. Here, a combination of immunohistochemistry and genome mining was used to identify and characterize the histaminergic systems in these daphnids. In addition, a behavioral assay was used to assess the role of histamine in their phototactic response to ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. An extensive network of histaminergic somata, axons and neuropil was identified via immunohistochemistry within the central nervous system of both daphnids, including labeling of putative photoreceptors in the compound eye and projections from these cells to the brain. Mining of the D. pulex genome using known Drosophila melanogaster proteins identified a putative ortholog of histidine decarboxylase (the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme for histamine), as well as two putative histamine-gated chloride channels (hclA and hclB orthologs). Exposure of D. magna to cimetidine, an H2 receptor antagonist known to block both hclA and hclB in D. melanogaster, inhibited their negative phototactic response to UV exposure in a reversible, time-dependent manner. Taken collectively, our results show that an extensive histaminergic system is present in Daphnia species, including the visual system, and that this amine is involved in the control of phototaxis in these animals."},{"title":"Molecular physiology and functional morphology of SO42– excretion by the kidney of seawater-adapted eels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1783","abstract":"Marine teleosts actively excrete SO42– and keep the plasma concentration of this ion much lower than that of environmental seawater (SW). We used the eel as a model to study the excretory mechanism of SO42– because this euryhaline species changes SO42– regulation drastically after transfer from freshwater (FW) to SW. Time-course studies showed that plasma SO42– concentration decreased 3 days after transfer of eels from FW to SW, while urine SO42– concentration increased on 1 day. Detailed analyses showed that urine SO42– concentration increased linearly from 6 h after SW transfer; however, this did not immediately translate to increased SO42– excretion because the volume of urine was decreased. We identified five SO42– transporters in the eel kidney. Three of these (Slc26a1, Slc26a6b and Slc26a6c) are expressed in both SW- and FW-acclimated eels while Slc26a6a and Slc13a1 are expressed in SW-acclimated eels and FW-acclimated eels, respectively. We showed that changes in Slc26a6a and Slc13a1 gene expression occurred 1–3 days after SW transfer. In SW eel kidneys, immunohistochemistry using specific antisera against each transporter protein showed that Slc26a6a and Slc26a6c are localized on the apical membrane of the P1 segment of the proximal tubule, while Slc26a6b is localized on the apical membrane and Slc26a1 on the basolateral membrane of the P2 segment. The current study revealed complex molecular mechanisms of SO42– excretion in the SW eel kidney that involve segment-specific localization of multiple Slc transporters in proximal tubules and modulation of their expression in different SO42– environments. This precise regulatory mechanism may endow the eel with euryhalinity."},{"title":"Bottles as models: predicting the effects of varying swimming speed and morphology on size selectivity and filtering efficiency in fishes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1643","abstract":"We created physical models based on the morphology of ram suspension-feeding fishes to better understand the roles morphology and swimming speed play in particle retention, size selectivity and filtration efficiency during feeding events. We varied the buccal length, flow speed and architecture of the gills slits, including the number, size, orientation and pore size/permeability, in our models. Models were placed in a recirculating flow tank with slightly negatively buoyant plankton-like particles (∼20–2000 μm) collected at the simulated esophagus and gill rakers to locate the highest density of particle accumulation. Particles were captured through sieve filtration, direct interception and inertial impaction. Changing the number of gill slits resulted in a change in the filtration mechanism of particles from a bimodal filter, with very small (≤50 μm) and very large (>1000 μm) particles collected, to a filter that captured medium-sized particles (101–1000 μm). The number of particles collected on the gill rakers increased with flow speed and skewed the size distribution towards smaller particles (51–500 μm). Small pore sizes (105 and 200 μm mesh size) had the highest filtration efficiencies, presumably because sieve filtration played a significant role. We used our model to make predictions about the filtering capacity and efficiency of neonatal whale sharks. These results suggest that the filtration mechanics of suspension feeding are closely linked to an animal's swimming speed and the structural design of the buccal cavity and gill slits."},{"title":"Repeatability of standard metabolic rate, active metabolic rate and aerobic scope in young brown trout during a period of moderate food availability","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1668","abstract":"Standard metabolic rate (SMR) and active metabolic rate (AMR) are two fundamental physiological parameters providing the floor and ceiling in aerobic energy metabolism.

In this study we tested the temporal repeatability of individual SMR, AMR and AAS, as well as repeatability of body mass, in young brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) fed a moderately restricted diet (0.5–0.7% fish mass day–1).

Individual body mass was highly repeatable across the entire 15 week experimental period whereas residual body-mass-corrected SMR, AMR and AAS showed a gradual loss of repeatability over time. Individual residual SMR, AMR and AAS were significantly repeatable in the short term (5 weeks), gradually declined across the medium term (10 weeks) and completely disappeared in the long term (15 weeks). We suggest that this gradual decline in repeatability was due to the slightly restricted feeding regime.

Because musculoskeletal growth of the feeding system facilitates high bite-force generation necessary to overcome the physical constraints of consuming more durable prey, durophagous taxa are well suited for investigations of the scaling relationships between musculoskeletal growth, bite-force generation and dietary ontogeny. To elucidate which biomechanical factors are responsible for allometric changes in bite force and durophagy, we developed and experimentally tested a static model of bite-force generation throughout development in the durophagous turtle Sternotherus minor. Moreover, we quantified the fracture properties of snails found in the diet to evaluate the relationship between bite force and the forces required to process durable prey. We found that (1) the static bite-force model accurately predicts the ontogenetic scaling of bite forces, (2) bite-force positive allometry is accomplished by augmenting muscle size and muscle pennation, and (3) the rupture forces of snails found in the diet show a similar scaling pattern to bite force across ontogeny. These results indicate the importance of muscle pennation for generating high bite forces while maintaining muscle size and provide empirical evidence that the allometric patterns of musculoskeletal growth in S. minor are strongly linked to the structural properties of their primary prey."},{"title":"How muscles define maximum running performance in lizards: an analysis using swing- and stance-phase muscles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1685","abstract":"Maximum locomotor performance is crucial for capturing prey, escaping predators and many other behaviors. However, we know little about what defines maximum performance in vertebrates. Muscles drive the movement of the limbs during locomotion, and thus likely play a major role in defining locomotor capacity. For lizards, the iliofibularis, a swing-phase muscle, is often linked to ecology and/or performance. However, stance-phase muscles likely limit performance given that they propel the animal. Using a small semi-arboreal lizard (Sceloporus woodi), we compared how swing- and stance-phase muscles relate to maximum running speed and acceleration. We employed both a level and vertical trackway to elicit ecologically relevant locomotor performance. Six individuals were filmed at 250 frames s–1 in lateral view. Following performance trials, upper and lower hindlimbs were sectioned and assessed using histochemistry. Fast glycolytic, fast oxidative and slow oxidative fibers were detected and counted in the gastrocnemius (GA; stance phase) and iliofibularis (IF; swing phase) muscles. In addition, the mean fiber diameter for each fiber type in each muscle was determined, as was the fiber cross-sectional area. We found that properties of the GA, but not the IF, were positively correlated with performance. Interestingly, certain attributes of the GA were correlated with maximum vertical locomotion whereas others were correlated with maximum level locomotion. We conclude that stance phase, not swing phase, limits maximum performance in this species of lizard. In addition, we highlight the need to include properties of stance-phase muscles and a spectrum of ecologically relevant behaviors when attempting to correlate locomotor physiology with ecology and/or performance."},{"title":"Activity of the claw retractor muscle in stick insects in wall and ceiling situations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1676","abstract":"The activity of the middle part of the claw retractor muscle was examined in two species of stick insects (Carausius morosus and Cuniculina impigra). We performed electromyographic recordings while the animals were standing on a smooth or a rough surface of a platform in horizontal, vertical or inverted positions, as well as during rotations of the platform. We recorded tonic and phasic motor units. The tonic units were active all the time without significant differences in spike frequency, regardless of the position of the animals (although there was a tendency for higher discharge frequencies to occur during platform rotations). The phasic units were active almost exclusively during platform movement. In contrast to the tonic units, we detected significant differences in the activities of the phasic units; namely, higher spike frequencies during rotations compared with the stationary phases, especially for rotations into ‘more awkward’ positions. A comparison of the two species revealed no difference in muscle activity, despite differences in the animals' tarsal attachment structures. The same was true when comparing the muscle activity of the two species on both the smooth and the rough surfaces."},{"title":"The contractile sponge epithelium sensu lato – body contraction of the demosponge Tethya wilhelma is mediated by the pinacoderm","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1692","abstract":"Sponges constitute one of the two metazoan phyla that are able to contract their bodies despite a complete lack of muscle cells. Two competing hypotheses on the mechanisms behind this have been postulated to date: (1) mesohyl-mediated contraction originating from fusiform smooth muscle-like actinocytes (‘myocytes’) and (2) epidermal contraction originating in pinacocytes. No direct support exists for either hypothesis. The question of agonist–antagonist interaction in sponge contraction seems to have been completely neglected so far. In the present study we addressed this by studying sponge contraction kinetics. We also tested both hypotheses by carrying out volumetric studies of 3D synchrotron radiation-based x-ray microtomography data obtained from contracted and expanded specimens of Tethya wilhelma. Our results support the pinacoderm contraction hypothesis. Should mesohyl contraction be present, it is likely to be part of the antagonist system. We conclude that epithelial contraction plays a major role in sponges. Contractile epithelia sensu lato may be regarded as part of the ground pattern of the Metazoa."},{"title":"Cross-linking by protein oxidation in the rapidly setting gel-based glues of slugs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1699","abstract":"The terrestrial slug Arion subfuscus secretes a glue that is a dilute gel with remarkable adhesive and cohesive strength. The function of this glue depends on metals, raising the possibility that metal-catalyzed oxidation plays a role. The extent and time course of protein oxidation was measured by immunoblotting to detect the resulting carbonyl groups. Several proteins, particularly one with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 165×103, were heavily oxidized. Of the proteins known to distinguish the glue from non-adhesive mucus, only specific size variants were oxidized. The oxidation appears to occur within the first few seconds of secretion. Although carbonyls were detected by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in denatured proteins, they were not easily detected in the native state. The presence of reversible cross-links derived from carbonyls was tested for by treatment with sodium borohydride, which would reduce uncross-linked carbonyls to alcohols, but stabilize imine bonds formed by carbonyls and thus lead to less soluble complexes. Consistent with imine bond formation, sodium borohydride led to a 20–35% decrease in the amount of soluble protein with a Mr of 40–165 (×103) without changing the carbonyl content per protein. In contrast, the nucleophile hydroxylamine, which would competitively disrupt imine bonds, increased protein solubility in the glue. Finally, the primary amine groups on a protein with a Mr of 15×103 were not accessible to acid anhydrides. The results suggest that cross-links between aldehydes and primary amines contribute to the cohesive strength of the glue."},{"title":"Social interactions influence dopamine and octopamine homeostasis in the brain of the ant Formica japonica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1707","abstract":"In ants, including Formica japonica, trophallaxis and grooming are typical social behaviors shared among nestmates. After depriving ants of either food or nestmates and then providing them with either food or nestmates, a behavioral change in type and frequency of social interactions was observed. We hypothesized that starvation and isolation affected levels of brain biogenic amines including dopamine (DA) and octopamine (OA) – neuromediators modifying various insect behaviors – and tested the relationship between brain biogenic amines and social behaviors of stressed ants. Ants starved for 7 days contained lower brain DA levels and they did not perform trophallaxis toward nestmates. Feeding starved ants sucrose solution re-established trophallaxis but not brain DA levels. The performance of trophallaxis induced recovery of brain DA content to the level of untreated ants. Ants that were isolated for 2 days displayed markedly increased OA levels, which following nestmate interactions, returned to levels similar to those of control (non-isolated) ants and ants isolated for 1 h. We conclude that: (1) starvation reduced brain DA level but had no significant effect on brain OA (trophallaxis recovered the brain DA levels), and (2) isolation increased brain OA level but had no effect on brain DA (trophallaxis and grooming events recovered the brain OA levels). We suggest that social interactions with nestmates influenced brain biogenic amine homeostasis in stressed F. japonica."},{"title":"Chronic social stress impairs thermal tolerance in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1721","abstract":"When faced with limited resources, juvenile salmonid fish form dominance hierarchies that result in social stress for socially subordinate individuals. Social stress, in turn, can have consequences for the ability of the fish to respond to additional stressors such as pathogens or exposure to pollutants. In the present study, the possibility that social stress affects the ability of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to tolerate acute increases in water temperature was investigated. To this end, we first evaluated physiological and cellular stress responses following a 1 h heat shock in juvenile fish in dominance hierarchies. We measured stress hormone (cortisol and catecholamines) concentrations and blood, brain and liver tissue levels of three heat shock proteins (HSPs), the stress inducible HSP70, the constitutive HSC70 and HSP90, in dominant and subordinate trout. No effects of social status on the hormonal response to the heat stress were detected, but the cellular heat shock response in the brain and liver of dominant and subordinate individuals was inhibited. We then assessed thermal tolerance in dominant and subordinate fish through critical thermal maximum temperature (CTmax) trials and measured HSPs following the heat shock. Subordinate fish were less thermally tolerant than their dominant counterparts. We conclude that social stress impacts the ability of fish to respond, on a cellular scale and in a tissue-specific manner, to increases in water temperature, with likely consequences for overall fitness."},{"title":"Mechanisms of pH control in the midgut of Lutzomyia longipalpis: roles for ingested molecules and hormones","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1411","abstract":"Control of the midgut pH in Lutzomyia longipalpis enables the insect's digestive system to deal with different types of diet. Phlebotomines must be able to suddenly change from a condition adequate to process a sugar diet to one required to digest blood. Prior to blood ingestion, the pH in the midgut is maintained at ∼6 via an efficient mechanism. In the abdominal midgut, alkalization to a pH of ∼8 occurs as a consequence of the loss of CO2 from blood (CO2 volatilization) and by a second mechanism that is not yet characterized. The present study aimed to characterize the primary stimuli, present in the blood, that are responsible for shutting down the mechanism that maintains a pH of 6 and switching on that responsible for alkalization. Our results show that any ingested protein could induce alkalization. Free amino acids, at the concentrations found in blood, were ineffective at inducing alkalization, although higher concentrations of amino acids were able to induce alkalization. Aqueous extracts of midgut tissue containing putative hormones from intestinal endocrine cells slightly alkalized the midgut lumen when applied to dissected intestines, as did hemolymph collected from blood-fed females. Serotonin, a hormone that is possibly released in the hemolymph after hematophagy commences, was ineffective at promoting alkalization. The carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme seems to be involved in alkalizing the midgut, as co-ingestion of acetazolamide (a CA inhibitor) with proteins impaired alkalization efficiency. A general model of alkalization control is presented."},{"title":"Effects of oxygen availability on maximum aerobic performance in Mus musculus selected for basal metabolic rate or aerobic capacity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/10/1714","abstract":"Maximum aerobic metabolism cannot increase indefinitely in response to demands for ATP production and, therefore, must be constrained by one (or many) of the steps of the oxygen transport and utilization pathways.

We studied the ontogeny of responses of Drosophila melanogaster adult body size to hypoxic exposure. We hypothesized that there may be critical oxygen-sensitive periods during D. melanogaster development that are primarily responsive to body size regulation. Instead, our results showed that exposure to hypoxia (an atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen of 10 kPa) during any developmental stage (embryo, larvae and pupae) leads to smaller adult size. However, short hypoxic exposures during the late larval and early pupal stages had the greatest effects on adult size. We then investigated whether the observed reductions in size induced by hypoxia at various developmental stages were the result of a decrease in cell size or cell number. Abdominal epithelial cells of flies reared continuously in hypoxia were smaller in mean diameter and were size-limited compared with cells of flies reared in normoxia. Flies reared in hypoxia during the embryonic, larval or pupal stage, or during their entire development, had smaller wing areas than flies reared in normoxia. Flies reared during the pupal stage, or throughout development in hypoxia had smaller wing cells, even after controlling for the effect of wing size. These results suggest that hypoxia effects on the body size of D. melanogaster probably occur by multiple mechanisms operating at various developmental stages."},{"title":"Benefits associated with escalated begging behaviour of black-billed magpie nestlings overcompensate the associated energetic costs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1463","abstract":"Several experimental results support the existence of costs associated with exaggerated begging behaviour, which are assumed by some theoretical models of honest signalling in parent–offspring communication. However, to understand how honest begging behaviour is evolutionarily maintained in nature, the long-term cost–benefit output associated with exaggerated signals should also be estimated. As far as we know, the net cost–benefit balance of begging display has not previously been explored. Here, we used an appetite stimulant, cyproheptadine hydrochloride, to increase the feeling of hunger in some magpie nestlings. Supporting the use of cyproheptadine to manipulate hunger level and thereby begging behaviour, we found that experimental nestlings increased the frequency of begging and received more food than their control nestmates. Contrary to the expectation that physiological costs per se counteract the associated benefits of escalated begging signals, we found that near-fledging experimental magpies showed a better physical condition than control nestlings. These findings stress the interesting question of why magpie nestlings do not show to adults an escalated level of hunger if it implies an advantage. We discuss the responsibility of inclusive fitness costs and indirect genetic effects for the maintenance of honesty in parent–offspring communication."},{"title":"Rainbow trout consume less oxygen in turbulence: the energetics of swimming behaviors at different speeds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1428","abstract":"Measuring the rate of consumption of oxygen (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/214/9/1428/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>) during swimming reveals the energetics of fish locomotion. We show that rainbow trout have substantially different oxygen requirements for station holding depending on which hydrodynamic microhabitats they choose to occupy around a cylinder. We used intermittent flow respirometry to show that an energetics hierarchy, whereby certain behaviors are more energetically costly than others, exists both across behaviors at a fixed flow velocity and across speeds for a single behavior. At 3.5 L s–1 (L is total body length) entraining has the lowest <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/214/9/1428/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/>, followed by Kármán gaiting, bow waking and then free stream swimming.

The molecular components of this change are largely unknown, but tight junctions that regulate the paracellular pathway are prime candidates in this adaptational process. Using differential display polymerase chain reaction we found a set of 17 differentially regulated genes in trout pavement cells that had been exposed to freshwater apically for 24 h. Five genes were related to the cell–cell contact. One of these genes was isolated and identified as encoding claudin 28b, an integral component of the tight junction. Immunohistochemical reactivity to claudin 28b protein was concentrated in a circumferential ring colocalized to the cortical F-actin ring. To study the contribution of this isoform to changes in transepithelial resistance and Phenol Red diffusion under apical hypo-or hyperosmotic exposure we quantified the fluorescence signal of this claudin isoform in immunohistochemical stainings together with the fluorescence of phalloidin-probed F-actin. Upon hypo-osmotic stress claudin 28b fluorescence and epithelial tightness remained stable. Under hyperosmotic stress, the presence of claudin 28b at the junction significantly decreased, and epithelial tightness was severely reduced. Cortical F-actin fluorescence increased upon hypo-osmotic stress, whereas hyperosmotic stress led to a separation of cortical F-actin rings and the number of apical crypt-like pores increased. Addition of cortisol to the basolateral medium attenuated cortical F-actin separation and pore formation during hyperosmotic stress and reduced claudin 28b in junctions except after recovery of cells from exposure to freshwater. Our results showed that short-term salinity stress response in cultured trout gill cells was dependent on a dynamic remodeling of tight junctions, which involves claudin 28b and the supporting F-actin ring."},{"title":"Insulin-like peptide genes in honey bee fat body respond differently to manipulation of social behavioral physiology","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1488","abstract":"Nutrient sensitive insulin-like peptides (ILPs) have profound effects on invertebrate metabolism, nutrient storage, fertility and aging. Many insects transcribe ILPs in specialized neurosecretory cells at changing levels correlated with life history. However, the major site of insect metabolism and nutrient storage is not the brain, but rather the fat body, where functions of ILP expression are rarely studied and poorly understood. Fat body is analogous to mammalian liver and adipose tissue, with nutrient stores that often correlate with behavior. We used the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an insect with complex behavior, to test whether ILP genes in fat body respond to experimentally induced changes of behavioral physiology. Honey bee fat body influences endocrine state and behavior by secreting the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin (Vg), which suppresses lipophilic juvenile hormone and social foraging behavior. In a two-factorial experiment, we used RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated vg gene knockdown and amino acid nutrient enrichment of hemolymph (blood) to perturb this regulatory module. We document factor-specific changes in fat body ilp1 and ilp2 mRNA, the bee's ILP-encoding genes, and confirm that our protocol affects social behavior. We show that ilp1 and ilp2 are regulated independently and differently and diverge in their specific expression-localization between fat body oenocyte and trophocyte cells. Insect ilp functions may be better understood by broadening research to account for expression in fat body and not only brain."},{"title":"Getting ahead: context-dependent responses to odorant filaments drive along-stream progress during odor tracking in blue crabs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1498","abstract":"The chemosensory signal structure governing the upstream progress of blue crabs to an odorant source was examined. We used a three-dimensional laser-induced fluorescence system to collect chemical concentration data simultaneously with behavior observations of actively tracking blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) in a variety of plume types. This allowed us to directly link chemical signal properties at the antennules and legs to subsequent upstream motion while altering the spatial and temporal intermittency characteristics of the sensory field. Our results suggest that odorant stimuli elicit responses in a binary fashion by causing upstream motion, provided the concentration at the antennules exceeds a specific threshold. In particular, we observed a significant association between crab velocity changes and odorant spike encounters defined using a threshold that is scaled to the mean of the instantaneous maximum concentration. Thresholds were different for each crab, indicating a context-sensitive response to signal dynamics. Our data also indicate that high frequency of odorant spike encounters terminate upstream movement. Further, the data provide evidence that the previous state of the crab and prior stimulus history influence the behavioral response (i.e. the response is context dependent). Two examples are: (1) crabs receiving prior odorant spikes attained elevated velocity more quickly in response to subsequent spikes; and (2) prior acceleration or deceleration of the crab influenced the response time period to a particular odorant spike. Finally, information from both leg and antennule chemosensors interact, suggesting parallel processing of odorant spike properties during navigation."},{"title":"Physiology of invasion: cane toads are constrained by thermal effects on physiological mechanisms that support locomotor performance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1437","abstract":"Understanding the mechanisms that constrain the invasiveness of introduced animals is essential for managing invasions and for predicting their limits. In most vertebrate species, the capacity for invasion relies upon the physiological systems that support locomotion, and oxygen transport and metabolism may become limiting as environmental temperatures increase as predicted by the oxygen limitation hypothesis. Here we test the oxygen limitation hypothesis and propose the alternative hypothesis that within-individual plasticity will compensate for thermal variation. We show that during exercise in the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) oxygen transport by the cardiovascular system was maximised in warm-acclimated toads at high (30°C) temperatures, and that oxygen content of arterial blood was not affected by temperature. Resting oxygen consumption remained stable across a 10°C temperature range (20–30°C) when toads were allowed to acclimate, so that there was no increase in resting oxygen demand that could lead to a decrease in aerobic scope at high temperatures. Additionally, temperature acclimation had no effect on arterial–venous differences in oxygen partial pressures. Toads relied more on glycolytic ATP production at low temperatures to support locomotor activity. Mitochondrial capacities (citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase activities) were greatest at warmer temperatures. Interestingly, the metabolic cost of exercise increased at low temperatures. In contradiction to predictions by the oxygen limitation hypothesis, aerobic performance was not limited by high temperatures. On the contrary, the relatively slow advance of cane toads to cooler climates can be explained by the constraints of low temperatures on the physiological systems supporting locomotion. It is likely that human-induced global warming will facilitate invasions of environments that are currently too cool to support cane toads."},{"title":"In vivo and in vitro assessment of cardiac β-adrenergic receptors in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1445","abstract":"β-Adrenergic receptors (βARs) are crucial for maintaining the rate and force of cardiac muscle contraction in vertebrates.

Zebrafish larvae lacking β1AR expression by morpholino knockdown displayed lower heart rates than control fish, whereas larvae deficient in both β2aAR and β2bAR expression exhibited significantly higher heart rates than controls. These results suggested a potential inhibitory role for one or both β2AR genes. By using cultured HEK293 cells transfected with zebrafish βARs, we demonstrated that stimulation with adrenaline or procaterol (a β2AR agonist) resulted in an increase in intracellular cAMP levels in cells expressing any of the three zebrafish βARs. In comparison with its human βAR counterpart, zebrafish β2aAR expressed in HEK293 cells appeared to exhibit a unique binding affinity profile for adrenergic ligands. Specifically, zebrafish β2aAR had a high binding affinity for phenylephrine, a classical α-adrenergic receptor agonist. The zebrafish receptors also had distinct ligand binding affinities for adrenergic agonists when compared with human βARs in culture, with zebrafish β2aAR being distinct from human β2AR and zebrafish β2bAR. Overall, this study provides insight into the function and evolution of both fish and mammalian β-adrenergic receptors."},{"title":"Temperature-dependent regulation of blood distribution in snakes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1458","abstract":"Regional control of blood flow is often suggested as a mechanism for fine thermoregulatory adjustments in snakes.

We injected snakes with\n99mTc-MAA at cold (6–8°C) and hot (27–32°C) temperatures and imaged them using a gamma scanner. At cold ambient temperatures, snakes significantly reduced the blood flow to their tails and significantly increased the blood flow to their heads. Conversely, at hot ambient temperatures, snakes significantly increased the blood flow to their tails and significantly reduced the blood flow to their heads. This confirms that snakes are able to use differential blood distribution to regulate temperature. Our images confirm that snakes use regional control of blood flow as a means of thermoregulation and that vasomotor control of vascular beds is likely to be the mechanism of control."},{"title":"Staying the course: chemical signal spatial properties and concentration mediate cross-stream motion in turbulent plumes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1513","abstract":"This study examined the role of broadly distributed sensor populations in chemosensory searching, especially cross-stream heading adjustment. We used three-dimensional laser-induced fluorescence to collect chemical concentration data simultaneously with behavior observations of actively tracking blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus). Our analysis indicates that the spatial distribution of the odorant concentration field is necessary and sufficient to mediate correct cross-stream motion, although concentration provides information that supplements that obtained from the spatial distribution. Crab movement is continually adjusted to maintain an upstream heading, with corrections toward the source modulated only in the presence of chemical cues. Crabs detect and respond to shifts in the position of the center-of-mass (COM) of the odorant concentration distribution as small as 5% of the leg span, which corresponds to ∼0.8–0.9 cm. The reaction time after a 5% threshold shift in the position of the COM is in the range of 2–4 s. Data also indicate that these steering responses are dependent on stimulus history or other characteristics of the plume, with crabs taking longer to respond in conditions with large-scale spatial meanders. Although cross-stream motion is determined by chemical signal inputs to receptors on the walking legs, crabs do make rotational movements in response to chemical signals impinging on the antennules. These rotational movements do not affect the direction of travel, but rather, determine the crab's body angle with respect to the flow. Interestingly, these body angles seem to represent a compromise between reducing drag and obtaining better chemical signal information, and this trade-off is resolved differently under different plume conditions."},{"title":"Body weight-dependent troponin T alternative splicing is evolutionarily conserved from insects to mammals and is partially impaired in skeletal muscle of obese rats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1523","abstract":"Do animals know at a physiological level how much they weigh, and, if so, do they make homeostatic adjustments in response to changes in body weight? Skeletal muscle is a likely tissue for such plasticity, as weight-bearing muscles receive mechanical feedback regarding body weight and consume ATP in order to generate forces sufficient to counteract gravity. Using rats, we examined how variation in body weight affected alternative splicing of fast skeletal muscle troponin T (Tnnt3), a component of the thin filament that regulates the actin–myosin interaction during contraction and modulates force output. In response to normal growth and experimental body weight increases, alternative splicing of Tnnt3 in rat gastrocnemius muscle was adjusted in a quantitative fashion. The response depended on weight per se, as externally attached loads had the same effect as an equal change in actual body weight. Examining the association between Tnnt3 alternative splicing and ATP consumption rate, we found that the Tnnt3 splice form profile had a significant association with nocturnal energy expenditure, independently of effects of weight. For a subset of the Tnnt3 splice forms, obese Zucker rats failed to make the same adjustments; that is, they did not show the same relationship between body weight and the relative abundance of five Tnnt3 β splice forms (i.e. Tnnt3 β2–β5 and β8), four of which showed significant effects on nocturnal energy expenditure in Sprague–Dawley rats. Heavier obese Zucker rats displayed certain splice form relative abundances (e.g. Tnnt3 β3) characteristic of much lighter, lean animals, resulting in a mismatch between body weight and muscle molecular composition. Consequently, we suggest that body weight-inappropriate skeletal muscle Tnnt3 expression in obesity is a candidate mechanism for muscle weakness and reduced mobility. Weight-dependent quantitative variation in Tnnt3 alternative splicing appears to be an evolutionarily conserved feature of skeletal muscle and provides a quantitative molecular marker to track how an animal perceives and responds to body weight."},{"title":"The shallow turn of a worm","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1554","abstract":"When crawling on a solid surface, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) moves forward by propagating sinusoidal dorso-ventral retrograde contraction waves. A uniform propagating wave leads to motion that undulates about a straight line. When C. elegans turns as it forages or navigates its environment, it uses several different strategies of reorientation. These modes include the well-known omega turn, in which the worm makes a sharp angle turn forming an Ω-shape, and the reversal, in which the worm draws itself backwards. In these two modes of reorientation, C. elegans strongly disrupts its propagating sinusoidal wave, either in form or in direction, leading to abrupt directional change. However, a third mode of reorientation, the shallow turn, involves a gentler disruption of the locomotory gait. Analyzing the statistics of locomotion suggests that the shallow turn is by far the most frequent reorienting maneuver in navigation in the absence of food. We show that the worm executes a shallow turn by modulating the amplitude and wavelength of its curvature during forward movement, and provide a minimal description of the process using a three-parameter mathematical model. The results of our study augment the understanding of how these parameters are controlled at the neuromotor circuit level."},{"title":"Physiological responses of the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis to bacterial stress from Vibrio coralliilyticus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1533","abstract":"As the effects of climate change have become increasingly visible over the past three decades, coral reefs have suffered from a number of natural and anthropogenic disturbances that have caused a critical decline in coral populations. Among these disturbances are coral diseases, which have appeared with increasing frequency and severity, often in correlation with increases in water temperature. Although the crucial role played by Vibrio species in coral disease has been widely documented, the scientific community does not yet fully understand the infection process of Vibrio or its impact on coral physiology and immunology. Here, we investigated the physiological and transcriptomic responses of a major reef-building coral, Pocillopora damicornis, when exposed to a specific pathogen (Vibrio coralliilyticus) under virulent (increasing water temperature) and non-virulent (constant low temperature) conditions. The infection process was examined by electron microscopy and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, and coral health was monitored by visual observations and measurements of zooxanthellar density. The results obtained suggest that coral tissue invasion occurs upon increasing water temperature only. Transcriptomic variations were investigated using a suppression–subtractive–hybridization approach, and the expression levels of six candidate immune-related genes were examined during bacterial exposure. These genes correspond to three lectin-like molecules putatively involved in the recognition of pathogens, two metal-binding proteins putatively involved in antibacterial response and one cystein protease inhibitor. The transcription patterns of these selected genes provide new insights into the responses of coral colonies to virulent versus non-virulent bacteria."},{"title":"Whole-body kinematics of a fruit bat reveal the influence of wing inertia on body accelerations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1546","abstract":"The center of mass (COM) of a flying animal accelerates through space because of aerodynamic and gravitational forces. For vertebrates, changes in the position of a landmark on the body have been widely used to estimate net aerodynamic forces. The flapping of relatively massive wings, however, might induce inertial forces that cause markers on the body to move independently of the COM, thus making them unreliable indicators of aerodynamic force. We used high-speed three-dimensional kinematics from wind tunnel flights of four lesser dog-faced fruit bats, Cynopterus brachyotis, at speeds ranging from 2.4 to 7.8 m s–1 to construct a time-varying model of the mass distribution of the bats and to estimate changes in the position of their COM through time. We compared accelerations calculated by markers on the trunk with accelerations calculated from the estimated COM and we found significant inertial effects on both horizontal and vertical accelerations. We discuss the effect of these inertial accelerations on the long-held idea that, during slow flights, bats accelerate their COM forward during ‘tip-reversal upstrokes’, whereby the distal portion of the wing moves upward and backward with respect to still air. This idea has been supported by the observation that markers placed on the body accelerate forward during tip-reversal upstrokes. As in previously published studies, we observed that markers on the trunk accelerated forward during the tip-reversal upstrokes. When removing inertial effects, however, we found that the COM accelerated forward primarily during the downstroke. These results highlight the crucial importance of the incorporation of inertial effects of wing motion in the analysis of flapping flight."},{"title":"Failure by fatigue in the field: a model of fatigue breakage for the macroalga Mazzaella, with validation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1571","abstract":"Seaweeds inhabiting the extreme hydrodynamic environment of wave-swept shores break frequently. However, traditional biomechanical analyses, evaluating breakage due to the largest individual waves, have perennially underestimated rates of macroalgal breakage. Recent laboratory testing has established that some seaweeds fail by fatigue, accumulating damage over a series of force impositions. Failure by fatigue may thus account, in part, for the discrepancy between prior breakage predictions, based on individual not repeated wave forces, and reality. Nonetheless, the degree to which fatigue breaks seaweeds on wave-swept shores remains unknown. Here, we developed a model of fatigue breakage due to wave-induced forces for the macroalga Mazzaella flaccida. To test model performance, we made extensive measurements of M. flaccida breakage and of wave-induced velocities experienced by the macroalga. The fatigue-breakage model accounted for significantly more breakage than traditional prediction methods. For life history phases modeled most accurately, 105% (for female gametophytes) and 79% (for tetrasporophytes) of field-observed breakage was predicted, on average. When M. flaccida fronds displayed attributes such as temperature stress and substantial tattering, the fatigue-breakage model underestimated breakage, suggesting that these attributes weaken fronds and lead to more rapid breakage. Exposure to waves had the greatest influence on model performance. At the most wave-protected sites, the model underpredicted breakage, and at the most wave-exposed sites, it overpredicted breakage. Overall, our fatigue-breakage model strongly suggests that, in addition to occurring predictably in the laboratory, fatigue-induced breakage of M. flaccida occurs on wave-swept shores."},{"title":"Atypical properties of release and short-term depression at a specialized nicotinic synapse in the Mauthner cell network","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1560","abstract":"Many synapses exhibit temporally complex forms of activity-dependent short-term synaptic plasticity. The diversity of these phenomena reflects the evolutionary specialization of synapses within networks. We examined the properties of transmission and plasticity, in vivo, at an identified, specialized axo-axonic nicotinic synapse between the goldfish Mauthner cell and one of its targets, the cranial relay neuron (CRN), using intracellular paired recordings and low frequency (0.33–2 Hz) train stimulations. Depression of successive excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), which dominates short-term plasticity, had two components. A fast component reduced the amplitude of EPSP2, to less than 50% of EPSP1. A slow component produced an additional 10–30% of amplitude reduction and developed with a time constant of tens of seconds. The latencies of the later depressed responses were ∼0.1 ms longer than that of EPSP1, suggesting a reduced release probability. The Ca2+ chelators EGTA and BAPTA, injected presynaptically, reduced all EPSPs and slowed development of the second component of depression. Interestingly, spike broadening, produced by injecting K+ channel blockers, reduced release, but accelerated the kinetics of the slow component. Finally, Ba2+ in the external medium enhanced release, and reduced the first component and slowed the development of the second component of depression. Taken together, these last two results, which are in contrast to observations at other synapses, and the two-component depression suggest atypical release properties at the output synapses of the Mauthner cell, which triggers an escape behavior. We suggest that the second component of depression provides an additional safety factor to prevent repetitive firing of the CRN."},{"title":"Avoidance of achromatic colours by bees provides a private niche for hummingbirds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1607","abstract":"That hummingbird-pollinated plants predominantly have red flowers has been known for decades, but well-investigated research studies are still rare. Preference tests have shown that hummingbirds do not have an innate preference for red colours. In addition, hummingbirds do not depend solely upon red flowers, because white-flowered hummingbird-pollinated plants are also common and temporarily abundant. Here we show that both white and red hummingbird-pollinated flowers differ from bee-pollinated flowers in their reflection properties for ultraviolet (UV) light. Hummingbird-pollinated red flowers are on average less UV reflective, and white hummingbird-pollinated flowers are more UV reflective than the same coloured bee-pollinated ones. In preference tests with artificial flowers, neotropical orchid bees prefer red UV-reflecting artificial flowers and white UV-nonreflecting flowers over red and white flowers with the opposite UV properties. By contrast, hummingbirds showed no preference for any colour in the same tests. Plotting floral colours and test stimuli into the honeybees' perceptual colour space suggests that the less attractive colours are achromatic for bees and therefore more difficult to detect against the background. This underlying colour preference in bees might provide hummingbirds with a private niche that is not attractive to bees."},{"title":"Regulation of leptin synthesis during adipogenesis in males of a vespertilionid bat, Scotophilus heathi","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1599","abstract":"The aim of this study was to elucidate the hormonal regulation of leptin synthesis by the white adipose tissue (WAT) during the period of fat accumulation in male Scotophilus heathi. An in vivo study showed a significant correlation between the seasonal changes in serum insulin level with the circulating leptin level and with the changes in body fat mass in S. heathi. An in vitro study showed insulin induced a significant increase in expression of leptin protein in WAT. The insulin-stimulated increase in leptin expression was associated with increased uptake of glucose in the WAT. Two glucose transporters (GLUT4 and GLUT8) are utilized for transport of glucose in the WAT during adipogenesis in the bat. The bats showed high insulin and glucose levels, but a reduction in insulin receptor protein during the period of fat deposition, suggesting insulin resistance, which improved in late winter (January) when most of the fat has been utilized as a metabolic fuel. The in vitro study confirmed that insulin enhanced leptin and GLUT4 expression in WAT. The in vitro study further showed that the expression of leptin is directly proportional to the amount of glucose uptake by the WAT. The expression of GLUT4 and GLUT8 were also shown to be differentially regulated by insulin during adipogenesis. The insulin-stimulated increase in leptin synthesis by WAT is mediated through phosphorylation of MAPK in S. heathi. The specific role of GLUT4 and GLUT8 in the regulation of leptin synthesis during adipogenesis needs further investigation."},{"title":"Neuronal processing of translational optic flow in the visual system of the shore crab Carcinus maenas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/9/1586","abstract":"This paper describes a search for neurones sensitive to optic flow in the visual system of the shore crab Carcinus maenas using a procedure developed from that of Krapp and Hengstenberg. This involved determining local motion sensitivity and its directional selectivity at many points within the neurone's receptive field and plotting the results on a map. Our results showed that local preferred directions of motion are independent of velocity, stimulus shape and type of motion (circular or linear). Global response maps thus clearly represent real properties of the neurones' receptive fields. Using this method, we have discovered two families of interneurones sensitive to translational optic flow. The first family has its terminal arborisations in the lobula of the optic lobe, the second family in the medulla. The response maps of the lobula neurones (which appear to be monostratified lobular giant neurones) show a clear focus of expansion centred on or just above the horizon, but at significantly different azimuth angles. Response maps such as these, consisting of patterns of movement vectors radiating from a pole, would be expected of neurones responding to self-motion in a particular direction. They would be stimulated when the crab moves towards the pole of the neurone's receptive field. The response maps of the medulla neurones show a focus of contraction, approximately centred on the horizon, but at significantly different azimuth angles. Such neurones would be stimulated when the crab walked away from the pole of the neurone's receptive field. We hypothesise that both the lobula and the medulla interneurones are representatives of arrays of cells, each of which would be optimally activated by self-motion in a different direction. The lobula neurones would be stimulated by the approaching scene and the medulla neurones by the receding scene. Neurones tuned to translational optic flow provide information on the three-dimensional layout of the environment and are thought to play a role in the judgment of heading."},{"title":"The triterpene glycosides of Holothuria forskali: usefulness and efficiency as a chemical defense mechanism against predatory fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1347","abstract":"More than 100 triterpene glycosides (saponins) have been characterized in holothuroids in the past several decades. In particular, Holothuria forskali contains 26 saponins in its Cuvierian tubules and 12 in its body wall. This high diversity could be linked to a chemical defense mechanism, the most commonly accepted biological role for these secondary metabolites. We performed an integrated study of the body-wall saponins of H. forskali. The saponins are mainly localized in the epidermis and in the mesothelium of the body wall and appear to be released when the holothuroid is stressed. Among the saponins present in the epidermis, one (holothurinoside G) was detected in the seawater surrounding non-stressed holothuroids and three others (holohurinosides C and F, and desholothurin A) were secreted when the animals were stressed. In addition, two new congeners (detected at m/z 1301 and 1317) were also present in the immediate surroundings of stressed holothuroids. These new saponins do not originate from the epidermis and could come from an internal organ. Quantities of secreted saponins were very low compared with the body wall and Cuvierian tubules concentrations. At natural concentrations, saponins do not represent a threat to the health of predatory fish. The deterrent effect of saponins seems therefore to act as an aposematic signal, warning potential predators of the unpalatability of the holothuroid tissues."},{"title":"Early development and molecular plasticity in the Mediterranean sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus exposed to CO2-driven acidification","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1357","abstract":"Ocean acidification is predicted to have significant effects on benthic calcifying invertebrates, in particular on their early developmental stages. Echinoderm larvae could be particularly vulnerable to decreased pH, with major consequences for adult populations. The objective of this study was to understand how ocean acidification would affect the initial life stages of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, a common species that is widely distributed in the Mediterranean Sea and the NE Atlantic. The effects of decreased pH (elevated PCO2) were investigated through physiological and molecular analyses on both embryonic and larval stages. Eggs and larvae were reared in Mediterranean seawater at six pH levels, i.e. pHT 8.1, 7.9, 7.7, 7.5, 7.25 and 7.0. Fertilization success, survival, growth and calcification rates were monitored over a 3 day period. The expression of genes coding for key proteins involved in development and biomineralization was also monitored. Paracentrotus lividus appears to be extremely resistant to low pH, with no effect on fertilization success or larval survival. Larval growth was slowed when exposed to low pH but with no direct impact on relative larval morphology or calcification down to pHT 7.25. Consequently, at a given time, larvae exposed to low pH were present at a normal but delayed larval stage. More surprisingly, candidate genes involved in development and biomineralization were upregulated by factors of up to 26 at low pH. Our results revealed plasticity at the gene expression level that allows a normal, but delayed, development under low pH conditions."},{"title":"Burrowing and subsurface locomotion in anguilliform fish: behavioral specializations and mechanical constraints","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1379","abstract":"Fish swimming is probably one of the most studied and best understood locomotor behaviors in vertebrates. However, many fish also actively exploit sediments. Because of their elongate body shape, anguilliform fishes are not only efficient swimmers but also very maneuverable. Consequently, many species live in complexly structured environments near the bottom and many are known to burrow into the sediment. To better understand burrowing and subsurface locomotion in anguilliform fish we provide descriptive kinematic data on subsurface locomotion in a burrowing eel (Pisodonophis boro) using videofluoroscopy. We also measured the maximal forces that can be exerted by this species during head-first and tail-first burrowing, and explored the implications of head-first burrowing on mechanical stress distribution in the skull. Our data show that P. boro uses lateral undulation to penetrate and move in sandy sediments under water. The kinematics of subsurface locomotion are different from those observed during swimming and are characterized by a very high slip factor. These observations differ considerably from recently published data in terrestrial sand-swimming lizards, and suggest that the sediment behaves like a solid rather than a frictional fluid. Finally, our finite element models show that the cranial shape and structure in the head-first burrowing P. boro is mechanically more suited for head-first burrowing than that of an obligate tail-first burrowing species, Heteroconger hassi."},{"title":"Flower constancy in honey bee workers (Apis mellifera) depends on ecologically realistic rewards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1397","abstract":"As first described by Aristotle, honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers show a strong tendency to visit flowers of only one type during a foraging trip. It is known that workers rapidly learn a flower colour when rewarded with artificial nectar (sucrose solution). However, some previous studies report that the degree of constancy after training is unaffected by reward quantity and quality when bees are tested in an array of artificial flowers of two easily distinguished colours, such as blue and yellow. One possible reason for this surprising result is that large reward volumes were compared. This is likely to mask the abilities of foragers to make adaptive decisions under more realistic conditions. To test this possibility, we offered untrained honey bee workers ecologically relevant rewards (0.5, 1 or 2 μl of 0.5 or 1 mol l–1 sucrose solution) on one or two consecutive yellow or blue artificial flowers and then recorded which flowers the bees subsequently landed on in an array of 40 empty flowers. The results showed that an increase in all three factors (volume, concentration and number of rewards) significantly increased constancy (proportion of visits to flowers of the trained colour) and persistence (number of flowers visited) during the foraging bout. Constancy for the least rewarding situation was 75.9% compared with 98.6% for the most rewarding situation. These results clearly show that honey bee workers do become more constant to blue or yellow with increasing nectar rewards, provided that the rewards used are ecologically realistic. As the most rewarding conditions led to nearly 100% constancy, further reward increases during training would not have been able to further increase constancy. This explains why previous studies comparing large rewards found no effect of reward on constancy."},{"title":"Identification, tissue distribution and orexigenic activity of neuropeptide F (NPF) in penaeid shrimp","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1386","abstract":"The neuropeptide Fs (NPFs) are an invertebrate subgroup of the FMRFamide-like peptides, and are proposed by some to be the homologs of vertebrate neuropeptide Y. Although there is some information about the identity, tissue distribution and function of NPFs in insects, essentially nothing is known about them in crustaceans. We have identified and characterized NPF-encoding transcripts from the penaeid shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei and Melicertus marginatus. Two transcripts were identified from each species. For each shrimp species, the two transcripts differed from one another by the presence or absence of an insert in the portion of the open reading frame that encodes the NPF peptide. The two NPF isoforms are identical in L. vannamei and M. marginatus, with their predicted structures being KPDPSQLANMAEALKYLQELDKYYSQVSRPRFamide and KPDPSQLANMAEALKYLQELDKYYSQVSRPSPRSAPGPASQIQALENTLKFLQLQELGKLYSLRARPRFamide. RT-PCR tissue profiling showed both transcripts are broadly distributed within the nervous system of each species. The transcript encoding the shorter NPF was detected in some, but not all, midgut samples. The transcript encoding the longer NPF was absent in the midgut of both species, and neither transcript was detected in their skeletal muscle. Juvenile L. vannamei fed on a diet supplemented with the shorter NPF exhibited a marked increase in food intake relative to control individuals that did not receive the supplement; the NPF-fed shrimp also showed a significant increase in growth relative to the control group. Our data suggest that NPF is present in both the nervous system and midgut of penaeid shrimp, functioning, at least in part, as a powerful orexigenic agent."},{"title":"Thermal effects on the dynamics and motor control of ballistic prey capture in toads: maintaining high performance at low temperature","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1333","abstract":"Temperature has a strong influence on biological rates, including the contractile rate properties of muscle and thereby the velocity, acceleration and power of muscle-powered movements. We hypothesized that the dynamics of movements powered by elastic recoil have a lower thermal dependence than muscle-powered movements. We examined the prey capture behavior of toads (Bufo terrestris) using high speed imaging and electromyography to compare the effects of body temperature (11–35°C) on the kinematics, dynamics and motor control of two types of movement: (1) ballistic mouth opening and tongue projection, which are powered by elastic recoil, and (2) non-ballistic prey transport, including tongue retraction and mouth closing, which are powered directly by muscle contraction. Over 11–25°C, temperature coefficients of ballistic mouth opening and tongue projection dynamics (Q10 of 0.99–1.25) were not significantly different from 1.00 and were consistently lower than those of prey transport movements (Q10 of 1.77–2.26), supporting our main hypothesis. The depressor mandibulae muscle, which is responsible for ballistic mouth opening and tongue projection via the recovery of elastic strain energy stored by the muscle prior to the onset of the movement, was activated earlier and for a longer duration at lower temperatures (Q10 of 2.29–2.41), consistent with a slowing of its contractile rates. Muscle recruitment was unaffected by temperature, as revealed by the lack of thermal dependence in the intensity of activity of both the jaw depressor and jaw levator muscles (Q10 of 0.754–1.12). Over the 20–35°C range, lower thermal dependence was found for the dynamics of non-elastic movements and the motor control of both elastic and non-elastic movements, in accord with a plateau of high performance found in other systems."},{"title":"Cortisol response to stress is associated with myocardial remodeling in salmonid fishes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1313","abstract":"Cardiac disease is frequently reported in farmed animals, and stress has been implicated as a factor for myocardial dysfunction in commercial fish rearing. Cortisol is a major stress hormone in teleosts, and this hormone has adverse effects on the myocardium. Strains of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) selected for divergent post-stress cortisol levels [high responsive (HR) and low responsive (LR)] have been established as a comparative model to examine how fish with contrasting stress-coping styles differ in their physiological and behavioral profiles. We show that the mean cardiosomatic index (CSI) of adult HR fish was 34% higher than in LR fish, mainly because of hypertrophy of the compact myocardium. To characterize the hypertrophy as physiological or pathological, we investigated specific cardiac markers at the transcriptional level. HR hearts had higher mRNA levels of cortisol receptors (MR, GR1 and GR2), increased RCAN1 levels [suggesting enhanced pro-hypertrophic nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) signaling] and increased VEGF gene expression (reflecting increased angiogenesis). Elevated collagen (Col1a2) expression and deposition in HR hearts supported enhanced fibrosis, whereas the heart failure markers ANP and BNP were not upregulated in HR hearts. To confirm our results outside the selection model, we investigated the effect of acute confinement stress in wild-type European brown trout, Salmo trutta. A positive correlation between post-stress cortisol levels and CSI was observed, supporting an association between enhanced cortisol response and myocardial remodeling. In conclusion, post-stress cortisol production correlates with myocardial remodeling, and coincides with several indicators of heart pathology, well-known from mammalian cardiology."},{"title":"Flight restriction prevents associative learning deficits but not changes in brain protein-adduct formation during honeybee ageing","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1322","abstract":"Honeybees (Apis mellifera) senesce within 2 weeks after they discontinue nest tasks in favour of foraging. Foraging involves metabolically demanding flight, which in houseflies (Musca domestica) and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) is associated with markers of ageing such as increased mortality and accumulation of oxidative damage. The role of flight in honeybee ageing is incompletely understood. We assessed relationships between honeybee flight activity and ageing by simulating rain that confined foragers to their colonies most of the day. After 15 days on average, flight-restricted foragers were compared with bees with normal (free) flight: one group that foraged for ∼15 days and two additional control groups, for flight duration and chronological age, that foraged for ∼5 days. Free flight over 15 days on average resulted in impaired associative learning ability. In contrast, flight-restricted foragers did as well in learning as bees that foraged for 5 days on average. This negative effect of flight activity was not influenced by chronological age or gustatory responsiveness, a measure of the bees' motivation to learn. Contrasting their intact learning ability, flight-restricted bees accrued the most oxidative brain damage as indicated by malondialdehyde protein adduct levels in crude cytosolic fractions. Concentrations of mono- and poly-ubiquitinated brain proteins were equal between the groups, whereas differences in total protein amounts suggested changes in brain protein metabolism connected to forager age, but not flight. We propose that intense flight is causal to brain deficits in aged bees, and that oxidative protein damage is unlikely to be the underlying mechanism."},{"title":"Slipping, sliding and stability: locomotor strategies for overcoming low-friction surfaces","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1369","abstract":"Legged terrestrial animals must avoid falling while negotiating unexpected perturbations inherent to their structurally complex environments. Among humans, fatal and nonfatal injuries frequently result from slip-induced falls precipitated by sudden unexpected encounters with low-friction surfaces. Although studies using walking human models have identified some causes of falls and mechanisms underlying slip prevention, it is unclear whether these apply to various locomotor speeds and other species. We used high-speed video and inverse dynamics to investigate the locomotor biomechanics of helmeted guinea fowl traversing slippery surfaces at variable running speeds (1.3–3.6 m s–1). Falls were circumvented when limb contact angles exceeded 70 deg, though lower angles were tolerated at faster running speeds (>3.0 m s–1). These prerequisites permitted a forward shift of the body's center of mass over the limb's base of support, which kept slip distances below 10 cm (the threshold distance for falls) and maximized the vertical ground reaction forces, thus facilitating limb retraction and the conclusion of the stance phase. These postural control strategies for slip avoidance parallel those in humans, demonstrating the applicability of these strategies across locomotor gaits and the potential for guinea fowl as an insightful model for invasive approaches to understanding limb neuromuscular control on slippery surfaces."},{"title":"Growth patterns and nuclear distribution in white muscle fibers from black sea bass, Centropristis striata: evidence for the influence of diffusion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1230","abstract":"This study investigated the influence of fiber size on the distribution of nuclei and fiber growth patterns in white muscle of black sea bass, Centropristis striata, ranging in body mass from 0.45 to 4840 g. Nuclei were counted in 1 μm optical sections using confocal microscopy of DAPIand Acridine-Orange-stained muscle fibers. Mean fiber diameter increased from 36±0.87 μm in the 0.45 g fish to 280±5.47 μm in the 1885 g fish. Growth beyond 2000 g triggered the recruitment of smaller fibers, thus significantly reducing mean fiber diameter. Nuclei in the smaller fibers were exclusively subsarcolemmal (SS), whereas in larger fibers nuclei were more numerous and included intermyofibrillar (IM) nuclei. There was a significant effect of body mass on nuclear domain size (F=118.71, d.f.=3, P<0.0001), which increased to a maximum in fish of medium size (282–1885 g) and then decreased in large fish (>2000 g). Although an increase in the number of nuclei during fiber growth can help preserve the myonuclear domain, the appearance of IM nuclei during hypertrophic growth seems to be aimed at maintaining short effective diffusion distances for nuclear substrates and products. If only SS nuclei were present throughout growth, the diffusion distance would increase in proportion to the radius of the fibers. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in nuclear distribution and fiber growth patterns are mechanisms for avoiding diffusion limitation during animal growth."},{"title":"Oxidative stress is transient and tissue specific during cold acclimation of threespine stickleback","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1248","abstract":"Linkages between cold acclimation and oxidative stress in fishes are unclear and contradictory results have been published. We sought to determine whether oxidative stress occurs during cold acclimation of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and, if so, when it occurs and whether it varies among tissues. Fish were warm (20°C) or cold (8°C) acclimated for 9 weeks, and harvested during acclimation. Oxidative stress was assessed in oxidative and glycolytic muscles and liver by measuring levels of protein carbonyls and glutathione, and the activity and transcript levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Protein carbonyl levels increased in liver after 1 week at 8°C and then decreased after week 4, and remained unchanged in glycolytic and oxidative muscle. Glutathione levels increased in liver on day 3 of cold acclimation and may minimize oxidative stress later during acclimation. When measured at a common temperature, the activity of SOD increased in oxidative and glycolytic muscles on day 2 of cold acclimation, and on day 3 in liver, and remained elevated in all tissues compared with warm-acclimated animals. When measured at the acclimation temperature, the activity of SOD was significantly higher only at week 9 in oxidative muscle of cold-acclimated stickleback compared with warm-acclimated fish, and remained constant in glycolytic muscle and liver. Increased SOD activity in oxidative muscle may be required to prevent oxidative stress brought about by increased mitochondrial density. In both muscle and liver, SOD activity increased independently of an increase in transcript level, suggesting post-translational modifications regulate SOD activity."},{"title":"Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) show microstructural bone loss during hibernation but preserve bone macrostructural geometry and strength","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1240","abstract":"Lack of activity causes bone loss In most animals. Hibernating bears have physiological processes to prevent cortical and trabecular bone loss associated with reduced physical activity, but different mechanisms of torpor among hibernating species may lead to differences in skeletal responses to hibernation. There are conflicting reports regarding whether small mammals experience bone loss during hibernation. To investigate this phenomenon, we measured cortical and trabecular bone properties in physically active and hibernating juvenile and adult 13-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus, previous genus name Spermophilus). Cortical bone geometry, strength and mineral content were similar in hibernating compared with active squirrels, suggesting that hibernation did not cause macrostructural cortical bone loss. Osteocyte lacunar size increased (linear regression, P=0.001) over the course of hibernation in juvenile squirrels, which may indicate an osteocytic role in mineral homeostasis during hibernation. Osteocyte lacunar density and porosity were greater (+44 and +59%, respectively; P<0.0001) in hibernating compared with active squirrels, which may reflect a decrease in osteoblastic activity (per cell) during hibernation. Trabecular bone volume fraction in the proximal tibia was decreased (–20%; P=0.028) in hibernating compared with physically active adult squirrels, but was not different between hibernating and active juvenile squirrels. Taken together, these data suggest that 13-lined ground squirrels may be unable to prevent microstructural losses of cortical and trabecular bone during hibernation, but importantly may possess a biological mechanism to preserve cortical bone macrostructure and strength during hibernation, thus preventing an increased risk of bone fracture during remobilization in the spring."},{"title":"Regulatory function of hyperosmotic stress-induced signaling cascades in the expression of transcription factors and osmolyte transporters in freshwater Japanese eel primary gill cell culture","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1264","abstract":"In the present study, we investigated the early activation of osmotic stress-related protein kinases, with the aim of characterizing their functional links with downstream effectors (i.e. transcription factors and osmolyte transporters). Freshwater eel primary gill cells were cultured in hypertonic medium (500 mosmol l–1) for 6 h. Protein lysates and total RNA were collected for western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR assays. In this study, the osmotic challenge stimulated histone H3 phosphorylation, various signaling pathways (i.e. ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK, CREB, MARCKS and MLCK) and expression of some downstream effectors (i.e. Na+/K+-ATPase, TauT and Ostf). Increased phosphorylation of acetylated histone is known to promote chromatin relaxation for global gene transcription, probably leading to the activation of downstream effectors for osmotic responses. In addition, the importance of the p38 MAPK and MLCK pathways in the regulation of the expression of Na+/K+-ATPase and TauT was demonstrated. Inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway by SB202190 reduced histone H3 phosphorylation and TauT mRNA expression. Moreover, inhibition of the MLCK pathway by ML-7 decreased the expression level of Na+/K+-ATPase but increased the transcript level of TauT. Collectively, the present study reveals possible functional links of osmosensing signaling cascades to the regulation of downstream effectors."},{"title":"Significant dissociation of expression patterns of the basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors Dec1 and Dec2 in rat kidney","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1257","abstract":"Dec1 and Dec2 are regulators of the mammalian molecular clock that show robust circadian rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and various peripheral tissues. Although the expression of Dec1 and Dec2 is altered by multiple stimuli in different organs, their transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have not been fully elucidated for the kidney. In the present study, we describe for the first time significant dissociation of expression patterns with arrhythmic expression of Dec1 and rhythmic expression of Dec2 in rat kidney under a normal light–dark (LD) cycle. Daytime restricted feeding (RF) significantly altered the expression patterns of these two clock genes, and even induced circadian expression of Dec1 with an amplitude of 2.2 on day 3 and 4.2 on day 7. However, when a reversed feeding schedule was coupled with a reversed LD cycle, the expression of Dec1 but not Dec2 reverted to being arrhythmic. Moreover, exogenous injection of the glucocorticoid analogue dexamethasone (Dex) at certain times of the day resulted in rhythmic expression of Dec1, which was similar to that seen following RF for 7 days. In contrast, endogenous disruption of glucocorticoids by adrenalectomy abolished RF-induced rhythmic expression of Dec1 in the kidney. These observations suggest the existence of a glucocorticoid gating mechanism in the circadian expression of Dec1 in rat kidney."},{"title":"Effects of temperature on responses to anoxia and oxygen reperfusion in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1271","abstract":"Insects in general, and Drosophila in particular, are much more capable of surviving anoxia than vertebrates, and the mechanisms involved are of considerable biomedical and ecological interest. Temperature is likely to strongly affect both the rates of damage occurring in anoxia and the recovery processes in normoxia, but as yet there is no information on the effect of this crucial variable on recovery rates from anoxia in any animal. We studied the effects of temperature, and thus indirectly of metabolic flux rates, on survival and recovery times of individual male Drosophila melanogaster following anoxia and O2 reperfusion. Individual flies were reared at 25°C and exposed to an anoxic period of 7.5, 25, 42.5 or 60 min at 20, 25 or 30°C. Before, during and after anoxic exposure the flies' metabolic rates (MRs), rates of water loss and activity indices were recorded. Temperature strongly affected the MR of the flies, with a Q10 of 2.21. Temperature did not affect the slope of the relationship between time to recovery and duration of anoxic exposure, suggesting that thermal effects on damage and repair rates were similar. However, the intercept of that relationship was significantly lower (i.e. recovery was most rapid) at 25°C, which was the rearing temperature. When temperatures during exposure to anoxia and during recovery were switched, recovery times matched those predicted from a model in which the accumulation and clearance of metabolic end-products share a similar dependence on temperature."},{"title":"Reversible remodeling of lung tissue during hibernation in the Syrian hamster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1276","abstract":"During hibernation, small rodents such as hamsters cycle through phases of strongly suppressed metabolism with low body temperature (torpor) and full restoration of metabolism and body temperature (arousal). Remarkably, the repetitive stress of cooling–rewarming and hypoxia does not cause irreversible organ damage. To identify adaptive mechanisms protecting the lungs, we assessed histological changes as well as the expression and localization of proteins involved in tissue remodeling in lungs from Syrian hamsters at different phases of hibernation using immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis. In torpor (early and late) phase, a reversible increased expression of smooth muscle actin, collagen, angiotensin converting enzyme and transforming growth factor-β was found, whereas expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor and caveolin-1 was low. Importantly, all these alterations were restored during arousal. This study demonstrates substantial alterations in protein expression mainly in epithelial cells of lungs from hibernating Syrian hamsters. These structural changes of the bronchial airway structure are termed airway remodeling and often occur in obstructive lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung fibrosis. Unraveling the molecular mechanism leading to reversal of airway remodeling by the end of torpor may identify possible therapeutic targets to reduce progression of this process in patients suffering from asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung fibrosis."},{"title":"Ocellar adaptations for dim light vision in a nocturnal bee","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1283","abstract":"Growing evidence indicates that insect ocelli are strongly adapted to meet the specific functional requirements in the environment in which that insect lives. We investigated how the ocelli of the nocturnal bee Megalopta genalis are adapted to life in the dim understory of a tropical rainforest. Using a combination of light microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction, we found that the retinae contain bar-shaped rhabdoms loosely arranged in a radial pattern around multi-layered lenses, and that both lenses and retinae form complex non-spherical shapes reminiscent of those described in other ocelli. Intracellular electrophysiology revealed that the photoreceptors have high absolute sensitivity, but that the threshold location varied widely between 109 and 1011 photons cm–2 s–1. Higher sensitivity and greater visual reliability may be obtained at the expense of temporal resolution: the corner frequencies of dark-adapted ocellar photoreceptors were just 4–11 Hz. Spectral sensitivity profiles consistently peaked at 500 nm. Unlike the ocelli of other flying insects, we did not detect UV-sensitive visual pigments in M. genalis, which may be attributable to a scarcity of UV photons under the rainforest canopy at night. In contrast to earlier predictions based on anatomy, the photoreceptors are not sensitive to the e-vector of polarised light. Megalopta genalis ocellar photoreceptors possess a number of unusual properties, including inherently high response variability and the ability to produce spike-like potentials. These properties bear similarities to photoreceptors in the compound eye of the cockroach, and we suggest that the two insects share physiological characteristics optimised for vision in dim light."},{"title":"Hibernating above the permafrost: effects of ambient temperature and season on expression of metabolic genes in liver and brown adipose tissue of arctic ground squirrels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1300","abstract":"Hibernating arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii), overwintering in frozen soils, maintain large gradients between ambient temperature (Ta) and body temperature (Tb) by substantially increasing metabolic rate during torpor while maintaining a subzero Tb. We used quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine how the expression of 56 metabolic genes was affected by season (active in summer vs hibernating), metabolic load during torpor (imposed by differences in Ta: +2 vs –10°C) and hibernation state (torpid vs after arousal). Compared with active ground squirrels sampled in summer, liver from hibernators showed increased expression of genes associated with fatty acid catabolism (CPT1A, FABP1 and ACAT1), ketogenesis (HMGCS2) and gluconeogenesis (PCK1) and decreased expression of genes associated with fatty acid synthesis (ACACB, SCD and ELOVL6), amino acid metabolism, the urea cycle (PAH, BCKDHA and OTC), glycolysis (PDK1 and PFKM) and lipid metabolism (ACAT2). Stage of hibernation (torpid vs aroused) had a much smaller effect, with only one gene associated with glycogen synthesis (GSY1) in liver showing consistent differences in expression levels between temperature treatments. Despite the more than eightfold increase in energetic demand associated with defending Tb during torpor at a Ta of –10 vs +2°C, transcript levels in liver and brown adipose tissue differed little. Our results are inconsistent with a hypothesized switch to use of non-lipid fuels when ambient temperatures drop below freezing."},{"title":"Prolonged fasting increases glutathione biosynthesis in postweaned northern elephant seals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1294","abstract":"Northern elephant seals experience prolonged periods of absolute food and water deprivation (fasting) while breeding, molting or weaning. The postweaning fast in elephant seals is characterized by increases in the renin–angiotensin system, expression of the oxidant-producing protein Nox4, and NADPH oxidase activity; however, these increases are not correlated with increased oxidative damage or inflammation. Glutathione (GSH) is a potent reductant and a cofactor for glutathione peroxidases (GPx), glutathione-S transferases (GST) and 1-cys peroxiredoxin (PrxVI) and thus contributes to the removal of hydroperoxides, preventing oxidative damage. The effects of prolonged food deprivation on the GSH system are not well described in mammals. To test our hypothesis that GSH biosynthesis increases with fasting in postweaned elephant seals, we measured circulating and muscle GSH content at the early and late phases of the postweaning fast in elephant seals along with the activity/protein content of glutamate-cysteine ligase [GCL; catalytic (GCLc) and modulatory (GCLm) subunits], γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), glutathione disulphide reductase (GR), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), GST and PrxVI, as well as plasma changes in γ-glutamyl amino acids, glutamate and glutamine. GSH increased two- to four-fold with fasting along with a 40–50% increase in the content of GCLm and GCLc, a 75% increase in GGT activity, a two- to 2.5-fold increase in GR, G6PDH and GST activities and a 30% increase in PrxVI content. Plasma γ-glutamyl glutamine, γ-glutamyl isoleucine and γ-glutamyl methionine also increased with fasting whereas glutamate and glutamine decreased. Results indicate that GSH biosynthesis increases with fasting and that GSH contributes to counteracting hydroperoxide production, preventing oxidative damage in fasting seals."},{"title":"Temperature effects on Ca2+ cycling in scombrid cardiomyocytes: a phylogenetic comparison","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1068","abstract":"Specialisations in excitation–contraction coupling may have played an important role in the evolution of endothermy and high cardiac performance in scombrid fishes. We examined aspects of Ca2+ handling in cardiomyocytes from Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis). The whole-cell voltage-clamp technique was used to measure the temperature sensitivity of the L-type Ca2+ channel current (ICa), density, and steady-state and maximal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content (ssSRload and maxSRload). Current–voltage relations, peak ICa density and charge density of ICa were greatest in mackerel and yellowfin at all temperatures tested. ICa density and kinetics were temperature sensitive in all species studied, and the magnitude of this response was not related to the thermal preference of the species. SRload was greater in atrial than in ventricular myocytes in the Pacific bluefin tuna, and in species that are more cold tolerant (bluefin tuna and mackerel). ICa and SRload were particularly small in bonito, suggesting the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger plays a more pivotal role in Ca2+ entry into cardiomyocytes of this species. Our comparative approach reveals that the SR of cold-tolerant scombrid fishes has a greater capacity for Ca2+ storage. This specialisation may contribute to the temperature tolerance and thermal niche expansion of the bluefin tuna and mackerel."},{"title":"Desert ants benefit from combining visual and olfactory landmarks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1307","abstract":"The desert ant, Cataglyphis fortis, uses both visual and olfactory cues to guide its return to the nest. The ants use vision-based path integration for long-distance navigation and memorize the visual and olfactory surrounding of the nest to finally locate the entrance. In the present study we investigated how the visual and the olfactory navigation systems interact. In field experiments ants were trained to associate the nest with a visual cue, an olfactory cue or a combination of both cues. We tested ants after one, five and 15 training runs, to investigate whether the ants would make use of the training cues to pinpoint the nest. We found that they were slow to learn the location of the nest when it was specified by just an olfactory or a visual cue. However, the ants focused their nest search after the first training run with the combined cue. Equally experienced ants responded to the individually presented visual or olfactory cues with the same high accuracy as they did to the combined cue. After 15 training runs, the combined cue still evoked an accurate response in the test, whereas the individually presented cues no longer did. Apparently, C. fortis benefit from combining their visual and olfactory navigational tools, because the bimodal sensory input accelerates the acquisition of landmark information."},{"title":"Patterns of tropomyosin and troponin-T isoform expression in jaw-closing muscles of mammals and reptiles that express masticatory myosin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1077","abstract":"We recently reported that masticatory (‘superfast’) myosin is expressed in jaw-closing muscles of some rodent species. Most mammalian limb muscle fibers express tropomyosin-β (Tm-β), along with fast-type or slow-type tropomyosin-β (Tm-β), but jaw-closing muscle fibers in members of Carnivora express a unique isoform of Tm [Tm-masticatory (Tm-M)] and little or no Tm-β. The goal of this study was to determine patterns of Tm and troponin-T (TnT) isoform expression in the jaw-closing muscles of rodents and other vertebrate species that express masticatory myosin, and compare the results to those from members of Carnivora. Comparisons of electrophoretic mobility, immunoblotting and mass spectrometry were used to probe the Tm and fast-type TnT isoform composition of jaw-closing and limb muscles of six species of Carnivora, eight species of Rodentia, five species of Marsupialia, big brown bat, long-tailed macaque and six species of Reptilia. Extensive heterogeneity exists in Tm and TnT isoform expression in jaw-closing muscles between phylogenetic groups, but there are fairly consistent patterns within each group. We propose that the differences in Tm and TnT isoform expression patterns between phylogenetic groups, which share the expression of masticatory myosin, may impart fundamental differences in thin-filament-mediated muscle activation to accommodate markedly different feeding styles that may require high force generation in some species (e.g. many members of Carnivora) and high speed in others (e.g. Rodentia)."},{"title":"The effect of ambient humidity and metabolic rate on the gas-exchange pattern of the semi-aquatic insect Aquarius remigis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1086","abstract":"We have examined the effects of temperature on metabolic rate and respiratory pattern in the water strider Aquarius remigis. As temperature was increased from 10 to 30°C, the metabolic rate of the insects increased and the respiratory pattern transitioned from discontinuous, to cyclic, to continuous. The discontinuous gas-exchange cycle (DGC) was observed even in insects standing on water when the respirometry chamber was being perfused with humid (>95% relative humidity) air. Comparisons of insects at 20°C in humid and dry air showed no statistically significant differences in metabolic rate or respiratory pattern (P>0.05). The proportion of time that the spiracles were closed was greater at 10°C than at 20°C (P<0.01), and greater at 20°C than at 30°C (P<0.05). These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the respiratory patterns of insects are determined by the relationship between oxygen supply and oxygen demand. There was no evidence in this insect that humidity had any effect on the respiratory pattern. The results are discussed in the context of the ongoing discussion in the literature of the origin, maintenance and adaptive significance of the DGC in insects."},{"title":"The integration of locomotion and prey capture in divergent cottid fishes: functional disparity despite morphological similarity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1092","abstract":"Many mobile animals rely on the integration of locomotion and feeding to capture prey. Fishes commonly swim up to a prey item and utilize a combination of ram and suction feeding for prey capture. Marine cottids represent a diverse and abundant lineage of fishes that exhibit variation in feeding mode that is related to their mouth morphology. However, little is known regarding the integration of the locomotor and feeding systems during prey capture. We quantified the feeding kinematics, feeding performance and integration of locomotion and feeding in two species of divergent cottids: Blepsias cirrhosus (silver-spotted sculpin) and Oligocottus maculosus (tidepool sculpin). Individuals were caught from sympatric habitats near the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre on Vancouver Island and filmed with a high-speed video camera (500 Hz) while feeding on amphipod prey. Two principal component axes summarize differences in integration and feeding mode despite similarity in attack velocity and feeding morphology (peak gape, peak cranial elevation and peak jaw protrusion). A greater number of correlations between locomotor and feeding variables in B. cirrhosus, compared with O. maculosus, indicate greater integration. We conclude that traditional measures of attack kinematics do not capture functionally and ecologically relevant differences between species. The mechanisms underlying differences in locomotor strategy likely result from unexplored morphological or ecological differences between species. In cottids, integration is apparent in more basal, subtidal species such as B. cirrhosus, and the need for integration may be superceded by demands from the habitat in more derived, shallow-water species such as O. maculosus."},{"title":"Toe function and dynamic pressure distribution in ostrich locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1123","abstract":"The ostrich is highly specialized in terrestrial locomotion and is the only extant bird that is both didactyl and exhibits a permanently elevated metatarsophalangeal joint. This extreme degree of digitigrady provides an excellent opportunity for the study of phalangeal adaptation towards fast, sustained bipedal locomotion. Data were gathered in a semi-natural setting with hand-raised, cooperative specimens. Dynamic pressure distribution, centre of pressure (CoP) trajectory and the positional inter-relationship of the toes during stance phase were investigated using pedobarography. Walking and running trials shared a J-shaped CoP trajectory with greater localization of CoP origin as speed increased. Slight variations of 4th toe position in walking affect CoP origin and modulation of 4th toe pressure on the substrate allows correction of balance, primarily at the beginning of stance phase at lower speeds. Load distribution patterns differed significantly between slow and fast trials. In walking, the 3rd and particularly the 4th toe exhibited notable variation in load distribution with minor claw participation only at push-off. Running trials yielded a distinctly triangular load distribution pattern defined by the 4th toe tip, the proximal part of the 3rd toe and the claw tip, with the sharp point of the claw providing an essential traction element at push-off. Consistency of CoP trajectory and load distribution at higher speeds arises from dynamic stability effects and may also reflect stringent limitations to degrees of freedom in hindlimb joint articulation that contribute to locomotor efficiency. This novel research could aid in the reconstruction of theropod locomotor modes and offers a systemic approach for future avian pedobarographic investigations."},{"title":"Social thermoregulation and torpor in the Siberian hamster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1100","abstract":"Social thermoregulation and huddling bring about energy benefits to animals sharing a nest because of the smaller surface-to-volume ratio of a huddle and the higher local temperature in the nest. We tested whether living in groups and huddling affect daily torpor, metabolic rate and seasonal changes in the body mass of a small heterothermic rodent, the Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus), housed under semi-natural conditions both singly and in groups of four litter-mates. We predicted that in hamsters housed in groups: (1) synchronized torpor bouts would be longer and deeper than non-synchronized ones but shallower than in solitary hamsters, (2) seasonal variations in metabolic rate would be lower than in solitary hamsters, and (3) the winter decrease in body mass would be smaller in grouped than in singly housed hamsters. We found that group housing led to a smaller decrease in body mass in winter, and affected the length and depth of daily torpor. In group-living hamsters more than 50% of all torpor episodes were synchronized and torpid animals were often found in huddles formed of all cage-mates. The longest and deepest torpor bouts in groups were recorded when all animals in a group entered torpor simultaneously. Although the minimum body temperature during torpor was higher, torpor duration was slightly longer than in solitary hamsters. We did not record significant differences in the body mass-adjusted rate of oxygen consumption between solitary and grouped animals, either in the cold or at the lower critical temperature. We conclude that social thermoregulation enables maintenance of a larger body mass, and thus a larger body fat content, which can ensure better body condition at the beginning of the reproductive season."},{"title":"Rainbow trout myocardium does not exhibit a slow inotropic response to stretch","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1118","abstract":"Mammalian myocardial studies reveal a biphasic increase in the force of contraction due to stretch. The first rapid response, known as the Frank-Starling response, occurs within one heartbeat of stretch. A second positive inotropic response occurs over the minutes following the initial stretch and is known as the slow force response (SFR). The SFR has been observed in mammalian isolated whole hearts, muscle preparations and individual myocytes. We present the first direct study into the SFR in the heart of a non-mammalian vertebrate, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We stretched ventricular trabecular muscle preparations from 88% to 98% of their optimal length and individual ventricular myocytes by 7% of their slack sarcomere length (SL). Stretch caused an immediate increase in force in both preparations, indicative of the Frank-Starling response. However, we found no significant effect of prolonged stretch on the force of contraction in either the ventricular trabecular preparations or the single myocytes. This indicates that rainbow trout ventricular myocardium does not exhibit a SFR and that, in contrast to mammals, the piscine Frank-Starling response may not be associated with the SFR. We speculate that this is due to the fish myocardium modulating cardiac output via changes in stroke volume to a larger extent than heart rate."},{"title":"Pressure tolerance of the shallow-water caridean shrimp Palaemonetes varians across its thermal tolerance window","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1109","abstract":"To date, no published study has assessed the full physiological scope of a marine invertebrate species with respect to both temperature and hydrostatic pressure.

The rate of oxygen consumption and behaviour in response to varying temperature/pressure combinations were assessed. Rates of oxygen consumption were primarily affected by temperature. Low rates of oxygen consumption were observed at 5 and 10°C across all pressures and were not statistically distinct (P=0.639). From 10 to 30°C, the rate of oxygen consumption increased with temperature; this increase was statistically significant (P<0.001). Palaemonetes varians showed an increasing sensitivity to pressure with decreasing temperature; however, shrimp were capable of tolerating hydrostatic pressures found outside their normal bathymetric distribution at all temperatures. ‘Loss of equilibrium’ (LOE) in ≥50% of individuals was observed at 11 MPa at 5°C, 15 MPa at 10°C, 20 MPa at 20°C and 21 MPa at 30°C. From 5 to 20°C, mean levels of LOE decreased with temperature; this was significant (P<0.001). Low mean levels of LOE were observed at 20 and 30°C and were not distinct (P=0.985).

Our results show a two cluster organization of the six measured variables: one cluster includes glutathione peroxidase in both red blood cells and plasma, thiol concentration in red blood cells and plasma hydroperoxides; the other cluster comprises a measure of the non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity in red blood cells and plasma. The interaction network amongst these variables shows (i) a strong positive connectivity among hydroperoxides, glutathione peroxidase and thiols, and (ii) negative connectivity between non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants.

Although most bats separate pulse and echo in time by signalling at low duty cycles (LDCs), almost 20% of species produce calls at high duty cycles (HDCs) and separate pulse and echo in frequency. HDC echolocators are sensitive to Doppler shifts. HDC echolocation is well suited to detecting fluttering targets such as flying insects against a cluttered background. We used two complementary experiments to evaluate the relative effectiveness of LDC and HDC echolocation for detecting fluttering prey. We measured echoes from fluttering targets by broadcasting artificial bat calls, and found that echo amplitude was greatest for sounds similar to those used in HDC echolocation. We also collected field recordings of syntopic LDC and HDC bats approaching an insect-like fluttering target and found that HDC bats approached the target more often (18.6% of passes) than LDC bats (1.2% of passes). Our results suggest that some echolocation call characteristics, particularly duty cycle and pulse duration, translate into improved ability to detect fluttering targets in clutter, and that HDC echolocation confers a superior ability to detect fluttering prey in the forest understory compared with LDC echolocation. The prevalence of moths in the diets of HDC bats, which is often used as support for the allotonic frequency hypothesis, can therefore be partly explained by the better flutter detection ability of HDC bats."},{"title":"Aerial audiograms of several California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) measured using single and multiple simultaneous auditory steady-state response methods","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1138","abstract":"Measurements of the electrophysiological auditory steady-state response (ASSR) have proven to be efficient for evaluating hearing sensitivity in odontocete cetaceans.

There were no significant differences between thresholds measured using the single and multiple ASSR methods, despite the more rapid nature of data collection using the multiple ASSR method. There was a high degree of variability in ASSR thresholds among subjects; thresholds covered a range of ∼40 dB at each tested frequency. As expected, ASSR thresholds were elevated relative to previously reported psychophysical thresholds for California and Steller sea lions. The features of high-frequency hearing limit and relative sensitivity of most ASSR audiograms were, however, similar to those of psychophysical audiograms, suggesting that ASSR methods can be used to improve understanding of hearing demographics in sea lions, especially with respect to high-frequency hearing.

Mosquitoes are equipped with two pumping organs located in the head: the cibarial (CP) and the pharyngeal (PP) pumps. To analyze the functional relationship of these pumps during the blood-sucking process, micro-particle image velocimetry (PIV) and synchrotron X-ray micro-imaging were employed. The two pumps were found to be well coordinated with a phase shift (α) and time shift (β) but to have distinct functions in the liquid-sucking process. The first pump (CP) starts to expand first, and then the second pump (PP) expands in advance with a time shift (β) before the first pump (CP) begins to contract, playing a key role in improving pumping performance. The systaltic motion of the two pumps works systematically in a well-coordinated manner. In addition, the pumping performance of blood-sucking female mosquitoes is demonstrated to be superior to that of nectar-eating male mosquitoes. Intake flow rate is maximized by reducing the relaxation time of the CP and increasing the pumping frequency."},{"title":"Hydrodynamic stability of the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta): effects of four-limbed rowing versus forelimb flapping in rigid-bodied tetrapods","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1153","abstract":"Hydrodynamic stability is the ability to resist recoil motions of the body produced by destabilizing forces. Previous studies have suggested that recoil motions can decrease locomotor performance, efficiency and sensory perception and that swimming animals might utilize kinematic strategies or possess morphological adaptations that reduce recoil motions and produce more stable trajectories. We used high-speed video to assess hydrodynamic stability during rectilinear swimming in the freshwater painted turtle (Chrysemys picta). Parameters of vertical stability (heave and pitch) were non-cyclic and variable, whereas measures of lateral stability (sideslip and yaw) showed repeatable cyclic patterns. In addition, because freshwater and marine turtles use different swimming styles, we tested the effects of propulsive mode on hydrodynamic stability during rectilinear swimming, by comparing our data from painted turtles with previously collected data from two species of marine turtle (Caretta caretta and Chelonia mydas). Painted turtles had higher levels of stability than both species of marine turtle for six of the eight parameters tested, highlighting potential disadvantages associated with ‘aquatic flight’. Finally, available data on hydrodynamic stability of other rigid-bodied vertebrates indicate that turtles are less stable than boxfish and pufferfish."},{"title":"Stimulus predictability mediates a switch in locomotor smooth pursuit performance for Eigenmannia virescens","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1170","abstract":"The weakly electric glass knifefish, Eigenmannia virescens, will swim forward and backward, using propulsion from an anal ribbon fin, in response to motion of a computer-controlled moving refuge. Fish were recorded performing a refuge-tracking behavior for sinusoidal (predictable) and sum-of-sines (pseudo-random) refuge trajectories. For all trials, we observed high coherence between refuge and fish trajectories, suggesting linearity of the tracking dynamics. But superposition failed: we observed categorical differences in tracking between the predictable single-sine stimuli and the unpredictable sum-of-sines stimuli. This nonlinearity suggests a stimulus-mediated adaptation. At all frequencies tested, fish demonstrated reduced tracking error when tracking single-sine trajectories and this was typically accompanied by a reduction in overall movement. Most notably, fish demonstrated reduced phase lag when tracking single-sine trajectories. These data support the hypothesis that fish generate an internal dynamical model of the stimulus motion, hence improving tracking of predictable trajectories (relative to unpredictable ones) despite similar or reduced motor cost. Similar predictive mechanisms based on the dynamics of stimulus movement have been proposed recently, but almost exclusively for nonlocomotor tasks by humans, such as oculomotor target tracking and posture control. These data suggest that such mechanisms might be common across taxa and behaviors."},{"title":"Comparison of volatile blends and gene sequences of two isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae of different virulence and repellency toward the termite Macrotermes michaelseni","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/956","abstract":"Previously, we reported an interesting relationship between virulence and repellency of different isolates of the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae towards the termite Macrotermes michaelseni: the higher the virulence of a given isolate, the greater its repellency. In the present study, we compared the volatile profiles of two isolates, one that was more virulent (and repellent) and one that was less virulent (and repellent) to the termite. The prominent components of the two blends were characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and authenticated by gas chromatography coinjections with synthentic standards. There were both qualitative and quantitative differences between the two blends. The repellencies of synthetic blends of 10 prominent constituents of the volatiles of the two isolates were compared and that of the more virulent isolate was found to be significantly more repellent. Subtractive bioassays were carried out with one of the constituents of each of the two 10-component blends missing at a time to determine its relative contribution to the overall repellency. The results indicated that the repellency of the volatiles of each isolate was primarily due to synergistic effects of a smaller number of constituents. Intraspecific differences between the two isolates were also reflected in their nucleotide sequences."},{"title":"Escaping the flow: boundary layer use by the darter Etheostoma tetrazonum (Percidae) during benthic station holding","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1181","abstract":"Aquatic habitats characterized by directional water flow (lotic environments) pose numerous challenges to their inhabitants, including the constant threat of dislodgement and downstream transport. As a result, many organisms exhibit morphological and/or behavioral adaptations that facilitate midwater or benthic station holding in these environments, such as the ventral sucker disc of armored catfishes. However, a few groups, including the species-rich group of small (7-8 cm long and 1-2 cm high) North American stream fishes called darters, exhibit no obvious morphological adaptations to life in lotic habitats. We therefore asked whether small size itself facilitates benthic station holding in these fish. We first used digital particle image velocimetry to quantify the fluid dynamics of flow over a variety of substrates. We then visualized the patterns of flow over the darter Etheostoma tetrazonum during benthic station holding. The thickness of the region of decreased water velocity (i.e. the boundary layer) associated with several types of rocky substrate was large enough (∼2 cm high in some cases) for E. tetrazonum and many other darter species to escape the oncoming flow. We also found that, despite the large size of its pectoral fins, E. tetrazonum is capable of producing only very weak negative lift forces with fins. These substrate-directed forces likely act in conjunction with upstream-directed frictional forces between the tail, anal and pelvic fins and the substrate to facilitate station holding. Thus, we hypothesize that, in darters, small size is an adaptation to life in the benthic boundary layer of lotic environments."},{"title":"Scaling of caterpillar body properties and its biomechanical implications for the use of a hydrostatic skeleton","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1194","abstract":"Caterpillars can increase their body mass 10,000-fold in 2 weeks. It is therefore remarkable that most caterpillars appear to maintain the same locomotion kinematics throughout their entire larval stage. This study examined how the body properties of a caterpillar might change to accommodate such dramatic changes in body load. Using Manduca sexta as a model system, we measured changes in body volume, tissue density and baseline body pressure, and the dimensions of load-bearing tissues (the cuticle and muscles) over a body mass range from milligrams to several grams. All Manduca biometrics relevant to the hydrostatic skeleton scaled allometrically but close to the isometric predictions. Body density and pressure were almost constant. We next investigated the effects of scaling on the bending stiffness of the caterpillar hydrostatic skeleton. The anisotropic non-linear mechanical response of Manduca muscles and soft cuticle has previously been quantified and modeled with constitutive equations. Using biometric data and these material laws, we constructed finite element models to simulate a hydrostatic skeleton under different conditions. The results show that increasing the internal pressure leads to a non-linear increase in bending stiffness. Increasing the body size results in a decrease in the normalized bending stiffness. Muscle activation can double this stiffness in the physiological pressure range, but thickening the cuticle or increasing the muscle area reduces the structural stiffness. These non-linear effects may dictate the effectiveness of a hydrostatic skeleton at different sizes. Given the shared anatomy and size variation in Lepidoptera larvae, these mechanical scaling constraints may implicate the diverse locomotion strategies in different species."},{"title":"The sub-lethal effects of repeated freezing in the woolly bear caterpillar Pyrrharctia isabella","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/7/1205","abstract":"Repeated freeze–thaw cycles are common and are increasing in frequency with climate change in many temperate locations, yet understanding of their impact on freeze-tolerant insects is extremely limited. We investigated the effects of repeated freezing and thawing on the freeze-tolerant final instar caterpillars of the moth Pyrrharctia isabella (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) by subjecting individuals to either a single sustained 35 h freeze or five 7 h freezes. Sub-lethal effects were quantified with changes in three broad groups of measures: (1) cold hardiness, (2) metabolic rate and energy reserves and (3) survival after challenge with fungal spores. Repeated freeze–thaw cycles increased mortality to almost 30% and increased tissue damage in Malpighian tubules and hemocytes. Repeated freezing increased caterpillar glycerol concentration by 0.82 mol l–1. There were no changes in metabolic rate or energy reserves with repeated freezing. For the first time, we report increased survival after immune challenge in caterpillars after freezing and suggest that this may be linked to wounding during freezing. We suggest that little repair of freezing damage is possible in P. isabella caterpillars and repeated freeze–thaw cycles may present significant challenges to survival in this species."},{"title":"Regulation of heart rate and rumen temperature in red deer: effects of season and food intake","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/963","abstract":"Red deer, Cervus elaphus, like other temperate-zone\n                    animals, show a large seasonal fluctuation in energy intake and expenditure.\n                    Many seasonal phenotypic adjustments are coordinated by endogenous signals\n                    entrained to the photoperiod.

In addition to\n                    an apparently endogenous down-regulation of heart rate in winter, the deer\n                    further reduced heart rate over about 8 days in response to food restriction. We\n                    found a strong correlation between rumen temperature and seasonal or periodic\n                    variation in heart rate.

Although it is becoming increasingly clear that different behavioral states are associated with different profiles of brain gene expression, it is not known whether this relationship extends to states that are as dynamic and specific as those associated with foraging-related spatiotemporal memories. We tested this hypothesis by training different groups of foragers from the same colony to collect sucrose solution from one of two artificial feeders; each feeder was in a different location and had sucrose available at a different time, either in the morning or afternoon. Bees from both training groups were collected at both the morning and afternoon training times to result in one set of bees that was undergoing stereotypical food anticipatory behavior and another that was inactive for each time of day. Between the two groups with the different spatiotemporal memories, microarray analysis revealed that 1329 genes were differentially expressed in the brains of honey bees. Many of these genes also varied with time of day, time of training or state of food anticipation. Some of these genes are known to be involved in a variety of biological processes, including metabolism and behavior. These results indicate that distinct spatiotemporal foraging memories in honey bees are associated with distinct neurogenomic signatures, and the decomposition of these signatures into sets of genes that are also influenced by time or activity state hints at the modular composition of this complex neurogenomic phenotype."},{"title":"Changes in plasma melatonin levels and pineal organ melatonin synthesis following acclimation of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to different water salinities","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/928","abstract":"Melatonin has been suggested to play a role in fish osmoregulation, and in salmonids has been related to the timing of adaptive mechanisms during smolting. It has been described that acclimation to different environmental salinities alters levels of circulating melatonin in a number of fish species, including rainbow trout. However, nothing is known regarding salinity effects on melatonin synthesis in the pineal organ, which is the main source of rhythmically produced and secreted melatonin in blood. In the present study we have evaluated, in rainbow trout, the effects of acclimation to different salinities on day and night plasma melatonin values and pineal organ melatonin synthesis. Groups of freshwater (FW)-adapted rainbow trout were placed in tanks with four different levels of water salinity (FW, 6, 12, 18 p.p.t.; parts per thousand) and maintained for 6 h or 5 days. Melatonin content in plasma and pineal organs, as well as the pineal content of serotonin (5-HT) and its main oxidative metabolite (5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid; 5-HIAA) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. In addition, day–night changes in pineal organ arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT2) activity and aanat2 gene expression were studied. Plasma osmolalities were found to be higher in rainbow trout exposed to all salinity levels compared with the control FW groups. A salinity-dependent increase in melatonin content was found in both plasma and pineal organs. This effect was observed during the night, and was related to an increase in aanat2 mRNA abundance and AANAT2 enzyme activity, both of which also occurred during the day. Also, the levels of indoles (5-HT, 5-HIAA) in the pineal organ were negatively affected by increasing water salinity, which seems to be related to the higher recruitment of 5-HT as a substrate for the increased melatonin synthesis. A stimulatory effect of salinity on pineal aanat2 mRNA expression was also identified. These results indicate that increased external salinity promotes melatonin synthesis in the pineal organ of rainbow trout by enhancing synthesis of AANAT protein independently of its regulation by light. The possibility that pineal melatonin is a target for hormones involved in the response of fish to osmotic challenge is discussed, as well as the potential role of melatonin in the timing of osmoregulatory processes."},{"title":"Expression of multidrug resistance proteins is localized principally to the Malpighian tubules in larvae of the cabbage looper moth, Trichoplusia ni","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/937","abstract":"The multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) serve a number of important roles in development, physiological homeostasis and metabolic resistance.

To investigate their contribution to xenobiotic resistance, we have examined the tissue distribution of gene and protein expression of the multidrug resistance proteins TrnMRP1 and TrnMRP4 of the lepidopteran insect, Trichoplusia ni. Using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry, we have identified high expression levels of both transporters in the Malpighian tubules relative to levels in other major tissues of the body, where they probably contribute to excretion of metabolic wastes or ingested xenobiotics. We have specifically located TrnMRP protein expression in a subpopulation of Malpighian tubule secondary cells. Expression of TrnMRP1 was also detected both at a high level in specific cortical neurons of larval ganglia and at a lower level throughout the cortex, where it may act in signaling or protective functions, respectively. In contrast, expression of TrnMRP4 was low to absent in larval ganglia, with the exception of single cells in the central connective. We discuss the potential implications of this TrnMRP activity on insect development and metabolic resistance."},{"title":"Live CT imaging of sound reception anatomy and hearing measurements in the pygmy killer whale, Feresa attenuata","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/945","abstract":"In June 2008, two pygmy killer whales (Feresa attenuata) were stranded alive near Boca Grande, FL, USA, and were taken into rehabilitation. We used this opportunity to learn about the peripheral anatomy of the auditory system and hearing sensitivity of these rare toothed whales. Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of head structures from X-ray computed tomography (CT) images revealed mandibles that were hollow, lacked a bony lamina medial to the pan bone and contained mandibular fat bodies that extended caudally and abutted the tympanoperiotic complex. Using auditory evoked potential (AEP) procedures, the modulation rate transfer function was determined. Maximum evoked potential responses occurred at modulation frequencies of 500 and 1000 Hz. The AEP-derived audiograms were U-shaped. The lowest hearing thresholds occurred between 20 and 60 kHz, with the best hearing sensitivity at 40 kHz. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) was composed of seven waves and resembled the ABR of the bottlenose and common dolphins. By changing electrode locations, creating 3-D reconstructions of the brain from CT images and measuring the amplitude of the ABR waves, we provided evidence that the neuroanatomical sources of ABR waves I, IV and VI were the auditory nerve, inferior colliculus and the medial geniculate body, respectively. The combination of AEP testing and CT imaging provided a new synthesis of methods for studying the auditory system of cetaceans."},{"title":"Neural circuit activity in freely behaving zebrafish (Danio rerio)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/1028","abstract":"Examining neuronal network activity in freely behaving animals is advantageous for probing the function of the vertebrate central nervous system. Here, we describe a simple, robust technique for monitoring the activity of neural circuits in unfettered, freely behaving zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish respond to unexpected tactile stimuli with short- or long-latency escape behaviors, which are mediated by distinct neural circuits. Using dipole electrodes immersed in the aquarium, we measured electric field potentials generated in muscle during short- and long-latency escapes. We found that activation of the underlying neural circuits produced unique field potential signatures that are easily recognized and can be repeatedly monitored. In conjunction with behavioral analysis, we used this technique to track changes in the pattern of circuit activation during the first week of development in animals whose trigeminal sensory neurons were unilaterally ablated. One day post-ablation, the frequency of short- and long-latency responses was significantly lower on the ablated side than on the intact side. Three days post-ablation, a significant fraction of escapes evoked by stimuli on the ablated side was improperly executed, with the animal turning towards rather than away from the stimulus. However, the overall response rate remained low. Seven days post-ablation, the frequency of escapes increased dramatically and the percentage of improperly executed escapes declined. Our results demonstrate that trigeminal ablation results in rapid reconfiguration of the escape circuitry, with reinnervation by new sensory neurons and adaptive changes in behavior. This technique is valuable for probing the activity, development, plasticity and regeneration of neural circuits under natural conditions."},{"title":"Geometric analysis of macronutrient selection in the adult domestic\n                    cat, Felis catus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/1039","abstract":"We report feeding studies on adult domestic cats designed to disentangle\n                    the complex interactions among dietary protein, fat and carbohydrate in the\n                    control of intake.

Limits to SusEI during peak lactation may be imposed peripherally by the capacity of mammary glands to produce milk or may be driven by the ability of animals to dissipate body heat. To distinguish between the two mechanisms, body mass change, food intake, reproductive output (using litter size and mass) and serum prolactin (PRL) levels were measured in striped hamsters lactating at 23, 30 and 5°C. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) during late lactation was also measured. Female hamsters lactating at 5°C showed significantly lower change in body mass, but had higher food intake and RMR than females at 23 and 30°C. Asymptotic food intake averaged 14.6±0.4, 14.5±0.7 and 16.2±0.5 g d–1 for females at 23, 30 and 5°C, respectively. The females at 5°C had 11.4% higher asymptotic food intake than females at 23 and 30°C (F2,51=3.3, P<0.05, Tukey's HSD, P<0.05).

These data suggested that females lactating at cold temperatures increased food intake to compensate for additional energy demands for thermogenesis, but they might not be capable of exporting more energy as milk to the pups, indicating a possible consistency with the peripheral hypothesis. However, the present results do not considerably distinguish the peripheral limitation hypothesis from the heat dissipation limits hypothesis."},{"title":"The influence of environmental calcium concentrations on calcium flux, compensatory drinking and epithelial calcium channel expression in a freshwater cartilaginous fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/996","abstract":"Calcium metabolism and mRNA levels of the epithelial calcium channel (ECaC) were examined in a freshwater cartilaginous fish, the lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens.

Net calcium flux was inward in all treatment groups; however, calcium influx was greatest in the low calcium environment and lowest in the high calcium environment, whereas efflux had the opposite relationship. A significant difference in the concentration of 45Ca in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of fish in the low calcium environment led to the examination of drinking rate and calcium flux across the anterior-middle (mid) intestine. Drinking rate was not different between treatments; however, calcium influx across the mid-intestine in the low calcium treatment was significantly greater than that in both the normal and high calcium treatments. The lake sturgeon ECaC was 2831 bp in length, with a predicted protein sequence of 683 amino acids that shared a 66% identity with the closest sequenced ECaCs from the vertebrate phyla. ECaC mRNA levels were examined in the gills, kidney, pyloric caeca, mid-intestine and spiral intestine. Expression levels were highest in the gills, then the kidneys, and were orders of magnitude lower in the GIT. Contrary to existing models for calcium uptake in the teleost gill, ECaC expression was greatest in high calcium conditions and kidney ECaC expression was lowest in low calcium conditions, suggesting that cellular transport mechanisms for calcium may be distinctly different in these freshwater cartilaginous fishes."},{"title":"Effect of slope and sciatic nerve injury on ankle muscle recruitment and hindlimb kinematics during walking in the rat","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/1007","abstract":"Slope-related differences in hindlimb movements and activation of the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles were studied during treadmill locomotion in intact rats and in rats 4 and 10 weeks following transection and surgical repair of the sciatic nerve. In intact rats, the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles were activated reciprocally at all slopes, and the overall intensity of activity in tibialis anterior and the mid-step activity in soleus increased with increasing slope. Based on the results of principal components analysis, the pattern of activation of soleus, but not of tibialis anterior, changed significantly with slope. Slope-related differences in hindlimb kinematics were found in intact rats, and these correlated well with the demands of walking up or down slopes. Following recovery from sciatic nerve injury, the soleus and tibialis anterior were co-activated throughout much of the step cycle and there was no difference in intensity or pattern of activation with slope for either muscle. Unlike intact rats, these animals walked with their feet flat on the treadmill belt through most of the stance phase. Even so, during downslope walking limb length and limb orientation throughout the step cycle were not significantly changed from values found in intact rats. This conservation of hindlimb kinematics was not observed during level or upslope walking. These findings are interpreted as evidence that the recovering animals adopt a novel locomotor strategy that involves stiffening of the ankle joint by antagonist co-activation and compensation at more proximal joints. Their movements are most suitable to the requirements of downslope walking but the recovering rats lack the ability to adapt to the demands of level or upslope walking."},{"title":"Burrow extension with a proboscis: mechanics of burrowing by the glycerid Hemipodus simplex","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/1017","abstract":"Burrowing marine infauna are morphologically diverse and ecologically important as ecosystem engineers. The polychaetes Nereis virens and Cirriformia moorei extend their burrows by crack propagation. Nereis virens does so by everting its pharynx and C. moorei, lacking an eversible pharynx or proboscis, uses its hydrostatic skeleton to expand its anterior. Both behaviors apply stress to the burrow wall that is amplified at the tip of the crack, which extends by fracture. That two species with such distinct morphologies and life histories both burrow by fracturing sediment suggests that this mechanism may be widespread among burrowers. We tested this hypothesis with the glycerid polychaete Hemipodus simplex, which has an eversible proboscis that is much longer and everts more rapidly than the pharynx of N. virens. When the proboscis is fully everted, the tip flares out wider than the rest of the proboscis, creating a shape and applying a stress distribution similar to that of N. virens and resulting in relatively large forces near the tip of the crack. These forces are larger than necessary to extend the crack by fracture and are surprisingly uncorrelated with the resulting stress amplification at the crack tip, which is also larger than necessary to extend the burrow by fracture. These large forces may plastically deform the mud, allowing the worm to build a semi-permanent burrow. Our results illustrate that similar mechanisms of burrowing are used by morphologically different burrowers."},{"title":"Temperature gradients in the flight muscles of Manduca sexta imply a spatial gradient in muscle force and energy output","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/894","abstract":"There is a significant dorso-ventral temperature gradient in the dominant flight muscles [dorsolongitudinal muscles (DLM1)] of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta during tethered flight.

As force generation in muscle depends on temperature, the mechanical energy output of more dorsal subunits will differ from that of deeper and warmer muscle subunits. To test this hypothesis, we isolated the dorsal subunits and the ventral subunits and recorded both single and 25 Hz (wingbeat frequency) isometric contractions at a range of temperatures. Our data show that the contractile dynamics of the various regions of the DLM1 are similarly affected by temperature, with higher temperatures leading to reduced contraction times. Furthermore, using standard electromyography, we showed that the different regions are activated nearly simultaneously (mean time difference=0.22 ms). These observations suggest that the existence of a temperature gradient will necessarily produce a mechanical energy gradient in the DLM1 in M. sexta."},{"title":"Effects of body mass on physiological and anatomical parameters of mature salmon: evidence against a universal heart rate scaling exponent","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/887","abstract":"The influence of body mass (Mb) on the physiology of large, adult fish is poorly understood, in part because of the logistical difficulties of studying large individuals. For the first time, this study quantified the influence of Mb on the resting heart rate (fH), blood properties and organ masses of adults of a large-growing fish species, the Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Surgically implanted biologgers measured fH and acceleration activity in sexually mature, male fish ranging in Mb from 2.7 to 16.8 kg while they roamed freely in a controlled water body at ∼8°C. Blood parameters (at surgery and at death) and body organ masses (at death) were measured to investigate interrelationships with Mb. The scaling exponents for both fH and acceleration activity were not significantly different from zero. The lack of scaling of fH with Mb contrasts with the situation for birds and mammals. All blood parameters were independent of Mb, while the masses of the compact myocardium, ventricle and spleen each scaled near-isometrically with Mb. These data raise the possibility that blood oxygen carrying capacity, mass-specific cardiac output and cardiac power output are maintained across Mb in adult Chinook salmon. Biologging and biotelemetry should advance investigations into the effects of Mb on the physiology and behaviour of large fish, where current knowledge lags far behind that of birds and mammals."},{"title":"Ocelli contribute to the encoding of celestial compass information in the Australian desert ant Melophorus bagoti","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/901","abstract":"Many animal species, including some social hymenoptera, use the visual system for navigation. Although the insect compound eyes have been well studied, less is known about the second visual system in some insects, the ocelli. Here we demonstrate navigational functions of the ocelli in the visually guided Australian desert ant Melophorus bagoti. These ants are known to rely on both visual landmark learning and path integration. We conducted experiments to reveal the role of ocelli in the perception and use of celestial compass information and landmark guidance. Ants with directional information from their path integration system were tested with covered compound eyes and open ocelli on an unfamiliar test field where only celestial compass cues were available for homing. These full-vector ants, using only their ocelli for visual information, oriented significantly towards the fictive nest on the test field, indicating the use of celestial compass information that is presumably based on polarised skylight, the sun's position or the colour gradient of the sky. Ants without any directional information from their path-integration system (zero-vector) were tested, also with covered compound eyes and open ocelli, on a familiar training field where they have to use the surrounding panorama to home. These ants failed to orient significantly in the homeward direction. Together, our results demonstrated that M. bagoti could perceive and process celestial compass information for directional orientation with their ocelli. In contrast, the ocelli do not seem to contribute to terrestrial landmark-based navigation in M. bagoti."},{"title":"Non-wetting wings and legs of the cranefly aided by fine structures of the cuticle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/915","abstract":"Non-wetting surfaces are imperative to the survival of terrestrial and semi-aquatic insects as they afford resistance to wetting by rain and other liquid surfaces that insects may encounter. Thus, there is an evolutionary pay-off for these insects to adopt hydrophobic technologies, especially on contacting surfaces such as legs and wings. The cranefly is a weak flier, with many species typically found in wet/moist environments where they lay eggs. Water droplets placed on this insect's wings will spontaneously roll off the surface. In addition, the insect can stand on water bodies without its legs penetrating the water surface. The legs and wings of this insect possess thousands of tiny hairs with intricate surface topographies comprising a series of ridges running longitudinally along the long axis of the hair fibre. Here we demonstrate that this fine hair structure enhances the ability of the hairs to resist penetration into water bodies."},{"title":"Identification of erythroid progenitors induced by erythropoietic activity in Xenopus laevis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/921","abstract":"Oxygen is essential for the survival of animals. Red blood cells in the circulation, i.e. peripheral erythrocytes, are responsible for transporting oxygen to tissues. The regulation of erythropoiesis in vertebrates other than mammals is yet to be elucidated. Recently we identified erythropoietin, a primary regulator of erythropoiesis, in Xenopus laevis, which should enable us to identify target cells, including erythroid progenitors, and to investigate the production and development of erythroid cells in amphibians. Here, we established a semi-solid colony-forming assay in Xenopus laevis to clarify the existence of colony-forming unit-erythroid cells, the functional erythroid progenitors identified in vitro. Using this assay, we showed that recombinant xlEPO induces erythroid colony formation in vitro and detected an increased level of erythropoietin activity in blood serum during acute anemic stress. In addition, our study demonstrated the possible presence of multiple, non-xlEPO, factors in anemic serum supportive of erythroid colony formation. These results indicate that erythropoiesis mediated by erythropoietin is present in amphibian species and, furthermore, that the regulatory mechanisms controlling peripheral erythrocyte number may vary among vertebrates."},{"title":"CRF and urotensin I effects on aggression and anxiety-like behavior in rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/907","abstract":"Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is central in the stress response but also modulates several behaviors including anxiety-related behaviors and aggression. In this study, juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were tested for competitive ability, determined during dyadic fights for dominance, after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of CRF, urotensin I (UI), the non-specific CRF antagonist α-helical RF9-41 (ahCRF) or the CRF receptor subtype 1-specific antagonist antalarmin, when paired with a mass-matched con-specific injected with saline. In addition, isolated fish received the same substances. Plasma cortisol and brain monoamines were monitored in all fish. Most fish receiving CRF showed a conspicuous behavior consisting of flaring the opercula, opening the mouth and violent shaking of the head from side to side. When this occurred, the fish immediately forfeited the fight. Similar behavior was observed in most fish receiving UI but no effect on outcome of dyadic fights was noted. This behavior seems similar to non-ambulatory motor activity seen in rats and could be anxiety related. Furthermore, fish receiving CRF at a dose of 1000 ng became subordinate, whereas all other treatments had no effects on the outcome of dyadic fights. In addition, isolated fish receiving ahCRF had lower brain stem concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, serotonin, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and dopamine. In conclusion, CRF seems to attenuate competitive ability, and both CRF and UI seem to induce anxiety-like behavior."},{"title":"The effects of salinity and temperature on the transparency of the grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/709","abstract":"Transparency is an effective form of camouflage, but it must be present throughout the entire volume of an animal to succeed. Certain environmental stressors may cause physiological responses that increase internal light scattering, making tissue less transparent and more conspicuous to predators. We tested this in the transparent grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio, which is found in shallow estuaries where both salinity and temperature change rapidly because of tidal cycles, evaporation and runoff. Animals originally kept at a salinity of 15 p.p.t. and a temperature of 20°C were placed into solutions with salinities of 0, 15, 25 or 30 p.p.t. and temperatures of 13, 20 or 27°C for 12 h (N=26 for each of 12 treatments). Under the control conditions of 15 p.p.t. at 20°C, the transparency of grass shrimp tails was 54±3% (mean ± s.e.). At higher salinities and at both higher and lower temperatures, transparency dropped significantly (P<0.001, two-way ANOVA), reaching 0.04±0.01% at 30 p.p.t. at 27°C. Confocal microscopy of P. pugio's tail suggested that the observed loss of transparency was due to the pooling of low refractive index hemolymph between the high index muscle fibers, creating many index boundaries that increased light scattering. Analysis of a year-long salinity and temperature record from a North Carolina estuary showed that changes of the order of those found in this study are relatively common, suggesting that P. pugio may undergo periods of reduced crypsis, potentially leading to increased predation."},{"title":"Ontogeny of lift and drag production in ground birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/717","abstract":"The juvenile period is often a crucial interval for selective pressure on locomotor ability. Although flight is central to avian biology, little is known about factors that limit flight performance during development. To improve understanding of flight ontogeny, we used a propeller (revolving wing) model to test how wing shape and feather structure influence aerodynamic performance during development in the precocial chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar, 4 to >100 days post hatching). We spun wings in mid-downstroke posture and measured lift (L) and drag (D) using a force plate upon which the propeller assembly was mounted. Our findings demonstrate a clear relationship between feather morphology and aerodynamic performance. Independent of size and velocity, older wings with stiffer and more asymmetrical feathers, high numbers of barbicels and a high degree of overlap between barbules generate greater L and L:D ratios than younger wings with flexible, relatively symmetrical and less cohesive feathers. The gradual transition from immature feathers and drag-based performance to more mature feathers and lift-based performance appears to coincide with ontogenetic transitions in locomotor capacity. Younger birds engage in behaviors that require little aerodynamic force and that allow D to contribute to weight support, whereas older birds may expand their behavioral repertoire by flapping with higher tip velocities and generating greater L. Incipient wings are, therefore, uniquely but immediately functional and provide flight-incapable juveniles with access to three-dimensional environments and refugia. Such access may have conferred selective advantages to theropods with protowings during the evolution of avian flight."},{"title":"The role of the gut in insect chilling injury: cold-induced disruption of osmoregulation in the fall field cricket, Gryllus pennsylvanicus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/726","abstract":"To predict the effects of changing climates on insect distribution and abundance, a clear understanding of the mechanisms that underlie critical thermal limits is required. In insects, the loss of muscle function and onset of cold-induced injury has previously been correlated with a loss of muscle resting potential. To determine the cause of this loss of function, we measured the effects of cold exposure on ion and water homeostasis in muscle tissue, hemolymph and the alimentary canal of the fall field cricket, Gryllus pennsylvanicus, during an exposure to 0°C that caused chilling injury and death. Low temperature exposure had little effect on muscle osmotic balance but it dissipated muscle ion equilibrium potentials through interactions between the hemolymph and gut. Hemolymph volume declined by 84% during cold exposure whereas gut water content rose in a comparable manner. This rise in water content was driven by a failure to maintain osmotic equilibrium across the gut wall, which resulted in considerable migration of Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ into the alimentary canal during cold exposure. This loss of homeostasis is likely to be a primary mechanism driving the cold-induced loss of muscle excitability and progression of chilling injury in chill-susceptible insect species."},{"title":"Estimation of musculoskeletal models from in situ measurements of muscle action in the rat hindlimb","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/735","abstract":"Musculoskeletal models are often created by making detailed anatomical measurements of muscle properties. These measurements can then be used to determine the parameters of canonical models of muscle action. We describe here a complementary approach for developing and validating muscle models, using in situ measurements of muscle actions. We characterized the actions of two rat hindlimb muscles: the gracilis posticus (GRp) and the posterior head of biceps femoris (BFp; excluding the anterior head with vertebral origin). The GRp is a relatively simple muscle, with a circumscribed origin and insertion. The BFp is more complex, with an insertion distributed along the tibia. We measured the six-dimensional isometric forces and moments at the ankle evoked from stimulating each muscle at a range of limb configurations. The variation of forces and moments across the workspace provides a succinct characterization of muscle action. We then used this data to create a simple muscle model with a single point insertion and origin. The model parameters were optimized to best explain the observed force–moment data. This model explained the relatively simple muscle, GRp, very well (R2>0.85). Surprisingly, this simple model was also able to explain the action of the BFp, despite its greater complexity (R2>0.84). We then compared the actions observed here with those predicted using recently published anatomical measurements. Although the forces and moments predicted for the GRp were very similar to those observed here, the predictions for the BFp differed. These results show the potential utility of the approach described here for the development and refinement of musculoskeletal models based on in situ measurements of muscle actions."},{"title":"Behavioural evidence for a sleep-like quiescent state in a pulmonate mollusc, Lymnaea stagnalis (Linnaeus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/747","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine whether the great pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, expresses a sleep-like behavioural state. We found that snails spontaneously enter a relatively brief (22±1 min) quiescent state characterized by postural relaxation of the foot, mantle and tentacles, and cessation of radula rasping. Quiescence was reversed (‘aroused’) by appetitive (sucrose solution) and aversive (tactile) stimuli. Responsiveness to both stimuli was significantly lower in quiescent snails than in active snails. However, tactile stimuli evoked a more sustained defensive response in quiescent snails. Quiescence bouts were consolidated into ‘clusters’ over an infradian timescale and were only weakly affected by time of day. Clusters contained 7±0.5 bouts, lasted 13±1 h and were separated by long (37±4 h) intervals of almost continuous activity. Analysis of Kaplan–Meier survival curves revealed that the quiescent bout duration was described by an exponential probability distribution (time constant 15±1 min). Active bout duration was described by a bi-exponential probability distribution (time constants 62±4 and 592±48 min). We found no evidence for a ‘sleep rebound’ mechanism and quiescence expression appeared to be regulated through stochastic processes causing state transitions to resemble a Markovian random walk. We conclude that Lymnaea is a potentially valuable model system for studies of cellular function in sleep."},{"title":"Using double-stranded RNA to explore the role of heat shock protein genes in heat tolerance in Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/764","abstract":"The whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) biotype B, is one of the most destructive invasive pests of field and glasshouse crops, and has a high tolerance to heat. Our previous work found that whitefly females are more heat tolerant than males. In the present study, real-time PCR and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) methods were used to explore the role of heat shock protein (Hsp) genes in whitefly of both sexes; this provided further evidence of the mechanism underlying the differential heat tolerance abilities of females and males. The results showed that both hsp23 and hsp70 mRNA expression levels were higher in females than in males from 37.5 to 42°C, while at the extreme temperature of 44°C the hsp70 mRNA level was higher in males than in females. There was no significant difference in hsp90 mRNA expression between females and males under heat shock conditions. Furthermore, the survival rate of females fed hsp23 or hsp70 dsRNA significantly decreased following heat shock at 44°C for 1 h, but male survival rate was not significantly affected. Additionally, the survival rate of both females and males showed no significant change after they were fed with hsp90 dsRNA. Collectively, the present study shows that the optimum mRNA expression of Hsp genes in females promotes a higher survival rate under heat shock conditions; hsp23 and hsp70 play a key role for heat tolerance in females but not in males, and hsp90 shows no significant role in heat tolerance in either females or males. Further, our study indicates that feeding with dsRNA is an effective method by which to study gene function, and the simplicity of this approach opens the way for further research on gene function in different sexes and diverse groups of species."},{"title":"Evidence of a central pattern generator regulating spermathecal muscle activity in Locusta migratoria and its coordination with oviposition","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/757","abstract":"Electrophysiological recordings were conducted to determine the control of spermathecal contractions during oviposition of interrupted egg-laying locusts, Locusta migratoria. Following transection of the central nervous system below the metathoracic ganglion, rhythmic patterned bursting was detected by extracellular recordings of the nerve N2B2 that innervates the muscles of the spermatheca. Subsequent transections at more posterior regions of the ventral nerve cord revealed more robust rhythmic bursting in N2B2. This rhythmic bursting pattern was found to be coordinated with bursting in the ventral opener nerve (N2B1) that innervates the ventral opener muscle. This muscle controls the ventral ovipositor valves. Electromyographic recordings from the spermathecal muscle and ventral opener muscle confirmed a rhythmic bursting pattern resulting in an increase in muscle activity. Taken together, the results indicate that there is probably a central pattern generator (CPG), which is regulated by descending inhibition, that controls the spermathecal muscle activity. This CPG appears to be located within the VIIth and VIIIth abdominal ganglia, and was found to integrate with the CPG that regulates oviposition digging in locusts. These results provide further insight into the intricate coordination and control of reproductive tissues underlying reproductive behaviours in locusts."},{"title":"Mechanical filtering for narrow-band hearing in the weta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/778","abstract":"This paper constitutes a major attempt to associate tympanic deflections with the mechanoreceptor organ location in an acoustic insect. The New Zealand tree weta (Hemideina thoracica) has tympanal ears located on each of the prothoracic tibiae. The tympana exhibit a sclerotized oval plate, membranous processes bulging out from the tibial cuticle and many loosely suspended ripples. We used microscanning laser Doppler vibrometry to determine how such a tympanal membrane vibrates in response to sound and whether the sclerotized region plays a role in hearing. The tympanum displays a single resonance at the calling frequency of the male, an unusual example of an insect tympana acting as a narrow bandpass filter. Both tympana resonate in phase with the stimulus and with each other. Histological sections show that the tympanal area is divided into two distinct regions, as in other ensiferans. An oval plate lies in the middle of a thickened region and is surrounded by a transparent and uniformly thin region. It is hinged dorsally to the tympanal rim and thus resembles the model of a ‘hinged flap’. The thickened region appears to act as a damping mass on the oscillation of the thin region, and vibration displacement is reduced in this area. The thinner area vibrates with higher amplitude, inducing mechanical pressure on the dorsal area adjacent to the crista acustica. We present a new model showing how the thickened region might confer a mechanical gain onto the activation of the crista acustica sensory neurons during the sound-induced oscillations."},{"title":"Twilight spectral dynamics and the coral reef invertebrate spawning response","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/770","abstract":"There are dramatic and physiologically relevant changes in both skylight color and intensity during evening twilight as the pathlength of direct sunlight through the atmosphere increases, ozone increasingly absorbs long wavelengths and skylight becomes increasingly blue shifted. The moon is above the horizon at sunset during the waxing phase of the lunar cycle, on the horizon at sunset on the night of the full moon and below the horizon during the waning phase. Moonlight is red shifted compared with daylight, so the presence, phase and position of the moon in the sky could modulate the blue shifts during twilight. Therefore, the influence of the moon on twilight color is likely to differ somewhat each night of the lunar cycle, and to vary especially rapidly around the full moon, as the moon transitions from above to below the horizon during twilight. Many important light-mediated biological processes occur during twilight, and this lunar effect may play a role. One particularly intriguing biological event tightly correlated with these twilight processes is the occurrence of mass spawning events on coral reefs. Therefore, we measured downwelling underwater hyperspectral irradiance on a coral reef during twilight for several nights before and after the full moon. We demonstrate that shifts in twilight color and intensity on nights both within and between evenings, immediately before and after the full moon, are correlated with the observed times of synchronized mass spawning, and that these optical phenomena are a biologically plausible cue for the synchronization of these mass spawning events."},{"title":"Climbing flight performance and load carrying in lesser dog-faced fruit bats (Cynopterus brachyotis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/786","abstract":"The metabolic cost of flight increases with mass, so animals that fly tend to exhibit morphological traits that reduce body weight. However, all flying animals must sometimes fly while carrying loads. Load carrying is especially relevant for bats, which experience nightly and seasonal fluctuations in body mass of 40% or more. In this study, we examined how the climbing flight performance of fruit bats (Cynopterus brachyotis; N=4) was affected by added loads. The body weights of animals were experimentally increased by 0, 7, 14 or 21% by means of intra-peritoneal injections of saline solution, and flights were recorded as animals flew upwards in a small enclosure. Using a model based on actuator disk theory, we estimated the mechanical power expended by the bats as they flew and separated that cost into different components, including the estimated costs of hovering, climbing and increasing kinetic energy. We found that even our most heavily loaded bats were capable of upward flight, but as the magnitude of the load increased, flight performance diminished. Although the cost of flight increased with loading, bats did not vary total induced power across loading treatment. This resulted in a diminished vertical velocity and thus shallower climbing angle with increased loads. Among trials there was considerable variation in power production, and those with greater power production tended to exhibit higher wingbeat frequencies and lower wing stroke amplitudes than trials with lower power production. Changes in stroke plane angle, downstroke wingtip velocity and wing extension did not correlate significantly with changes in power output. We thus observed the manner in which bats modulated power output through changes in kinematics and conclude that the bats in our study did not respond to increases in loading with increased power output because their typical kinematics already resulted in sufficient aerodynamic power to accommodate even a 21% increase in body weight."},{"title":"Environmental complexity, seasonality and brain cell proliferation in a weakly electric fish, Brachyhypopomus gauderio","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/794","abstract":"Environmental complexity and season both influence brain cell proliferation in adult vertebrates, but their relative importance and interaction have not been directly assessed. We examined brain cell proliferation during both the breeding and non-breeding seasons in adult male electric fish, Brachyhypopomus gauderio, exposed to three environments that differed in complexity: (1) a complex natural habitat in northern Uruguay, (2) an enriched captive environment where fish were housed socially and (3) a simple laboratory setting where fish were isolated. We injected fish with BrdU 2.5 h before sacrifice to label newborn cells. We examined the hindbrain and midbrain and quantified the density of BrdU+ cells in whole transverse sections, proliferative zones and two brain nuclei in the electrocommunication circuitry (the pacemaker nucleus and the electrosensory lateral line lobe). Season had the largest effect on cell proliferation, with fish during the breeding season having three to seven times more BrdU+ cells than those during the non-breeding season. Although the effect was smaller, fish from a natural environment had greater rates of cell proliferation than fish in social or isolated captive environments. For most brain regions, fish in social and isolated captive environments had equivalent levels of cell proliferation. However, for brain regions in the electrocommunication circuitry, group-housed fish had more cell proliferation than isolated fish, but only during the breeding season (season × environment interaction). The regionally and seasonally specific effect of social environment on cell proliferation suggests that addition of new cells to these nuclei may contribute to seasonal changes in electrocommunication behavior."},{"title":"Multimodal signal variation in space and time: how important is matching a signal with its signaler?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/815","abstract":"Multimodal signals (acoustic+visual) are known to be used by many anuran amphibians during courtship displays. The relative degree to which each signal component influences female mate choice, however, remains poorly understood. In this study we used a robotic frog with an inflating vocal sac and acoustic playbacks to document responses of female túngara frogs to unimodal signal components (acoustic and visual). We then tested female responses to a synchronous multimodal signal. Finally, we tested the influence of spatial and temporal variation between signal components for female attraction. Females failed to approach the isolated visual cue of the robotic frog and they showed a significant preference for the call over the spatially separate robotic frog. When presented with a call that was temporally synchronous with the vocal sac inflation of the robotic frog, females did not show a significant preference for this over the call alone; when presented with a call that was temporally asynchronous with vocal sac inflation of the robotic frog, females discriminated strongly against the asynchronous multimodal signal in favor of the call alone. Our data suggest that although the visual cue is neither necessary nor sufficient for attraction, it can strongly modulate mate choice if females perceive a temporal disjunction relative to the primary acoustic signal."},{"title":"Survival and energetic costs of repeated cold exposure in the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica: a comparison between frozen and supercooled larvae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/806","abstract":"In this study, we examined the effects of repeated cold exposure (RCE) on the survival, energy content and stress protein expression of larvae of the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica (Diptera: Chironomidae). Additionally, we compared results between larvae that were frozen at –5°C in the presence of water during RCE and those that were supercooled at –5°C in a dry environment. Although >95% of larvae survived a single 12 h bout of freezing at –5°C, after five cycles of RCE survival of frozen larvae dropped below 70%. Meanwhile, the survival of control and supercooled larvae was unchanged, remaining around 90% for the duration of the study. At the tissue level, frozen larvae had higher rates of cell mortality in the midgut than control and supercooled larvae. Furthermore, larvae that were frozen during RCE experienced a dramatic reduction in energy reserves; after five cycles, frozen larvae had 25% less lipid, 30% less glycogen and nearly 40% less trehalose than supercooled larvae. Finally, larvae that were frozen during RCE had higher expression of hsp70 than those that were supercooled, indicating a higher degree of protein damage in the frozen group. Results were similar between larvae that had accumulated 60 h of freezing at –5°C over five cycles of RCE and those that were frozen continuously for 60 h, suggesting that the total time spent frozen determines the physiological response. Our results suggest that it is preferable, both from a survival and energetic standpoint, for larvae to seek dry microhabitats where they can avoid inoculative freezing and remain unfrozen during RCE."},{"title":"Coping with novelty and stress in free-living house sparrows","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/821","abstract":"Individuals respond differently to stressors and it has been suggested that stress responses are related to coping styles (consistent individual differences in behavior and physiology). We studied behavioral responses to a novel object and corticosterone response to stress during chick rearing in free-living female house sparrows (Passer domesticus). To prevent mates from influencing each others' behavior, we removed the males temporarily from nests and tested the females the following day either with a novel object placed on the nest box or as control. The two groups differed only in behaviors that were a priori defined as responses to the novel object (latency to first feeding, time spent near the nest, and inspecting the novel object by hovering in front of it) indicating that mate-removal per se had no effect on female behavior. Based on these variables, females' coping behaviors were categorized as ‘bold’, ‘inquisitive’ or ‘shy’ by discriminant analysis. Baseline corticosterone, measured on the day following the novel-object or control test, was not related to any measure of coping. Stress-induced corticosterone, however, was negatively related to number of hoverings in front of the nest (a measure of explorativeness) and accordingly differed between the behavioral coping categories, with ‘inquisitive’ birds having the lowest stress response. We propose that the relationship between physiological stress response and behavioral response to novelty (a component of personality or coping style) may be more complex than previously suggested, and individuals cannot always be unambiguously categorized along a single personality axis."},{"title":"Understanding the energetic costs of living in saline environments: effects of salinity on basal metabolic rate, body mass and daily energy consumption of a long-distance migratory shorebird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/829","abstract":"Many migratory vertebrates typically move between habitats with varying salinities during the annual cycle. These organisms clearly exhibit a remarkable phenotypic flexibility in their ‘osmoregulatory machinery’, but the metabolic consequences of salinity acclimatization are still not well understood. We investigated the effects of salinity on basal metabolic rate (BMR), body mass and daily energy consumption of a long-distance migratory shorebird, the dunlin (Calidris alpina), outside the breeding season. Mass-corrected BMR and daily energy consumption increased significantly by 17 and 20% between freshwater (0.3‰ NaCl) and saltwater (33.0–35.0‰ NaCl), respectively. Body mass in both captive and wild dunlins was lower (9–16%) in saline than in freshwater environments. These changes on BMR and body mass were quickly reversed by returning the birds to freshwater, suggesting that metabolic adjustment to saltwater and metabolic readjustment to freshwater are both processes that occur in a few days. Our findings support empirically that the processes of developing and maintaining an active osmoregulatory machinery are energetically expensive, and they could help to explain diet and/or habitat selection patterns along the flyway. Finally, we discuss whether body mass loss in saltwater may be a strategy to reduce maintenance cost in osmotically stressful conditions such as overwintering in marine habitats, and raise some methodological implications for studies of BMR-related outcomes using captive birds captured in saline environments."},{"title":"Biomechanics of jumping in the flea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/836","abstract":"It has long been established that fleas jump by storing and releasing energy in a cuticular spring, but it is not known how forces from that spring are transmitted to the ground. One hypothesis is that the recoil of the spring pushes the trochanter onto the ground, thereby generating the jump. A second hypothesis is that the recoil of the spring acts through a lever system to push the tibia and tarsus onto the ground. To decide which of these two hypotheses is correct, we built a kinetic model to simulate the different possible velocities and accelerations produced by each proposed process and compared those simulations with the kinematics measured from high-speed images of natural jumping. The in vivo velocity and acceleration kinematics are consistent with the model that directs ground forces through the tibia and tarsus. Moreover, in some natural jumps there was no contact between the trochanter and the ground. There were also no observable differences between the kinematics of jumps that began with the trochanter on the ground and jumps that did not. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the tibia and tarsus have spines appropriate for applying forces to the ground, whereas no such structures were seen on the trochanter. Based on these observations, we discount the hypothesis that fleas use their trochantera to apply forces to the ground and conclude that fleas jump by applying forces to the ground through the end of the tibiae."},{"title":"Resting and action potentials under hypotonic conditions, unlike Na+ pump activity, depend only on the alteration of intracellular [Na+] and [K+] in frog skeletal muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/858","abstract":"It is well established that hypotonicity generates a marked and unexpected increase in active Na+ efflux in frog muscle fibers as well as in other cells like cardiac myocytes, astrocytes, brain synaptosomes and renal cells.

Kinocilia play a crucial role in transmitting movement of the overlying mass, otoconial membrane or cupula to the mechanotransducing portion of the hair cell bundle. Little is known regarding the mechanical deformation properties of the kinocilium. Using a force-deflection technique, we measured two important mechanical properties of kinocilia in the utricle of a turtle, Trachemys (Pseudemys) scripta elegans. First, we measured the stiffness of kinocilia with different heights. These kinocilia were assumed to be homogenous cylindrical rods and were modeled as both isotropic Euler–Bernoulli beams and transversely isotropic Timoshenko beams. Two mechanical properties of the kinocilia were derived from the beam analysis: flexural rigidity (EI) and shear rigidity (kGA). The Timoshenko model produced a better fit to the experimental data, predicting EI=10,400 pN μm2 and kGA=247 pN. Assuming a homogenous rod, the shear modulus (G=1.9 kPa) was four orders of magnitude less than Young's modulus (E=14.1 MPa), indicating that significant shear deformation occurs within deflected kinocilia. When analyzed as an Euler–Bernoulli beam, which neglects translational shear, EI increased linearly with kinocilium height, giving underestimates of EI for shorter kinocilia. Second, we measured the rotational stiffness of the kinocilium insertion (κ) into the hair cell's apical surface. Following BAPTA treatment to break the kinocilial links, the kinocilia remained upright, and κ was measured as 177±47 pN μm rad–1. The mechanical parameters we quantified are important for understanding how forces arising from head movement are transduced and encoded by hair cells."},{"title":"The protective role of aquaporins in the freeze-tolerant insect Eurosta solidaginis: functional characterization and tissue abundance of EsAQP1","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/5/848","abstract":"The movement of water and small solutes is integral to the survival of freezing and desiccation in insects, yet the underlying mechanisms of these processes are not fully known.

Our study sequenced, functionally characterized and measured the tissue abundance of an AQP from freeze-tolerant larvae of the gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae). The newly characterized EsAQP1 contains two NPA motifs and six transmembrane regions, and is phylogenetically related to an AQP from the anhydrobiotic chironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki. Using a Xenopus laevis oocyte swelling assay, we demonstrated that EsAQP1 increases water permeability to nine times that of simple diffusion through the membrane. In contrast to its high water permeability, EsAQP1 was impermeable to both glycerol and urea. The abundance of EsAQP1 increased from October to December in all tissues tested and was most abundant in the brain of winter larvae. Because the nervous system is thought to be the primary site of freezing injury, EsAQP1 may cryoprotect the brain from damage associated with water imbalance. The sequence, phylogenetic relationship, osmotic permeability, tissue distribution and seasonal abundance of EsAQP1 further support the role of AQPs in promoting freezing tolerance."},{"title":"Underwater and surface behavior of homing juvenile northern elephant seals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/629","abstract":"Northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris, travel between colonies along the west coast of North America and foraging areas in the North Pacific. They also have the ability to return to their home colony after being experimentally translocated. However, the mechanisms of this navigation are not known. Visual information could serve an important role in navigation, either primary or supplementary. We examined the role of visual cues in elephant seal navigation by translocating three seals and recording their heading direction continuously using GPS, and acceleration and geomagnetic data loggers while they returned to the colony. The seals first reached the coast and then proceeded to the colony by swimming along the coast. While underwater the animals exhibited a horizontally straight course (mean net-to-gross displacement ratio=0.94±0.02). In contrast, while at the surface they changed their headings up to 360 deg. These results are consistent with the use of visual cues for navigation to the colony. The seals may visually orient by using landmarks as they swim along the coast. We further assessed whether the seals could maintain a consistent heading while underwater during drift dives where one might expect that passive spiraling during drift dives could cause disorientation. However, seals were able to maintain the initial course heading even while underwater during drift dives where there was spiral motion (to within 20 deg). This behavior may imply the use of non-visual cues such as acoustic signals or magnetic fields for underwater orientation."},{"title":"Ordinary glomeruli in the antennal lobe of male and female tortricid moth Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) process sex pheromone and host-plant volatiles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/637","abstract":"Both sexes of Grapholita molesta, a key pest of stone fruits, are able to detect host-plant volatiles and the sex pheromone emitted by females, and to modify their behaviour accordingly. How olfactory information is processed in the central nervous system is unknown. Intracellular recordings and stainings were used to characterize antennal lobe (AL) neuron responses to single pheromone components, a behaviourally active blend of five peach volatiles and a pear-fruit ester. AL neurons with different response patterns responded to pheromone components and plant volatiles. In males more neurons responded specifically to the main pheromone component than in females, whereas neurons responding to all three pheromone components were more abundant in females. Neurons responding to all three pheromone components often responded also to the tested plant volatiles in both sexes. Responses to all pheromone components were dose dependent in males and females, but dose–response relationships differed between neurons and tested pheromone components. Among the five AL projection neurons identified neuroanatomically in males, no arborizations were observed in the enlarged cumulus (Cu), although all of them responded to pheromone compounds. In one of two stained projection neurons in females, however, the glomerulus, which is thought to be homologous to the Cu, was targeted. The processing of pheromone information by ordinary glomeruli rather than by the macroglomerular complex is thus a striking feature of this species, indicating that pheromone and plant volatile processing are not entirely separate in this tortricid moth AL. However, the absence of recorded pheromone responses in the Cu needs to be confirmed."},{"title":"N-dimensional animal energetic niches clarify behavioural options in a variable marine environment","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/646","abstract":"Animals respond to environmental variation by exhibiting a number of different behaviours and/or rates of activity, which result in corresponding variation in energy expenditure. Successful animals generally maximize efficiency or rate of energy gain through foraging. Quantification of all features that modulate energy expenditure can theoretically be modelled as an animal energetic niche or power envelope; with total power being represented by the vertical axis and n-dimensional horizontal axes representing extents of processes that affect energy expenditure. Such an energetic niche could be used to assess the energetic consequences of animals adopting particular behaviours under various environmental conditions. This value of this approach was tested by constructing a simple mechanistic energetics model based on data collected from recording devices deployed on 41 free-living Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), foraging from four different colonies in Argentina and consequently catching four different types of prey. Energy expenditure was calculated as a function of total distance swum underwater (horizontal axis 1) and maximum depth reached (horizontal axis 2). The resultant power envelope was invariant, irrespective of colony location, but penguins from the different colonies tended to use different areas of the envelope. The different colony solutions appeared to represent particular behavioural options for exploiting the available prey and demonstrate how penguins respond to environmental circumstance (prey distribution), the energetic consequences that this has for them, and how this affects the balance of energy acquisition through foraging and expenditure strategy."},{"title":"Locomotory transition from water to sand and its effects on undulatory kinematics in sand lances (Ammodytidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/657","abstract":"Sand lances, fishes in the genus Ammodytes, exhibit a peculiar burrowing behavior in which they appear to swim rapidly into the substrate. They use posteriorly propagated undulations of the body to move in both water, a Newtonian fluid, and in sand, a non-Newtonian, granular substrate. In typical aquatic limbless locomotion, undulations of the body push against water, which flows because it is incapable of supporting the static stresses exerted by the animal, thus the undulations move in world space (slipping wave locomotion). In typical terrestrial limbless locomotion, these undulations push against substrate irregularities and move relatively little in world space (non-slipping wave locomotion). We used standard and X-ray video to determine the roles of slipping wave and non-slipping wave locomotion during burrowing in sand lances. We find that sand lances in water use slipping wave locomotion, similar to most aquatic undulators, but switch to non-slipping waves once they burrow. We identify a progression of three stages in the burrowing process: first, aquatic undulations similar to typical anguilliform locomotion (but without head yaw) push the head into the sand; second, more pronounced undulations of the aquatic portion of the body push most of the animal below ground; third, the remaining above-ground portion of the body ceases undulation and the subterranean portion takes over, transitioning to non-slipping wave locomotion. We find no evidence that sand lances use their body motions to fluidize the sand. Instead, as soon as enough of the body is underground, they undergo a kinematic shift and locomote like terrestrial limbless vertebrates."},{"title":"Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae) tick salivary gland serine protease inhibitor (serpin) 6 is secreted into tick saliva during tick feeding","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/665","abstract":"In order to successfully feed and transmit disease agents, ticks are thought to inject serine protease inhibitors (serpins) into the host to modulate host defense responses to tick feeding, such as inflammation, the complement activation pathway and blood coagulation. In this study, we show that Amblyomma americanum (Aam) serpin (S) 6 is putatively injected into the host during tick feeding, in that the antibody to recombinant (r) AamS6 specifically reacted with the expected ∼43/45 kDa AamS6 protein band on western blots of pilocarpine-induced tick saliva. Additionally, antibodies to tick saliva proteins that were generated by repeated 48 h infestations of rabbits with adult A. americanum specifically reacted with rAamS6. We speculate that AamS6 is associated with regulating events at the start of the tick feeding process, as temporal and spatial RT-PCR and western blot analyses revealed that both AamS6 mRNA and protein are strongly expressed during the first 24–72 h of feeding time before starting to fade from 96 h. The AamS6 protein has an apparently slow turnover rate in that, although the injection of AamS6 dsRNA into unfed ticks triggered complete disruption of the AamS6 mRNA by the 48 h feeding time point, western blot analysis of protein extracts of the same animals showed that the AamS6 protein that may have been expressed prior to disruption of the AamS6 mRNA was not depleted. We speculate that the presence of the AamS6 protein in ticks despite the complete disruption of the AamS6 mRNA explains the observation that RNAi-mediated silencing of the AamS6 mRNA did not affect the ability of A. americanum ticks to attach onto host skin, successfully feed and lay eggs. These findings are discussed in regards to advances in the molecular biology of ticks."},{"title":"Muscle damage and muscle remodeling: no pain, no gain?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/674","abstract":"Skeletal muscle is a dynamic tissue that responds adaptively to both the nature and intensity of muscle use. This phenotypic plasticity ensures that muscle structure is linked to patterns of muscle use throughout the lifetime of an animal. The cascade of events that result in muscle restructuring – for example, in response to resistance exercise training – is often thought to be initiated by muscle damage. We designed this study to test the hypothesis that symptomatic (i.e. detectable) damage is a necessary precursor for muscle remodeling. Subjects were divided into two experimental populations: pre-trained (PT) and naive (NA). Demonstrable muscle damage was avoided in the PT group by a three-week gradual ‘ramp-up’ protocol. By contrast, the NA group was subjected to an initial damaging bout of exercise. Both groups participated in an eight-week high-force eccentric-cycle ergometry program (20 min, three times per week) designed to equate the total work done during training between the groups. The NA group experienced signs of damage, absent in the PT group, as indicated by greater than five times higher levels of plasma creatine kinase (CK) and self-reporting of initial perceived soreness and exertion, yet muscle size and strength gains were not different for the two groups. RT-PCR analysis revealed similar increases in levels of the growth factor IGF-1Ea mRNA in both groups. Likewise, the significant (P<0.01) increases in mean cross-sectional area (and total muscle volume) were equal in both groups. Finally, strength increases were identical for both groups (PT=25% and NA=26% improvement). The results of this study suggest that muscle rebuilding – for example, hypertrophy – can be initiated independent of any discernible damage to the muscle."},{"title":"Loss of Angiotensin-converting enzyme-related (ACER) peptidase disrupts night-time sleep in adult Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/680","abstract":"Drosophila Acer (Angiotensin-converting enzyme-related) encodes a member of the angiotensin-converting enzyme family of metallopeptidases that have important roles in the endocrine regulation of blood homeostasis in mammals. Acer is expressed in the embryonic heart of Drosophila and expression in the adult head appears to be regulated by two clock genes. To study the role of Acer in development and in circadian activity, we have generated Acer null mutants by imprecise excision of a P-element and have compared their development and circadian behaviour with that of wild-type flies with the same genetic background. We show that Acer is not required for normal development, but that night sleep, which is clock regulated, is disrupted in adult flies lacking ACER. Acer null adults have reduced night-time sleep and greater sleep fragmentation, but normal levels of daytime sleep. The quality of night sleep in flies fed inhibitors of ACER is affected in a very similar manner. We have shown, using specific antibodies, that ACER is present in the adult fat body of the head and abdomen, and is secreted into the haemolymph. ACER might therefore have a role in cleaving regulatory peptides involved in metabolism and activity behaviour. There are similarities with mammals, where ACE peptidases are also expressed in adipose tissue and are thought to be part of a signalling system linking metabolism with sleep."},{"title":"The effect of substrate compliance on the biomechanics of gibbon leaps","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/687","abstract":"The storage and recovery of elastic strain energy in the musculoskeletal systems of locomoting animals has been extensively studied, yet the external environment represents a second potentially useful energy store that has often been neglected. Recent studies have highlighted the ability of orangutans to usefully recover energy from swaying trees to minimise the cost of gap crossing. Although mechanically similar mechanisms have been hypothesised for wild leaping primates, to date no such energy recovery mechanisms have been demonstrated biomechanically in leapers. We used a setup consisting of a forceplate and two high-speed video cameras to conduct a biomechanical analysis of captive gibbons leaping from stiff and compliant poles. We found that the gibbons minimised pole deflection by using different leaping strategies. Two leap types were used: slower orthograde leaps and more rapid pronograde leaps. The slower leaps used a wider hip joint excursion to negate the downward movement of the pole, using more impulse to power the leap, but with no increase in work done on the centre of mass. Greater hip excursion also minimised the effective leap distance during orthograde leaps. The more rapid leaps conversely applied peak force earlier in stance where the pole was effectively stiffer, minimising deflection and potential energy loss. Neither leap type appeared to usefully recover energy from the pole to increase leap performance, but the gibbons demonstrated an ability to best adapt their leap biomechanics to counter the negative effects of the compliant pole."},{"title":"The mechanics of explosive dispersal and self-burial in the seeds of the filaree, Erodium cicutarium (Geraniaceae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/521","abstract":"The filaree (Erodium cicutarium), a small, flowering plant related to geraniums, possesses a unique seed dispersal mechanism: the plant can fling its seeds up to half a meter away; and the seeds can bury themselves by drilling into the ground, twisting and untwisting in response to changes in humidity. These feats are accomplished using awns, helical bristles of dead but hygroscopically active tissue attached to the seeds. Here, we describe the kinematics of explosive dispersal and self-burial based on detailed high-speed and time-lapse videos. We use these observations to develop a simple mechanical model that accounts for the coiling behavior of the awn and allows comparison of the strain energy stored in the awn with the kinetic energy at launch. The model is used to examine tradeoffs between dispersal distance and reliability of the dispersal mechanism. The mechanical model may help in understanding the invasive potential of this species and provides a framework for examining other evolutionary tradeoffs in seed dispersal mechanisms among the Geraniaceae."},{"title":"Locomotor behavior across an environmental transition in the ropefish, Erpetoichthys calabaricus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/530","abstract":"Many amphibious organisms undergo repeated aquatic to terrestrial transitions during their lifetime; limbless, elongate organisms that make such transitions must rely on axial-based locomotion in both habitats. How is the same anatomical structure employed to produce an effective behavior across such disparate habitats? Here, we examine an elongate amphibious fish, the ropefish (Erpetoichthys calabaricus), and ask: (1) how do locomotor movements change during the transition between aquatic and terrestrial environments and (2) do distantly related amphibious fishes demonstrate similar modes of terrestrial locomotion? Ropefish were examined moving in four experimental treatments (in which the water level was to lowered mimic the transition between environments) that varied from fully aquatic to fully terrestrial. Kinematic parameters (lateral excursion, wavelength, amplitude and frequency) were calculated for points along the midline of the body and compared across treatments. Terrestrial locomotion in the ropefish is characterized by long, slow, large-amplitude undulations down the length of the body; in contrast, aquatic locomotion is characterized by short-wavelength, small-amplitude, high-frequency undulations that gradually increase in an anterior to posterior direction. Experimental treatments with intermediate water levels were more similar to aquatic locomotion in that they demonstrated an anterior to posterior pattern of increasing lateral excursion and wave amplitude, but were more similar to terrestrial locomotion with regard to wavelength, which did not change in an anterior to posterior direction. Finally, the ropefish and another elongate amphibious fish, the eel, consistently exhibit movements characterized by ‘path following’ when moving on land, which suggests that elongate fishes exhibit functional convergence during terrestrial locomotion."},{"title":"Colour blindness of the movement-detecting system of the spider Cupiennius salei","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/546","abstract":"The nocturnal wandering spider Cupiennius salei has one pair of principal eyes and three pairs of secondary eyes located on the prosoma, which differ in both morphology and function. Their spectral sensitivity, measured with intracellular recordings, is due to three different types of photoreceptors with absorbance maxima in the mid-range of the spectrum, at 480 nm and 520 nm and in the UV at 360 nm. Based on these physiological data colour vision might be possible. In the present study, the ability to discriminate coloured moving stimuli from grey backgrounds was tested. The perception of moving coloured stripes in front of backgrounds with 29 different grey levels was measured by using extracellular recordings from the anterior median eye muscles as a monitoring system. Each of these eyes has two muscles, which increase their activity when moving stimuli are presented in front of a secondary eye. This variation in eye muscle activity can be recorded extracellulary in a living spider using a single channel telemetry device. If colour perception exists, the animal should be able to detect a moving coloured stripe in front of any grey level. Blue, green and red stripes were used as moving stimuli, in front of all 29 grey backgrounds. The results indicate that C. salei is not able to discriminate the coloured stimuli from distinct shades of grey. It is therefore evident that the movement-detecting system in this spider appears to be colour blind."},{"title":"Stable isotopes of captive cetaceans (killer whales and bottlenose dolphins)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/538","abstract":"There is currently a great deal of interest in using stable isotope methods to investigate diet, trophic level and migration in wild cetaceans. In order to correctly interpret the results stemming from these methods, it is crucial to understand how diet isotopic values are reflected in consumer tissues. In this study, we investigated patterns of isotopic discrimination between diet and blood constituents of two species of cetaceans (killer whale, Orcinus orca, and bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus) fed controlled diets over 308 and 312 days, respectively. Diet discrimination factors (Δ; mean ± s.d.) for plasma were estimated to Δ13C=2.3±0.6‰ and Δ15N=1.8±0.3‰, respectively, for both species and to Δ13C=2.7±0.3‰ and Δ15N=0.5±0.1‰ for red blood cells. Delipidation did not have a significant effect on carbon and nitrogen isotopic values of blood constituents, confirming that cetacean blood does not serve as a reservoir of lipids. In contrast, carbon isotopic values were higher in delipidated samples of blubber, liver and muscle from killer whales. The potential for conflict between fisheries and cetaceans has heightened the need for trophic information about these taxa. These results provide the first published stable isotope incorporation data for cetaceans, which are essential if conclusions are to be drawn on issues concerning trophic structures, carbon sources and diet reconstruction."},{"title":"Physiological flexibility and acclimation to food shortage in a heterothermic primate","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/551","abstract":"As ecosystems undergo changes worldwide, physiological flexibility is likely to be an important adaptive response to increased climate instability. Extreme weather fluctuations impose energetical constraints such as unpredictable food shortage. We tested how grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) could adjust their daily heterothermy and locomotor activity to these ‘energetic accidents’ with a food restriction experiment. The experimental design consisted of acute calorie restriction (2 weeks, 80% restriction) in the middle of winter, after a fattening season with low (11 weeks, 40% restriction) versus high (ad libitum) food availability. This design aimed at simulating the combined effects of the quality of the fattening season (acclimation effect) and a sudden, severe food shortage during the lean season. Hour of start and duration of torpor were the most flexible components of energy savings, increasing in response to the acute food shortage with facilitation by chronic restriction (acclimation effect). Modulations of locomotor activity did not support the hypothesis of energy savings, as total locomotor activity was not reduced. Nonetheless, acutely restricted individuals modified their temporal pattern of locomotor activity according to former food availability. We provide the first experimental evidence of different temporal levels of flexibility of energy-saving mechanisms in a heterotherm exposed to food shortage. The acclimation effect of past food scarcity suggests that heterothermic organisms are better able to respond to unpredicted food scarcity during the lean season. The flexible control of energy expenditure conferred by heterothermy may facilitate the plastic response of heterothermic species to more frequent climatic hazards."},{"title":"Mechanisms underlying rhythmic locomotion: body–fluid interaction in undulatory swimming","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/561","abstract":"Swimming of fish and other animals results from interactions of rhythmic body movements with the surrounding fluid. This paper develops a model for the body–fluid interaction in undulatory swimming of leeches, where the body is represented by a chain of rigid links and the hydrodynamic force model is based on resistive and reactive force theories. The drag and added-mass coefficients for the fluid force model were determined from experimental data of kinematic variables during intact swimming, measured through video recording and image processing. Parameter optimizations to minimize errors in simulated model behaviors revealed that the resistive force is dominant, and a simple static function of relative velocity captures the essence of hydrodynamic forces acting on the body. The model thus developed, together with the experimental kinematic data, allows us to investigate temporal and spatial (along the body) distributions of muscle actuation, body curvature, hydrodynamic thrust and drag, muscle power supply and energy dissipation into the fluid. We have found that: (1) thrust is generated continuously along the body with increasing magnitude toward the tail, (2) drag is nearly constant along the body, (3) muscle actuation waves travel two or three times faster than the body curvature waves and (4) energy for swimming is supplied primarily by the mid-body muscles, transmitted through the body in the form of elastic energy, and dissipated into the water near the tail."},{"title":"Developmental regulation of hemoglobin synthesis in the green anole lizard Anolis carolinensis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/575","abstract":"Tetrapod vertebrates possess multiple α- and β-like globin genes that are ontogenetically regulated, such that functionally distinct hemoglobin (Hb) isoforms are synthesized during different stages of development. The α- and β-like globin genes of amphibians, birds and mammals are differentially expressed during embryonic development and postnatal life, but little is known about the developmental regulation of globin gene expression in non-avian reptiles. Here we report an investigation into the developmental regulation of Hb synthesis in the green anole lizard Anolis carolinensis. We tested two hypotheses derived from comparative genomic studies of the globin gene clusters in tetrapod vertebrates. First, we tested whether the product of the Anolis αD-globin gene is incorporated into embryonic Hb, thereby performing the role that would normally be performed by the embyronic αE-globin gene (which has been deleted from the green anole genome). Second, we tested whether two ‘lizard-specific’ β-globin paralogs have independently evolved a division of labor between an early-expressed embryonic gene and a later-expressed adult gene. Results of a proteomic analysis revealed that α- and β-like globin genes of the anole are differentially expressed during embryonic development. However, the same repertoire of α- and β-chain Hb isoforms was expressed during all stages of development and postnatal life, and the ontogenetic shifts in isoform composition were relatively subtle. In contrast to the pattern that has been documented in other tetrapod vertebrates, it appears that the developmental regulation of Hb synthesis in the green anole lizard does not involve discrete, stage-specific switches in gene activation and gene silencing."},{"title":"Food preferences of Knysna and purple-crested turacos fed varying concentrations of equicaloric and equimolar artificial fruit","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/613","abstract":"The effects that different fruit sugar types and concentrations have on food preferences of avian frugivores have been relatively poorly studied. Although it has been recently advocated that preference is based on equicaloric energy it is also important to note whether preferences change as energy content changes. Therefore, sugar preferences of equicaloric and equimolar artificial fruit of different sugar types at varying concentrations and molarities were investigated in two relatively large South African frugivores, Knysna (Tauraco corythaix) and purple-crested (Gallirex porphyreolophus) turacos. Artificial fruits containing 6.6, 12.4 or 22% sucrose or glucose, and artificial fruits containing 0.42, 0.83 or 1.66 mol l–1 sucrose or glucose, were used to determine sugar preferences. Knysna turacos preferred the sucrose to the glucose equicaloric artificial fruit diet at low concentrations whereas purple-crested turacos showed no preference for either diet. Both turacos species preferred the sucrose equimolar artificial fruit diet to the glucose at low concentrations. At high concentrations neither species showed a preference for either equicaloric or equimolar artificial fruit diets. This suggests that energy requirements influence food preferences more than sugar type and that birds will select fruit that is higher in energy irrespective of sugar type. This complements an earlier study on digestion of differing equicaloric and equimolar artificial fruit sugar types. It again emphasizes the need for future studies looking at the composition of indigenous forest fruit sugars in order to obtain insight into the role of these avian frugivores as potential seed dispersers of fruiting tree species."},{"title":"Olfactory lateralization in homing pigeons: a GPS study on birds released with unilateral olfactory inputs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/593","abstract":"A large body of evidence has shown that pigeons rely on an olfactory-based navigational map when homing from unfamiliar locations. Previous studies on pigeons released with one nostril occluded highlighted an asymmetry in favour of the right nostril, particularly concerning the initial orientation performance of naïve birds. Nevertheless, all pigeons experiencing only unilateral olfactory input showed impaired homing, regardless of the side of the occluded nostril. So far this phenomenon has been documented only by observing the birds' vanishing bearings. In the present work we recorded the flight tracks of pigeons with previous homing experience equipped with a GPS data logger and released from an unfamiliar location with the right or the left nostril occluded. The analysis of the tracks revealed that the flight path of the birds with the right nostril occluded was more tortuous than that of unmanipulated controls. Moreover, the pigeons smelling with the left nostril interrupted their journey significantly more frequently and displayed more exploratory activity than the control birds, e.g. during flights around a stopover site. These data suggest a more important involvement of the right olfactory system in processing the olfactory information needed for the operation of the navigational map."},{"title":"Egg yolk environment differentially influences physiological and morphological development of broiler and layer chicken embryos","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/619","abstract":"Maternal effects are important in epigenetic determination of offspring phenotypes during all life stages. In the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), transgenerational transfer of egg yolk factors may set the stage for morphological and physiological phenotypic differences observed among breeds. To investigate the effect of breed-specific yolk composition on embryonic broiler and layer chicken phenotypes, we employed an ex ovo, xenobiotic technique that allowed the transfer of broiler and layer chicken embryos from their natural yolks to novel yolk environments. Embryonic day two broiler embryos developing on broiler yolk culture medium (YCM) had significantly higher heart rates than layer embryos developing on layer YCM (176±7 beats min–1 and 147±7 beats min–1, respectively). Broiler embryos developing on layer YCM exhibited heart rates typical of layer embryos developing normally on layer YCM. However, layer embryo heart rates were not affected by development on broiler YCM. Unlike O2 consumption, development rate and body mass of embryos were significantly affected by exposure to different yolk types, with both broiler and layer embryos displaying traits that reflected yolk source rather than embryo genotype. Analysis of hormone concentrations of broiler and layer egg yolks revealed that testosterone concentrations were higher in broiler yolk (4.63±2.02 pg mg–1 vs 3.32±1.92 pg mg–1), whereas triiodothyronine concentrations were higher in layer yolk (1.05±0.18 pg mg–1 vs 0.46±0.22 pg mg–1). Thus, a complex synergistic effect of breed-specific genotype and yolk environment exists early in chicken development, with yolk thyroid hormone and yolk testosterone as potential mediators of the physiological and morphological effects."},{"title":"Deconstructing honeybee vitellogenin: novel 40 kDa fragment assigned to its N terminus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/582","abstract":"Vitellogenin, an egg-yolk protein precursor common to oviparous animals, is found abundantly in honeybee workers – a caste of helpers that do not usually lay eggs. Instead, honeybee vitellogenin (180 kDa) participates in processes other than reproduction: it influences hormone signaling, food-related behavior, immunity, stress resistance and longevity. The molecular basis of these functions is largely unknown. Here, we establish and compare the molecular properties of vitellogenin from honeybee hemolymph (blood) and abdominal fat body, two compartments that are linked to vitellogenin functions. Our results reveal a novel 40 kDa vitellogenin fragment in abdominal fat body tissue, the main site for vitellogenin synthesis and storage. Using MALDI-TOF combined with MS/MS mass-spectroscopy, we assign the 40 kDa fragment to the N terminus of vitellogenin, whereas a previously observed 150 kDa fragment corresponded to the remainder of the protein. We show that both protein units are N glycosylated and phosphorylated. Focusing on the novel 40 kDa fragment, we present a homology model based on the structure of lamprey lipovitellin that includes a conserved β-barrel-like shape, with a lipophilic cavity in the interior and two insect-specific loops that have not been described before. Our data indicate that the honeybee fat body vitellogenin experiences cleavage unlike hemolymph vitellogenin, a pattern that can suggest a tissue-specific role. Our experiments advance the molecular understanding of vitellogenin, of which the multiple physiological and behavioral effects in honeybees are well established."},{"title":"Ott's protein osmotic pressure of serum and interstitial fluid in chickens (Gallus gallus): effect of age and gender","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/599","abstract":"Protein, or colloid, osmotic pressure (COP) is of sufficient magnitude to exert a powerful effect on Starling forces across the capillary wall. Although avian skin lacks active mechanisms for fluid transmission, such as sweating, it is now hypothesized that passive oncotic forces may regulate fluid flow and distribution in the skin and related phenomena. In this study, serum protein profiles, as well as COP in serum (COPs) and in suction blister fluid (COPsbf), were determined in juvenile, young and adult female and male chickens. For assessing COP, the Ott-Ahlqvist equation was applied. This equation can formulate the effects of multiple serum proteins on COP, according to their molecular mass. The COP values determined in chickens were lower than those previously found in mammals. COPs increased with age in males, and was higher in adult males than in adult females. In contrast, COPsbf decreased with age in females, although it was better preserved in adult males. The age-dependent decrease in COP was associated with a parallel decrease in the concentration of α1-globulin and albumin, and a positive correlation between packed cell volume (PCV) and COP was found. It is concluded that ageing affects Ott's COP around the vessel wall, and that an oncotic mechanism preserves plasma volume. The preservation of COPsbf in males suggests better maintenance of the interstitial ground substance. Females seem to lose more of a tissue's COPs counteracting force than males, probably as a result of gender-specific changes in the composition of the interstitial matrix. Further studies are required to elucidate the structure and function of avian lymphatics and their role in skin rheology."},{"title":"How might ants use panoramic views for route navigation?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/445","abstract":"Studies of insect navigation have demonstrated that insects possess an interesting and sophisticated repertoire of visual navigation behaviours.

A necessary complement to behavioural studies is an understanding of the sensory ecology within which an animal behaves. To this end we have analysed ants'-perspective views of a habitat within which desert ant navigation is well studied. Results from our analysis suggest that: parsimonious visual strategies for homing and route guidance are effective over behaviourally useful distances even in cluttered environments; that these strategies can function effectively using only the skyline heights as input; and that the simplicity and efficacy of using stored views as a visual compass makes it a viable and robust mechanism for route guidance."},{"title":"Digestive efficiency of Knysna and purple-crested turacos fed varying concentrations of equicaloric and equimolar artificial fruit","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/4/607","abstract":"Avian frugivores have been somewhat poorly studied with regards to the effects that different fruit sugar types and concentrations have on their digestive efficiencies.

Food intake of both turaco species increased with decreasing sugar concentration and molarity, irrespective of sugar type, suggesting compensatory mechanisms for energy requirements. Apparent assimilation efficiencies of both turaco species ranged from 61.4-90.0% and 60.2-92.4% for equicaloric and equimolar artificial fruit diets, respectively. Digestive transit times for both turaco species were slowed with an increase in sugar concentration and molarity, irrespective of sugar type. Consequently these two frugivores appear to be tolerant of sugar type and would be expected to select fruits based on energy yields. Future studies of the composition of indigenous forest fruit sugars may give insight into food preferences of the turaco species and their role as potential seed dispersers of fruiting tree species."},{"title":"Interactions between detoxification mechanisms and excretion in Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/462","abstract":"Insects have long been known to excrete toxins via the Malpighian (renal) tubules. In addition, exposure to natural or synthetic toxins is commonly associated with increases in the activity of detoxification enzymes such as the P450 monoxygenases (P450s) and the glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). We examined the links between mechanisms for detoxification and excretion in adult Drosophila melanogaster using functional assays and measurements of changes in gene expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in response to dietary exposure to compounds known to alter activity or gene expression of P450s and GSTs. Dietary exposure to phenol, which alters gene expression for multiple GSTs after seven to 10 generations, was also associated with an increase (more than twofold) in secretion of the organic anion methotrexate (MTX) by isolated tubules. Dietary exposure to the insecticide synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was associated with reduced expression of two P450 genes (Cyp4e2, Cyp4p1) and two GST genes (GstD1, GstD5) in the tubules, as well as increased expression of Cyp12d1 and GstE1. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of fluid secreted by isolated tubules indicated that dietary exposure to PBO resulted in increased levels of an MTX metabolite. In addition, exposure to PBO altered the expression of transporter genes in the tubules, including a Drosophila multidrug resistance-associated protein, and was associated with a 73% increase in MTX secretion by isolated tubules. The results suggest that exposure of Drosophila to toxins evokes a coordinated response by the Malpighian tubules, involving both alterations in detoxification pathways as well as enhanced transport."},{"title":"Scaling of mechanical power output during burst escape flight in the Corvidae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/452","abstract":"Avian locomotor burst performance (e.g. acceleration, maneuverability) decreases with increasing body size and has significant implications for the survivorship, ecology and evolution of birds. However, the underlying mechanism of this scaling relationship has been elusive. The most cited mechanistic hypothesis posits that wingbeat frequency alone limits maximal muscular mass-specific power output. Because wingbeat frequency decreases with body size, it may explain the often-observed negative scaling of flight performance. To test this hypothesis we recorded in vivo muscular mechanical power from work-loop mechanics using surgically implanted sonomicrometry (measuring muscle length change) and strain gauges (measuring muscle force) in four species of Corvidae performing burst take-off and vertical escape flight. The scale relationships derived for the four species suggest that maximum muscle-mass-specific power scales slightly negatively with pectoralis muscle mass (M–0.18m, 95% CI: –0.42 to 0.05), but less than the scaling of wingbeat frequency (M–0.29m, 95% CI: –0.37 to –0.23). Mean muscle stress was independent of muscle mass (M–0.02m, 95% CI: –0.20 to 0.19), but total muscle strain (percent length change) scaled positively (M0.12m, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.18), which is consistent with previous results from ground birds (Order Galliformes). These empirical results lend minimal support to the power-limiting hypothesis, but also suggest that muscle function changes with size to partially compensate for detrimental effects of size on power output, even within closely related species. Nevertheless, additional data for other taxa are needed to substantiate these scaling patterns."},{"title":"Honey bee forager thoracic temperature inside the nest is tuned to broad-scale differences in recruitment motivation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/469","abstract":"Insects that regulate flight muscle temperatures serve as crucial pollinators in a broad range of ecosystems, in part because they forage over a wide span of temperatures. Honey bees are a classic example and maintain their thoracic muscles at temperatures (Tth) tuned to the caloric benefits of floral resources. Using infrared thermography, we tested the hypothesis that forager motivation to recruit nestmates for a food source is positively correlated with Tth. We trained bees to a sucrose feeder located 5–100 m from the nest. Recruiting foragers had a significantly higher average Tth (2.7°C higher) when returning from 2.5 mol l–1 sucrose (65% w/w) than when returning from 1.0 mol l–1 sucrose (31% w/w). Foragers exhibited significantly larger thermal fluctuations the longer they spent inside the nest between foraging trips. The difference between maximum and minimum temperatures during a nest visit (Trange) increased with total duration of the nest visit (0.7°C increase per additional min spent inside the nest). Bees that recruited nestmates (waggle or round danced) were significantly warmer, with a 1.4–1.5 times higher ΔTth (difference between Tth and nest ambient air temperature) than bees who tremble danced or simply walked on the nest floor without recruiting between foraging bouts. However, recruiter Tth was not correlated with finer-scale measures of motivation: the number of waggle dance circuits or waggle dance return phase duration. These results support the hypothesis that forager Tth within the nest is correlated to broad-scale differences in foraging motivation."},{"title":"Propulsion efficiency and imposed flow fields of a copepod jump","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/476","abstract":"Pelagic copepods jump to relocate, to attack prey and to escape predators. However, there is a price to be paid for these jumps in terms of their energy costs and the hydrodynamic signals they generate to rheotactic predators. Using observed kinematics of various types of jumps, we computed the imposed flow fields and associated energetics of jumps by means of computational fluid dynamics simulations by modeling the copepod as a self-propelled body. The computational fluid dynamics simulation was validated by particle image velocimetry data. The flow field generated by a repositioning jump quickly evolves into two counter-rotating viscous vortex rings that are near mirror image of one another, one in the wake and one around the body of the copepod; this near symmetrical flow may provide hydrodynamic camouflage because it contains no information about the position of the copepod prey within the flow structure. The flow field associated with an escape jump sequence also includes two dominant vortex structures: one leading wake vortex generated as a result of the first jump and one around the body, but between these two vortex structures is an elongated, long-lasting flow trail with flow velocity vectors pointing towards the copepod; such a flow field may inform the predator of the whereabouts of the escaping copepod prey. High Froude propulsion efficiency (0.94–0.98) was obtained for individual power stroke durations of all simulated jumps. This is unusual for small aquatic organisms but is caused by the rapidity and impulsiveness of the jump that allows only a low-cost viscous wake vortex to travel backwards."},{"title":"Color vision and learning in the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (Nymphalidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/509","abstract":"The monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, is well known for its intimate association with milkweed plants and its incredible multi-generational trans-continental migrations. However, little is known about monarch butterflies' color perception or learning ability, despite the importance of visual information to butterfly behavior in the contexts of nectar foraging, host-plant location and mate recognition. We used both theoretical and experimental approaches to address basic questions about monarch color vision and learning ability. Color space modeling based on the three known spectral classes of photoreceptors present in the eye suggests that monarchs should not be able to discriminate between long wavelength colors without making use of a dark orange lateral filtering pigment distributed heterogeneously in the eye. In the context of nectar foraging, monarchs show strong innate preferences, rapidly learn to associate colors with sugar rewards and learn non-innately preferred colors as quickly and proficiently as they do innately preferred colors. Butterflies also demonstrate asymmetric confusion between specific pairs of colors, which is likely a function of stimulus brightness. Monarchs readily learn to associate a second color with reward, and in general, learning parameters do not vary with temporal sequence of training. In addition, monarchs have true color vision; that is, they can discriminate colors on the basis of wavelength, independent of intensity. Finally, behavioral trials confirm that monarchs do make use of lateral filtering pigments to enhance long-wavelength discrimination. Our results demonstrate that monarchs are proficient and flexible color learners; these capabilities should allow them to respond rapidly to changing nectar availabilities as they travel over migratory routes, across both space and time."},{"title":"A latitudinal cline in the efficacy of endogenous signals: evidence derived from retinal cone contraction in fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/501","abstract":"Like many physiological systems synchronised to the light:dark cycle, retinomotor movements in ‘lower’ vertebrates are controlled by both the ambient illumination and input from endogenous circadian oscillators. In the present study, we examine the relative influence of these two signals in various species of teleost fish with different latitudes of origin. We find equatorial species show very strong endogenous control. The cones of the glowlight tetra, for example, continue to go through undiminished cycles of contraction and relaxation that mirror the previous light:dark cycle for at least two weeks in continual darkness. To quantify the relative effectiveness of the ambient light compared with endogenous signals in causing cone contraction, the degree to which seven teleost species responded to light during the dark phase of their light:dark cycle was examined. In this situation the retina receives conflicting instructions; while the light is acting directly to cause light adaptation, any endogenous signal tends to keep the retinal elements dark adapted. The further from the equator a species originated, the more its cones contracted in response to such illumination, suggesting animals from higher latitudes make little use of endogenous oscillators and rely more on ambient illumination to control behaviours. Equatorial species, however, rely on internal pacemakers to a much greater degree and are relatively insensitive to exogenous light signals. Because these data are consistent with published observations in systems as diverse as melatonin synthesis in Arctic reindeer and the behaviour of regional populations of Drosophila, latitudinal clines in the efficacy of circadian oscillators may be a common feature among animals."},{"title":"The underwater photic environment of Cape Maclear, Lake Malawi: comparison between rock- and sand-bottom habitats and implications for cichlid fish vision","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/487","abstract":"Lake Malawi boasts the highest diversity of freshwater fishes in the world. Nearshore sites are categorized according to their bottom substrate, rock or sand, and these habitats host divergent assemblages of cichlid fishes. Sexual selection driven by mate choice in cichlids led to spectacular diversification in male nuptial coloration. This suggests that the spectral radiance contrast of fish, the main determinant of visibility under water, plays a crucial role in cichlid visual communication. This study provides the first detailed description of underwater irradiance, radiance and beam attenuation at selected sites representing two major habitats in Lake Malawi. These quantities are essential for estimating radiance contrast and, thus, the constraints imposed on fish body coloration. Irradiance spectra in the sand habitat were shifted to longer wavelengths compared with those in the rock habitat. Beam attenuation in the sand habitat was higher than in the rock habitat. The effects of water depth, bottom depth and proximity to the lake bottom on radiometric quantities are discussed. The radiance contrast of targets exhibiting diffused and spectrally uniform reflectance depended on habitat type in deep water but not in shallow water. In deep water, radiance contrast of such targets was maximal at long wavelengths in the sand habitat and at short wavelengths in the rock habitat. Thus, to achieve conspicuousness, color patterns of rock- and sand-dwelling cichlids would be restricted to short and long wavelengths, respectively. This study provides a useful platform for the examination of cichlid visual communication."},{"title":"Polarised skylight and the landmark panorama provide night-active bull ants with compass information during route following","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/363","abstract":"Navigating animals are known to use a number of celestial and terrestrial compass cues that allow them to determine and control their direction of travel. Which of the cues dominate appears to depend on their salience. Here we show that night-active bull ants attend to both the pattern of polarised skylight and the landmark panorama in their familiar habitat. When the two directional cues are in conflict, ants choose a compromise direction. However, landmark guidance appears to be the primary mechanism of navigation used by forager ants, with those cues in the direction of heading having the greatest influence on navigation. Different colonies respond to the removal of these cues to different degrees, depending on the directional information provided by the local landmark panorama. Interestingly, other parts of the surrounding panorama also influence foraging speed and accuracy, suggesting that they too play a role in navigation."},{"title":"Identification of the elusive peptidergic diuretic hormone in the blood-feeding bug Rhodnius prolixus: a CRF-related peptide","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/371","abstract":"Probing of a host and ingestion of a blood-meal in a fifth instar Rhodnius prolixus results in a cascade of tightly integrated events.

While serotonin is known to be a diuretic hormone in R. prolixus, a peptidergic factor(s) was also known to play a role in diuresis. In the present study we employed molecular techniques and mass spectrometry to determine the sequence of a native CRF-like peptide from R. prolixus (Rhopr DH). In addition, we confirmed the distribution and localization of Rhopr DH using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, and demonstrated its potent biological activity on both the anterior midgut and Malpighian tubules."},{"title":"Aerodynamics of gliding flight in common swifts","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/382","abstract":"Gliding flight performance and wake topology of a common swift (Apus apus L.) were examined in a wind tunnel at speeds between 7 and 11 m s–1. The tunnel was tilted to simulate descending flight at different sink speeds. The swift varied its wingspan, wing area and tail span over the speed range. Wingspan decreased linearly with speed, whereas tail span decreased in a nonlinear manner. For each airspeed, the minimum glide angle was found. The corresponding sink speeds showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a minimum sink speed at 8.1 m s–1 and a speed of best glide at 9.4 m s–1. Lift-to-drag ratio was calculated for each airspeed and tilt angle combinations and the maximum for each speed showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a maximum of 12.5 at an airspeed of 9.5 m s–1. Wake was sampled in the transverse plane using stereo digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). The main structures of the wake were a pair of trailing wingtip vortices and a pair of trailing tail vortices. Circulation of these was measured and a model was constructed that showed good weight support. Parasite drag was estimated from the wake defect measured in the wake behind the body. Parasite drag coefficient ranged from 0.30 to 0.22 over the range of airspeeds. Induced drag was calculated and used to estimate profile drag coefficient, which was found to be in the same range as that previously measured on a Harris' hawk."},{"title":"Perception of echo delay is disrupted by small temporal misalignment of echo harmonics in bat sonar","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/394","abstract":"Echolocating big brown bats emit ultrasonic frequency-modulated (FM) biosonar sounds containing two prominent downward-sweeping harmonics (FM1 and FM2) and perceive target distance from echo delay. In naturally occurring echoes, FM1 and FM2 are delayed by the same amount. Even though echoes from targets located off-axis or far away are lowpass filtered, which weakens FM2 relative to FM1, their delays remain the same. We show here that misalignment of FM2 with FM1 by only 2.6 μs is sufficient to significantly disrupt acuity, which then persists for larger misalignments up to 300 μs. However, when FM2 is eliminated entirely rather than just misaligned, acuity is effectively restored. For naturally occurring, lowpass-filtered echoes, neuronal responses to weakened FM2 are retarded relative to FM1 because of amplitude-latency trading, which misaligns the harmonics in the bat's internal auditory representations. Electronically delaying FM2 relative to FM1 mimics the retarded neuronal responses for FM2 relative to FM1 caused by amplitude-latency trading. Echoes with either electronically or physiologically misaligned harmonics are not perceived as having a clearly defined delay. This virtual collapse of delay acuity may suppress interference from off-axis or distant clutter through degradation of delay images for clutter in contrast to sharp images for nearer, frontal targets."},{"title":"Poor flight performance in deep-diving cormorants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/412","abstract":"Aerial flight and breath-hold diving present conflicting morphological and physiological demands, and hence diving seabirds capable of flight are expected to face evolutionary trade-offs regarding locomotory performances. We tested whether Kerguelen shags Phalacrocorax verrucosus, which are remarkable divers, have poor flight capability using newly developed tags that recorded their flight air speed (the first direct measurement for wild birds) with propeller sensors, flight duration, GPS position and depth during foraging trips. Flight air speed (mean 12.7 m s–1) was close to the speed that minimizes power requirement, rather than energy expenditure per distance, when existing aerodynamic models were applied. Flights were short (mean 92 s), with a mean summed duration of only 24 min day–1. Shags sometimes stayed at the sea surface without diving between flights, even on the way back to the colony, and surface durations increased with the preceding flight durations; these observations suggest that shags rested after flights. Our results indicate that their flight performance is physiologically limited, presumably compromised by their great diving capability (max. depth 94 m, duration 306 s) through their morphological adaptations for diving, including large body mass (enabling a large oxygen store), small flight muscles (to allow for large leg muscles for underwater propulsion) and short wings (to decrease air volume in the feathers and hence buoyancy). The compromise between flight and diving, as well as the local bathymetry, shape the three-dimensional foraging range (<26 km horizontally, <94 m vertically) in this bottom-feeding cormorant."},{"title":"Effects of grade and mass distribution on the mechanics of trotting in dogs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/402","abstract":"Quadrupedal running on grades requires balancing of pitch moments about the center of mass (COM) while supplying sufficient impulse to maintain a steady uphill or downhill velocity. Here, trotting mechanics on a 15 deg grade were characterized by the distribution of impulse between the limbs and the angle of resultant impulse at each limb. Anterior–posterior manipulation of COM position has previously been shown to influence limb mechanics during level trotting of dogs; hence, the combined effects of grade and COM manipulations were explored by adding 10% body mass at the COM, shoulder or pelvis. Whole body and individual limb ground reaction forces, as well as spatiotemporal step parameters, were measured during downhill and uphill trotting. Deviations from steady-speed locomotion were determined by the net impulse angle and accounted for in the statistical model. The limbs exerted only propulsive force during uphill trotting and, with the exception of slight hindlimb propulsion in late stance, only braking force during downhill trotting. Ratios of forelimb impulse to total impulse were computed for normal and shear components. Normal impulse ratios were more different from level values during uphill than downhill trotting, indicating that the limbs act more as levers on the incline. Differential limb function was evident in the extreme divergence of forelimb and hindlimb impulse angles, amplifying forelimb braking and hindlimb propulsive biases observed during level trotting. In both downhill and uphill trotting, added mass at the up-slope limb resulted in fore–hind distributions of normal impulse more similar to those of level trotting and more equal fore–hind distributions of shear impulse. The latter result suggests a functional trade-off in quadruped design: a COM closer to the hindlimbs would distribute downhill braking more equally, whereas a COM closer to the forelimbs would distribute uphill propulsion more equally. Because muscles exert less force when actively shortening than when lengthening, it would be advantageous for the forelimb and hindlimb muscles to share the propulsive burden more equally during uphill trotting. This functional advantage is consistent with the anterior COM position of most terrestrial quadrupeds."},{"title":"Spectral sensitivity of the concave mirror eyes of scallops: potential influences of habitat, self-screening and longitudinal chromatic aberration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/422","abstract":"Scallop eyes contain two retinas, one proximal and one distal. Molecular evidence suggests that each retina expresses a different visual pigment. To test whether these retinas have different spectral sensitivities, we used microspectrophotometry to measure the absorption spectra of photoreceptors from the eyes of two different scallop species. Photoreceptors from the proximal and distal retinas of the sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus had absorption peak wavelengths (λmax) of 488±1 nm (mean ± s.e.m.; N=20) and 513±3 nm (N=26), respectively. Photoreceptors from the corresponding retinas of the bay scallop Argopecten irradians had λmax values of 506±1 nm (N=21) and 535±3 nm (N=14). Assuming that the proximal and distal receptors had equal absorption coefficients (kD=0.0067 μm–1), we found that self-screening within the scallop eye caused the proximal and distal receptors in P. magellanicus to have peak absorption at 490 and 520 nm, respectively, and the corresponding receptors in A. irradians to have peak absorption at 504 and 549 nm. We conclude that environment may influence the λmax of scallop visual pigments: P. magellanicus, generally found in blue oceanic water, has visual pigments that are maximally sensitive to shorter wavelengths than those found in A. irradians, which lives in greener inshore water. Scallop distal retinas may be sensitive to longer wavelengths of light than scallop proximal retinas to correct for either self-screening by the retinas or longitudinal chromatic aberration of the lens."},{"title":"Aerodynamic effects of corrugation in flapping insect wings in hovering flight","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/3/432","abstract":"We have examined the aerodynamic effects of corrugation in model insect wings that closely mimic the wing movements of hovering insects. Computational fluid dynamics were used with Reynolds numbers ranging from 35 to 3400, stroke amplitudes from 70 to 180 deg and mid-stroke angles of incidence from 15 to 60 deg. Various corrugated wing models were tested (care was taken to ensure that the corrugation introduced zero camber). The main results are as follows. At typical mid-stroke angles of incidence of hovering insects (35–50 deg), the time courses of the lift, drag, pitching moment and aerodynamic power coefficients of the corrugated wings are very close to those of the flat-plate wing, and compared with the flat-plate wing, the corrugation changes (decreases) the mean lift by less than 5% and has almost no effect on the mean drag, the location of the center of pressure and the aerodynamic power required. A possible reason for the small aerodynamic effects of wing corrugation is that the wing operates at a large angle of incidence and the flow is separated: the large angle of incidence dominates the corrugation in determining the flow around the wing, and for separated flow, the flow is much less sensitive to wing shape variation. The present results show that for hovering insects, using a flat-plate wing to model the corrugated wing is a good approximation."},{"title":"The influence of drinking water on the δD and δ18O values of house sparrow plasma, blood and feathers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/98","abstract":"We investigated the relationships between the δdeuterium (δD) and the δ18oxygen (δ18O) of drinking water and the δD and δ18O of blood plasma, red blood cells and feathers in house sparrows (Passer domesticus) fed on diets with identical hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions and five isotopically distinct drinking water treatments. We expected and, with only one exception (18O in blood plasma), found linear relationships between the δD and δ18O values of drinking water and those of bird tissues. The slopes of these relationships, which estimate the percentage contributions of drinking water to the tissue isotopic signatures, were lower than those of previous studies. We found significant differences in the δD and δ18O values of feathers, red blood cells and plasma solids. In feathers and red blood cells, δD and δ18O values were linearly correlated. Our results have three implications for isotopic field studies: (1) if the isotopic composition of drinking water differs from that of food, its effect on tissue isotope values can confound the assignment of animals to a site of origin; (2) comparisons of the δD and δ18O values of different tissues must account for inter-tissue discrimination factors; and (3) δD/δ18O linear relationships are probably as prevalent in animal systems as they are in geohydrological systems. These relationships may prove to be useful tools in animal isotopic ecology."},{"title":"Intraspecific scaling of chewing cycle duration in three species of domestic ungulates","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/104","abstract":"In mammals, chewing cycle duration (CCD) increases with various measures of size, scaling with body mass0.13–0.28 and jaw length0.55. Proposed explanations for these scaling relationships include the allometry of body size, basal metabolic rate and tooth size, on the one hand, and pendular mechanics treating the jaw as a gravity-driven pendulum, on the other. Little is known, however, about the relationship between CCD and size within species. Recent research in dogs demonstrates altogether different scaling exponents and weaker correlations. This research suggests that breed-specific growth rates influence the maturation of the neural networks generating chewing rhythm, which may be altered because of changes in jaw mass during early postnatal growth. Here, we explored the intraspecific scaling of CCD within a sample of adult horses ranging from miniatures to draft breeds and an ontogenetic sample of goats and alpacas from infants to adults. In horses, CCD scales with body mass0.19 and jaw length0.57, although in neither case is the correlation significant. In the ontogenetic samples of goats and alpacas, CCD is significantly correlated with body mass, scaling as CCD∝body mass0.37 in both species. In goats, but not alpacas, CCD is also significantly correlated with jaw length, scaling as jaw length1.032. As in dogs, the scaling of CCD in horses may reflect the influence of selective breeding on growth trajectories of different breeds, resulting in reduced body and jaw size differences among infants, when CCD is established, compared with adults. However, the allometric scaling of tooth size in horses of different breeds may be a potential influence on the scaling of CCD. The scaling of CCD with body and jaw size in goats, and to a lesser extent in alpacas, also suggests that the development of peripheral masticatory structures such as the teeth and occlusal relations may play a role in changes in CCD during the earliest stages of postnatal ontogeny."},{"title":"Flowers help bees cope with uncertainty: signal detection and the function of floral complexity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/113","abstract":"Plants often attract pollinators with floral displays composed of visual, olfactory, tactile and gustatory stimuli. Since pollinators' responses to each of these stimuli are usually studied independently, the question of why plants produce multi-component floral displays remains relatively unexplored. Here we used signal detection theory to test the hypothesis that complex displays reduce a pollinator's uncertainty about the floral signal. Specifically, we asked whether one component of the floral display, scent, improved a bee's certainty about the value of another component, color hue. We first trained two groups of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens Cresson) to discriminate between rewarding and unrewarding artificial flowers of slightly different hues in the presence vs absence of scent. In a test phase, we presented these bees with a gradient of floral hues and assessed their ability to identify the hue rewarded during training. We interpreted the extent to which bees' preferences were biased away from the unrewarding hue (‘peak shift’) as an indicator of uncertainty in color discrimination. Our data show that the presence of an olfactory signal reduces uncertainty regarding color: not only was color learning facilitated on scented flowers but also bees showed a lower amount of peak shift in the presence of scent. We explore potential mechanisms by which scent might reduce uncertainty about color, and discuss the broader significance of our results for our understanding of signal evolution."},{"title":"Whistling in caterpillars (Amorpha juglandis, Bombycoidea): sound-producing mechanism and function","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/30","abstract":"Caterpillar defenses have been researched extensively, and, although most studies focus on visually communicated signals, little is known about the role that sounds play in defense. We report on whistling, a novel form of sound production for caterpillars and rare for insects in general. The North American walnut sphinx (Amorpha juglandis) produces whistle ‘trains’ ranging from 44 to 2060 ms in duration and comprising one to eight whistles. Sounds were categorized into three types: broadband, pure whistles and multi-harmonic plus broadband, with mean dominant frequencies at 15 kHz, 9 kHz and 22 kHz, respectively. The mechanism of sound production was determined by selectively obstructing abdominal spiracles, monitoring air flow at different spiracles using a laser vibrometer and recording body movements associated with sound production using high-speed video. Contractions of the anterior body segments always accompanied sound production, forcing air through a pair of enlarged spiracles on the eighth abdominal segment. We tested the hypothesis that sounds function in defense using simulated attacks with blunt forceps and natural attacks with an avian predator – the yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia). In simulated attacks, 94% of caterpillars responded with whistle trains that were frequently accompanied by directed thrashing but no obvious chemical defense. In predator trials, all birds readily attacked the caterpillar, eliciting whistle trains each time. Birds responded to whistling by hesitating, jumping back or diving away from the sound source. We conclude that caterpillar whistles are defensive and propose that they function specifically as acoustic ‘eye spots’ to startle predators."},{"title":"Environmental differences in substrate mechanics do not affect sprinting performance in sand lizards (Uma scoparia and Callisaurus draconoides)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/122","abstract":"Running performance depends on a mechanical interaction between the feet of an animal and the substrate. This interaction may differ between two species of sand lizard from the Mojave Desert that have different locomotor morphologies and habitat distributions. Uma scorparia possesses toe fringes and inhabits dunes, whereas the closely related Callisaurus draconoides lacks fringes and is found on dune and wash habitats. The present study evaluated whether these distribution patterns are related to differential locomotor performance on the fine sand of the dunes and the course sand of the wash habitat. We measured the kinematics of sprinting and characterized differences in grain size distribution and surface strength of the soil in both habitats. Although wash sand had a surface strength (15.4±6.2 kPa) that was more than three times that of dune sand (4.7±2.1 kPa), both species ran with similar sprinting performance on the two types of soil. The broadly distributed C. draconoides ran with a slightly (22%) faster maximum speed (2.2±0.2 m s–1) than the dune-dwelling U. scorparia (1.8±0.2 m s–1) on dune sand, but not on wash sand. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in maximum acceleration or the time to attain maximum speed between species or between substrates. These results suggest that differences in habitat distribution between these species are not related to locomotor performance and that sprinting ability is dominated neither by environmental differences in substrate nor the presence of toe fringes."},{"title":"Directional escape behavior in allis shad (Alosa alosa) exposed to ultrasonic clicks mimicking an approaching toothed whale","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/22","abstract":"Toothed whales emit high-powered ultrasonic clicks to echolocate a wide range of prey. It may be hypothesized that some of their prey species have evolved capabilities to detect and respond to such ultrasonic pulses in a way that reduces predation, akin to the situation for many nocturnal insects and echolocating bats. Using high-speed film recordings and controlled exposures, we obtained behavioural evidence that simulated toothed whale biosonar clicks elicit highly directional anti-predator responses in an ultrasound-sensitive allis shad (Alosa alosa). Ten shad were exposed to 192 dB re. 1 μPa (pp) clicks centred at 40 kHz at repetition rates of 1, 20, 50 and 250 clicks s–1 with summed energy flux density levels of 148, 161, 165 and 172 dB re. 1 μPa2 s. The exposures mimicked the acoustic exposure from a delphinid toothed whale in different phases of prey search and capture. The response times of allis shad were faster for higher repetition rates of clicks with the same sound pressure level. None of the fish responded to a single click, but had median response times of 182, 93 and 57 ms when exposed to click rates of 20, 50 and 250 clicks s–1, respectively. This suggests that the ultrasound detector of allis shad is an energy detector and that shad respond faster when exposed to a nearby fast-clicking toothed whale than to a slow-clicking toothed whale far away. The findings are thus consistent with the hypothesis that shad ultrasound detection is used for reducing predation from echolocating toothed whales."},{"title":"Ambient temperature shapes reproductive output during pregnancy and lactation in the common vole (Microtus arvalis): a test of the heat dissipation limit theory","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/38","abstract":"The heat dissipation limit theory suggests that heat generated during metabolism limits energy intake and, thus, reproductive output. Experiments in laboratory strains of mice and rats, and also domestic livestock generally support this theory. Selection for many generations in the laboratory and in livestock has increased litter size or productivity in these animals. To test the wider validity of the heat dissipation limit theory, we studied common voles (Microtus arvalis), which have small litter sizes by comparison with mice and rats, and regular addition of wild-caught individuals of this species to our laboratory colony ensures a natural genetic background. A crossover design of ambient temperatures (21 and 30°C) during pregnancy and lactation was used. High ambient temperature during lactation decreased milk production, slowing pup growth. The effect on pup growth was amplified when ambient temperature was also high during pregnancy. Shaving fur off dams at 30°C resulted in faster growth of pups; however, no significant increase in food intake and or milk production was detected. With increasing litter size (natural and enlarged), asymptotic food intake during lactation levelled off in the largest litters at both 21 and 30°C. Interestingly, the effects of lactation temperature on pup growth where also observed at smaller litter sizes. This suggests that vole dams trade-off costs associated with hyperthermia during lactation with the yield from investment in pup growth. Moreover, pup survival was higher at 30°C, despite lower growth, probably owing to thermoregulatory benefits. It remains to be seen how the balance is established between the negative effect of high ambient temperature on maternal milk production and pup growth (and/or future reproduction of the dam) and the positive effect of high temperatures on pup survival. This balance ultimately determines the effect of different ambient temperatures on reproductive success."},{"title":"A diverse family of novel peptide toxins from an unusual cone snail, Conus californicus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/147","abstract":"Diversity among Conus toxins mirrors the high species diversity in the Indo-Pacific region, and evolution of both is thought to stem from feeding-niche specialization derived from intra-generic competition. This study focuses on Conus californicus, a phylogenetic outlier endemic to the temperate northeast Pacific. Essentially free of congeneric competitors, it preys on a wider variety of organisms than any other cone snail. Using molecular cloning of cDNAs and mass spectrometry, we examined peptides isolated from venom ducts to elucidate the sequences and post-translational modifications of two eight-cysteine toxins (cal12a and cal12b of type 12 framework) that block voltage-gated Na+ channels. Based on homology of leader sequence and mode of action, these toxins are related to the O-superfamily, but differ significantly from other members of that group. Six of the eight cysteine residues constitute the canonical framework of O-members, but two additional cysteine residues in the N-terminal region define an O+2 classification within the O-superfamily. Fifteen putative variants of Cal12.1 toxins have been identified by mRNAs that differ primarily in two short hypervariable regions and have been grouped into three subtypes (Cal12.1.1–3). This unique modular variation has not been described for other Conus toxins and suggests recombination as a diversity-generating mechanism. We propose that these toxin isoforms show specificity for similar molecular targets (Na+ channels) in the many species preyed on by C. californicus and that individualistic utilization of specific toxin isoforms may involve control of gene expression."},{"title":"Mechanics, hydrodynamics and energetics of blue whale lunge feeding: efficiency dependence on krill density","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/131","abstract":"Lunge feeding by rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) is associated with a high energetic cost that decreases diving capacity, thereby limiting access to dense prey patches at depth. Despite this cost, rorquals exhibit high rates of lipid deposition and extremely large maximum body size. To address this paradox, we integrated kinematic data from digital tags with unsteady hydrodynamic models to estimate the energy budget for lunges and foraging dives of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), the largest rorqual and living mammal. Our analysis suggests that, despite the large amount of mechanical work required to lunge feed, a large amount of prey and, therefore, energy is obtained during engulfment. Furthermore, we suggest that foraging efficiency for blue whales is significantly higher than for other marine mammals by nearly an order of magnitude, but only if lunges target extremely high densities of krill. The high predicted efficiency is attributed to the enhanced engulfment capacity, rapid filter rate and low mass-specific metabolic rate associated with large body size in blue whales. These results highlight the importance of high prey density, regardless of prey patch depth, for efficient bulk filter feeding in baleen whales and may explain some diel changes in foraging behavior in rorqual whales."},{"title":"Foreign genes and novel hydrophilic protein genes participate in the desiccation response of the bdelloid rotifer Adineta ricciae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/59","abstract":"Bdelloid rotifers are aquatic micro-invertebrates with the ability to survive extreme desiccation, or anhydrobiosis, at any life stage. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms used by bdelloids during anhydrobiosis, we constructed a cDNA library enriched for genes that are upregulated in Adineta ricciae 24 h after onset of dehydration. Resulting expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were analysed and sequences grouped into categories according to their probable identity. Of 75 unique sequences, approximately half (36) were similar to known genes from other species. These included genes encoding an unusual group 3 late embryogenesis abundant protein, and a number of other stress-related and DNA repair proteins. Open reading frames from a further 39 novel sequences, without counterparts in the database, were screened for the characteristics of intrinsically disordered proteins, i.e. hydrophilicity and lack of stable secondary structure. Such proteins have been implicated in desiccation tolerance and at least five were found. The majority of the genes identified was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR to be capable of upregulation in response to evaporative water loss. Remarkably, further database and phylogenetic analysis highlighted four ESTs that are present in the A. ricciae genome but which represent genes probably arising from fungi or bacteria by horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, not only can bdelloid rotifers accumulate foreign genes and render them transcriptionally competent, but their expression pattern can be modified for participation in the desiccation stress response, and is presumably adaptive in this context."},{"title":"Opening and closing mechanisms of the leatherback sea turtle larynx: a crucial role for the tongue","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4137","abstract":"A combination of dissection and computed tomography scanning has provided significant novel insights into the structure and function of the Dermochelys coriacea larynx and its associated muscles. Several previously unknown features of the laryngeal aditus (glottis) are described and their functional significance in its opening and closure are considered. The tongue plays an essential part in producing and maintaining closure during dives and feeding bouts. Closure is brought about by compression of the glottis under the action of the two hyoglossus muscles. The tongue thus plays the role of the epiglottis of mammals, sealing the entrance to the larynx. As is already clear, opening is brought about by abduction of the arytenoid cartilages. In addition, there is a powerful mechanism for maintaining the larynx in close apposition to the hyoid plate during feeding and neck flexion, thereby enhancing the efficiency of feeding."},{"title":"Optimisation in a natural system: Argentine ants solve the Towers of Hanoi","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/50","abstract":"Natural systems are a source of inspiration for computer algorithms designed to solve optimisation problems. Yet most ‘nature-inspired’ algorithms take only superficial inspiration from biology, and little is known about how real biological systems solve difficult problems. Moreover, ant algorithms, neural networks and similar methods are usually applied to static problems, whereas most biological systems have evolved to perform under dynamically changing conditions. We used the Towers of Hanoi puzzle to test whether Argentine ants can solve a potentially difficult optimisation problem. We also tested whether the ants can adapt to dynamic changes in the problem. We mapped all possible solutions to the Towers of Hanoi on a single graph and converted this into a maze for the ants to solve. We show that the ants are capable of solving the Towers of Hanoi, and are able to adapt when sections of the maze are blocked off and new sections installed. The presence of exploration pheromone increased the efficiency of the resulting network and increased the ants' ability to adapt to changing conditions. Contrary to previous studies, our study shows that mass-recruiting ant species such as the Argentine ant can forage effectively in a dynamic environment. Our results also suggest that novel optimisation algorithms can benefit from stronger biological mimicry."},{"title":"Kinematics of phonotactic steering in the walking cricket Gryllus bimaculatus (de Geer)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/69","abstract":"Female crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, are attracted by the male calling song and approach singing males; a behaviour known as phonotaxis. Even tethered females walking on a trackball steer towards a computer-generated male song presented from their left or right side. High-speed video analysis showed how this auditory-evoked steering was integrated with walking. Typically all the front and middle legs showed kinematic adjustments during steering, with the trajectories tilted towards the side of acoustic stimulation. Furthermore, the average speed of the tarsi contralateral to song increased relative to the ipsilateral tarsi. Kinematic changes of the hind legs were small and may be a consequence of the front and middle leg adjustments. Although phonotactic steering generally led to stereotyped adjustments there were differences in the specific combination of kinematic changes in leg trajectories. The most reliable kinematic steering response was by the contralateral front leg, such that, during its swing phase the tarsus moved towards the side of acoustic stimulation through an increased forward rotation of the femur and an increased extension of the tibia. Relating the changes in tarsal positioning of each leg to the steering velocity of the animal indicated that typically the front and middle legs contralateral to song generated the turning forces. Phonotactic steering was integrated into forward walking without changes to the walking motor cycle."},{"title":"Visualizing a set of olfactory sensory neurons responding to a bile salt","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/80","abstract":"In the present study, we exposed the olfactory epithelia of crucian carp, Carassius carassius, and brown trout, Salmo trutta, to dextran coupled with Alexa dyes together with odorants. Dye uptake was severely reduced after pre-exposure to nocodazole, an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization that impairs endocytosis, supporting the hypothesis that odour-activated olfactory receptor molecules undergo endocytosis. Application of the bile acid taurolithocholate, a potent and specific odorant for fish, resulted in the labelling of a sparse (less than 3%) cell population with the typical morphology of ciliated sensory neurons (CSNs) – long dendrites and cell somata deep in the sensory epithelium. The dye was distributed throughout the sensory neuron, also revealing axons and target glomeruli. Stained axons redistribute at the entrance of the olfactory bulb and terminate in two small target areas, a dorsal and a medial one. These results are consistent with the notion that taurolithocholate is detected specifically by a few ciliated sensory neurons. Application of the olfactory epithelium of brown trout to bile acid stained cells with the appearance of CSNs. Application of an alarm agonist, hypxanthine-3-N-oxide, to crucian carp olfactory organ caused staining of another set of sensory neurons. Furthermore, our results show that odour-induced uptake of a dye can serve to identify the subtype of olfactory sensory neurons responding to a particular odorant, and to pinpoint the target regions of these neurons in the olfactory bulb as a first step to elucidating the neuronal network responding to a particular odour."},{"title":"State-dependent physiological maintenance in a long-lived ectotherm, the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/1/88","abstract":"Energy allocation among somatic maintenance, reproduction and growth varies not only among species, but among individuals according to states such as age, sex and season. Little research has been conducted on the somatic (physiological) maintenance of long-lived organisms, particularly ectotherms such as reptiles. In this study, we examined sex differences and age- and season-related variation in immune function and DNA repair efficiency in a long-lived reptile, the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta). Immune components tended to be depressed during hibernation, in winter, compared with autumn or spring. Increased heterophil count during hibernation provided the only support for winter immunoenhancement. In juvenile and adult turtles, we found little evidence for senescence in physiological maintenance, consistent with predictions for long-lived organisms. Among immune components, swelling in response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and control injection increased with age, whereas basophil count decreased with age. Hatchling turtles had reduced basophil counts and natural antibodies, indicative of an immature immune system, but demonstrated higher DNA repair efficiency than older turtles. Reproductively mature turtles had reduced lymphocytes compared with juvenile turtles in the spring, presumably driven by a trade-off between maintenance and reproduction. Sex had little influence on physiological maintenance. These results suggest that components of physiological maintenance are modulated differentially according to individual state and highlight the need for more research on the multiple components of physiological maintenance in animals of variable states."},{"title":"Knocking down expression of Hsp22 and Hsp23 by RNA interference affects recovery from chill coma in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4146","abstract":"To protect cells from the damaging effects of environmental stresses, all organisms possess a universal stress response involving upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps). The mechanisms underlying chilling injuries and the subsequent recovery phase are only beginning to be understood in insects. Hsp22 and Hsp23 are both upregulated during the recovery from prolonged chill coma in Drosophila melanogaster. This prompted us to investigate the functional significance of these modulations by testing whether expression of these two small Hsps is necessary for recovery after cold stress. We used the GAL4/UAS system to separately knock down expression of Hsp22 and Hsp23, and assayed three aspects of recovery performance in transgenic adults that had undergone 12 h of chill coma at 0°C. The time to recover (short-term recovery) and mobility parameters (medium-term recovery) were significantly impaired in the transgenic flies in which Hsp22 or Hsp23 was suppressed. Our findings show that both Hsp22 and Hsp23 play important roles in the recovery from chill coma in adult males, and suggest that these contribute to adaptive responses to fluctuating thermal conditions."},{"title":"Effects of insulin infusion on glucose homeostasis and glucose metabolism in rainbow trout fed a high-carbohydrate diet","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4151","abstract":"The origin for the poor glucose utilization in carnivorous fish species fed high carbohydrate diets remains under debate. In the present study, we have fed rainbow trout a diet containing 30% carbohydrate for 1 or 5 days. In both cases, fish were implanted with mini-osmotic pumps releasing 0.7 i.u. kg–1 day–1 bovine insulin, and mRNA transcripts and the protein phosphorylation status of proteins controlling glycemia and glucose-related metabolism were studied in fish killed 6 h after the last meal. We demonstrate that when the exposure occurs over a short term (30 h), insulin exerts beneficial actions on trout glucose homeostasis, including a lowered glycemia and increased hepatic lipogenic and glycogenic potentials. However, when trout were fed for 5 days, these beneficial actions of insulin infusion were no longer observed. Thus, the increased lipogenic potential observed after one single meal was not present, and this together with the increased glycogenesis and the decreased glucose exported to the blood from the liver explains the lack of hypoglycemic action of insulin. The fact that insulin improved glucose homeostasis when administrated over a short time period implies that endogenous insulin secretion is inadequate in trout to deal with this amount of dietary carbohydrates. Moreover, the fact that a longer exposure to insulin resulted in a reduced response indicates that the rainbow trout is sensitive to insulin, re-enforcing the hypothesis that the hyperglycemia observed following a high carbohydrate meal is an insulin secretion issue rather an insulin action issue."},{"title":"Piloting in desert ants: pinpointing the goal by discrete landmarks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4174","abstract":"The inconspicuous nest entrances of the Namibian desert ant Ocymyrmex robustior are located on barren sandflats often devoid of any goal-defining landmark. Foragers that have returned by path integration to the rough area of the goal need a considerable amount of time to finally pinpoint the goal. Even a single landmark decreases the search time dramatically. By using artificial landmarks placed in the neighbourhood of the goal, we show that the larger the image transformations (caused by the landmarks) in the ant's visual field, the faster the homing ants localize the goal. While approaching the goal the ants do not try to fixate the landmarks frontally. Hence, even if provided with discrete landmarks rather than extended visual scenes, Ocymyrmex relies on image changes occurring in wide areas of its panoramic field of view rather than those occurring in a frontal fixation area alone."},{"title":"Presynaptic Ca2+ stores contribute to odor-induced responses in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4163","abstract":"In both vertebrates and invertebrates, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) respond to several odors. They also adapt to stimulus variations, and this is considered to be a simple form of non-associative learning and neuronal plasticity. Different mechanisms have been described to support neuronal and/or synaptic plasticity. For example in vertebrates, presynaptic Ca2+ stores relying on either the ryanodine receptor (RyR) or the inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) have been reported to participate in synaptic transmission, in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, and in basket cell–Purkinje cell synapses. However, in invertebrates, especially in sensory neurons such as ORNs, similar mechanisms have not yet been detected. In this study, using Drosophila and taking advantage of an in vivo bioluminescence Ca2+-imaging technique in combination with genetic and pharmacological tools, first we show that the GFP–aequorin Ca2+ sensor is sensitive enough to detect odor-induced responses of various durations. Second, we show that for a relatively long (5 s) odor application, odor-induced Ca2+ responses occurring in the axon terminals of ORNs involve intracellular Ca2+ stores. This response is decreased by specifically targeting InsP3R or RyR by RNAi, or application of the specific blockers thapsigargin or ryanodine, suggesting that Ca2+ stores serve to amplify the presynaptic signal. Furthermore, we show that disrupting the intracellular Ca2+ stores in the ORNs has functional consequences since InsP3R- or RyR-RNAi expressing flies were defective in olfactory behavior. Altogether, our results indicate that for long odor applications in Drosophila, the olfactory response depends on intracellular Ca2+ stores within the axon terminals of the ORNs."},{"title":"Fluid–structure interaction simulation of an avian flight model","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4180","abstract":"A three-dimensional numerical avian model was developed to investigate the unsteady and turbulent aerodynamic performance of flapping wings for varying wingbeat frequencies and flow velocities (up to 12 Hz and 9 m s–1), corresponding to a reduced frequency range of k=0.22 to k=1.0 and a Reynolds number range of Re=16,000 to Re=50,000. The wings of the bird-inspired model consist of an elastic membrane. Simplifying the complicated locomotion kinematics to a sinusoidal wing rotation about two axes, the main features of dynamic avian flight were approximated. Numerical simulation techniques of fluid–structure interaction (FSI) providing a fully resolved flow field were applied to calculate the aerodynamic performance of the flapping elastic wings with the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) approach. The results were used to characterize and describe the macroscopic flow configurations in terms of starting, stopping, trailing and bound vortices. For high reduced frequencies up to k=0.67 it was shown that the wake does not consist of individual vortex rings known as the discrete vortex ring gait. Rather, the wake is dominated by a chain of elliptical vortex rings on each wing. The structures are interlocked at the starting and stopping vortices, which are shed in pairs at the reversal points of the wingbeat cycle. For decreasing reduced frequency, the results indicate a transition to a continuous vortex gait. The upstroke becomes more aerodynamically active, leading to a consistent circulation of the bound vortex on the wing and a continuous spanwise shedding of small scale vortices. The formation of the vortices shed spanwise in pairs at the reversal points is reduced and the wake is dominated by the tip and root vortices, which form long drawn-out vortex structures."},{"title":"Disrupting vagal feedback affects birdsong motor control","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4193","abstract":"Coordination of different motor systems for sound production involves the use of feedback mechanisms. Song production in oscines is a well-established animal model for studying learned vocal behavior. Whereas the online use of auditory feedback has been studied in the songbird model, very little is known about the role of other feedback mechanisms. Auditory feedback is required for the maintenance of stereotyped adult song. In addition, the use of somatosensory feedback to maintain pressure during song has been demonstrated with experimentally induced fluctuations in air sac pressure. Feedback information mediating this response is thought to be routed to the central nervous system via afferent fibers of the vagus nerve. Here, we tested the effects of unilateral vagotomy on the peripheral motor patterns of song production and the acoustic features. Unilateral vagotomy caused a variety of disruptions and alterations to the respiratory pattern of song, some of which affected the acoustic structure of vocalizations. These changes were most pronounced a few days after nerve resection and varied between individuals. In the most extreme cases, the motor gestures of respiration were so severely disrupted that individual song syllables or the song motif were atypically terminated. Acoustic changes also suggest altered use of the two sound generators and upper vocal tract filtering, indicating that the disruption of vagal feedback caused changes to the motor program of all motor systems involved in song production and modification. This evidence for the use of vagal feedback by the song system with disruption of song during the first days after nerve cut provides a contrast to the longer-term effects of auditory feedback disruption. It suggests a significant role for somatosensory feedback that differs from that of auditory feedback."},{"title":"Environment and activity affect skin temperature in breeding adult male elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4205","abstract":"The large body size and high rates of metabolic heat production associated with male mating success in polygynous systems creates potential thermoregulatory challenges for species breeding in warm climates. This is especially true for marine predators carrying large blubber reserves intended for thermoregulation in cold water and fuel provision during extended fasts. Thermographic images were used to measure changes in skin temperature (TS) in adult male northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) over the breeding season. Environmental variables, primarily ambient temperature and solar radiation, were the principal determinants of mean and maximum TS. When controlled for environmental variables, dominance rank significantly impacted mean TS, being highest in alpha males. Behavioral activity significantly influenced TS but in a counter-intuitive way, with inactive males exhibiting the highest TS. This was likely due to strong impacts of environmental variables on the kinds of behavior exhibited, with males being less active on warm, humid days at peak solar radiation. We classified thermal windows as areas in which TS was one standard deviation greater than mean TS for the individual seal within a thermograph. Thermal features suggest active physiological thermoregulation during and after combat and significant circulatory adaptations for heat dumping, as evidenced by recurring locations of thermal windows representing widely varying TS values. Frequent observations of localized TS above 37°C, particularly after combat, suggest the production of thermoregulatory stress during breeding behavior. Our findings demonstrate the importance of environmental drivers in shaping activity patterns during breeding and provide evidence for thermoregulatory costs of successful breeding in large polygynous males."},{"title":"Photoentrainment in blind and sighted rodent species: responses to photophase light with different wavelengths","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4213","abstract":"Our study examined the impact of daylight (photophase) wavelength on the photoentrainment sensitivity of two species with vastly different visual systems. Social voles (Microtus socialis) and ‘blind’ mole rats (Spalax ehrenbergi) were exposed to short-wavelength (479 nm) or long-wavelength (697 nm) light at an intensity of 293 μW cm–2. Rhythms of urine production, urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6-SMT), urinary metabolites of adrenaline and cortisol, and oxygen consumption (VO2) were used as markers for the sensitivity of the photoentrainment system. Significant 24-h rhythms were detected in all variables for both species under short-wavelength light, whereas ultradian rhythms of 12- or 8-h were detected under long-wavelength light. Wavelength inversely affected 6-SMT levels in M. socialis (negative correlation) and S. ehrenbergi (positive correlation). Increased levels of stress hormone metabolites were detected in M. socialis under the long-wavelength light whereas, in S. ehrenbergi elevated levels were secreted under short-wavelength light. Long-wavelength light increased VO2 in M. socialis and decreased it in S. ehrenbergi; short-wavelength light elicited the opposite effects. Our results indicate that photophase wavelength is an integral light property for modulating photoperiodic responses in mammals, including visually challenged species. Finally, the spectral-induced differential responses between the two species potentially represent adaptive physiological flexibility in species with contrasting visual and habitat challenges."},{"title":"Mechanics and kinematics of backward burrowing by the polychaete Cirriformia moorei","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4272","abstract":"The polychaete Cirriformia moorei burrows in muddy sediments by fracture, using its hydrostatic skeleton to expand its anterior region and exert force against its burrow wall to extend a crack. Burrowing occurs in four phases: stretching forward into the burrow, extending the crack anteriorly, thickening the burrowing end to amplify stress at the tip of the crack, and bringing the rest of the body forward as a peristaltic wave travels posteriorly. Here, we show that C. moorei is also able to burrow with its posterior end using a similar mechanism of crack propagation and exhibiting the same four phases of burrowing. Worms burrowed backwards with similar speeds and stress intensity factors as forward burrowing, but were thinner and less blunt and did not slip as far away from the crack tip between cycles of burrowing. The anterior end is more muscular and rigid, and differences in body shapes are consistent with having reduce musculature to dilate the posterior segments while burrowing. Backward burrowing provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of morphology on burrowing mechanics within the same species under identical conditions."},{"title":"Functional morphology and three-dimensional kinematics of the thoraco-lumbar region of the spine of the two-toed sloth","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4278","abstract":"Given the importance of thoraco-lumbar spine movements in the locomotion of mammals, it is surprising that in vivo three-dimensional (3-D) data on the intervertebral movement of the mammalian thoraco-lumbar vertebral column during symmetrical gaits is limited to horses and dogs. To test whether kinematic patterns similar to those published for these cursorial species are also present during a contrasting mode of quadrupedalism, we quantified thoraco-lumbar intervertebral movements, the resulting pelvic displacements and relative femoral movements during the trot-like steady-state suspensory quadrupedal locomotion of the two-toed sloth (Xenarthra, Choloepus didactylus). Scientific rotoscoping, a new, non-invasive approach that combines synchronous biplanar high speed X-ray videos and the reconstruction of skeletal elements from computed tomography bone scans, was used to quantify 3-D kinematics. An analysis of vertebral anatomy and epaxial muscle topography suggests that the thoraco-lumbar spine of sloths is well suited to producing lateral bending and long-axis rotation, but limits powerful sagittal extension. Sloths exhibit complex 3-D movements in the thoraco-lumbar spine that are comparable to those observed in other arboreal quadrupedal mammals. Monophasic lateral bending and long-axis rotation, biphasic sagittal bending and maximal amplitude of sagittal bending at the lumbo-sacral joint were also found in other quadruped mammals and may represent general aspects of mammalian symmetric gaits. Maximal amplitude of lateral bending and long-axis rotation vary in regard to the vertebral level. It is suggested that a cranio-caudal pattern of angular deflections of the spine results from the out-of-phase movement of diagonal forelimbs and hindlimbs in other walking gaits, because it is not evident in the trot-like locomotion analyzed here. The analysis also illustrates the difficulties that arise when lumbar movement is deduced from intervertebral joint morphology alone."},{"title":"Substrate diameter and compliance affect the gripping strategies and locomotor mode of climbing boa constrictors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4249","abstract":"Arboreal habitats pose unique challenges for locomotion as a result of their narrow cylindrical surfaces and discontinuities between branches. Decreased diameter of branches increases compliance, which can pose additional challenges, including effects on stability and energy damping. However, the combined effects of substrate diameter and compliance are poorly understood for any animal. We quantified performance, kinematics and substrate deformation while boa constrictors (Boa constrictor) climbed vertical ropes with three diameters (3, 6 and 9 mm) and four tensions (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 body weights). Mean forward velocity decreased significantly with both decreased diameter and increased compliance. Both diameter and compliance had numerous effects on locomotor kinematics, but diameter had larger and more pervasive effects than compliance. Locomotion on the largest diameter had a larger forward excursion per cycle, and the locomotor mode and gripping strategy differed from that on the smaller diameters. On larger diameters, snakes primarily applied opposing forces at the same location on the rope to grip. By contrast, on smaller diameters forces were applied in opposite directions at different locations along the rope, resulting in increased rope deformation. Although energy is likely to be lost during deformation, snakes might use increased surface deformation as a strategy to enhance their ability to grip."},{"title":"Coding and interaction of sex pheromone and plant volatile signals in the antennal lobe of the codling moth Cydia pomonella","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4291","abstract":"In the codling moth Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) plant volatiles attract males and females by upwind flight and synergise the male response to the female-produced sex pheromone, indicating a close relationship between the perception of social and environmental olfactory signals. We have studied the anatomical and functional organisation of the antennal lobe (AL), the primary olfactory centre, of C. pomonella with respect to the integration of sex pheromone and host-plant volatile information. A three-dimensional reconstruction of the glomerular structure of the AL revealed 50±2 and 49±2 glomeruli in males and females, respectively. These glomeruli are functional units involved in the coding of odour quality. The glomerular map of the AL was then integrated with electrophysiological recordings of the response of individual neurons in the AL of males and females to sex pheromone components and behaviourally active plant volatiles. By means of intracellular recordings and stainings, we physiologically characterised ca. 50 neurons in each sex, revealing complex patterns of activation and a wide variation in response dynamics to these test compounds. Stimulation with single chemicals and their two-component blends produced both synergistic and inhibitory interactions in projection neurons innervating ordinary glomeruli and the macroglomerular complex. Our results show that the sex pheromone and plant odours are processed in an across-fibre coding pattern. The lack of a clear segregation between the pheromone and general odour subsystems in the AL of the codling moth suggests a level of interaction that has not been reported from other insects."},{"title":"Human walking isn't all hard work: evidence of soft tissue contributions to energy dissipation and return","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4257","abstract":"The muscles and tendons of the lower extremity are generally considered the dominant producers of positive and negative work during gait. However, soft-tissue deformations not captured by joint rotations might also dissipate, store and even return substantial energy to the body. A key locomotion event is the collision of the leg with the ground, which deforms soft tissues appreciably in running. Significant deformation might also result from the impulsive ground collision in walking. In a study of normal human walking (N=10; 0.7–2.0 m s–1 speeds), we show indirect evidence for both negative and positive work performed by soft tissue, consistent with a damped elastic collision and rebound. We used the difference between measured joint work and another quantity – the work performed on the body center of mass – to indicate possible work performed by soft tissue. At 1.25 m s–1, we estimated that soft tissue performs approximately 7.5 J of negative work per collision. This constitutes approximately 60% of the total negative collision work and 31% of the total negative work per stride. The amount of soft tissue work during collision increases sharply with speed. Each collision is followed by 4 J of soft tissue rebound that is also not captured by joint work measures. Soft tissue deformation may save muscles the effort of actively dissipating energy, and soft tissue elastic rebound could save up to 14% of the total positive work per stride. Soft tissues not only cushion impacts but also appear to perform substantial work."},{"title":"Shallow-water wave lensing in coral reefs: a physical and biological case study","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4304","abstract":"Wave lensing produces the highest level of transient solar irradiances found in nature, ranging in intensity over several orders of magnitude in just a few tens of milliseconds. Shallow coral reefs can be exposed to wave lensing during light-wind, clear-sky conditions, which have been implicated as a secondary cause of mass coral bleaching through light stress. Management strategies to protect small areas of high-value reef from wave-lensed light stress were tested using seawater irrigation sprinklers to negate wave lensing by breaking up the water surface. A series of field and tank experiments investigated the physical and photophysiological response of the shallow-water species Stylophora pistillata and Favites abdita to wave lensing and sprinkler conditions. Results show that the sprinkler treatment only slightly reduces the total downwelling photosynthetically active and ultraviolet irradiance (∼5.0%), whereas it dramatically reduces, by 460%, the irradiance variability caused by wave lensing. Despite this large reduction in variability and modest reduction in downwelling irradiance, there was no detectable difference in photophysiological response of the corals between control and sprinkler treatments under two thermal regimes of ambient (27°C) and heated treatment (31°C). This study suggests that shallow-water coral species are not negatively affected by the strong flashes that occur under wave-lensing conditions."},{"title":"Mechanics and energetics of step-to-step transitions isolated from human walking","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4265","abstract":"We isolated step-to-step transitions from other contributors to walking mechanics using a cyclical rocking task and then examined the contribution of individual joints to the total work required to redirect the velocity of the center of mass (COM). Nine participants were instructed to rock backward and forward in the sagittal plane, eliminating the need to swing the legs and progress forward. To systematically increase the required work, we increased step length from 60 to 100% of leg length, keeping rocking frequency constant. The individual limbs method quantified the COM work and the joint power method apportioned the COM work among its various sources. As predicted by a physics-based model, we found that work in rocking was performed mainly during the step-to-step transitions and increased strongly with step length. We also found that increases in the average COM work rate exacted a proportional metabolic cost. The similar patterns of COM work and COM work rate during rocking and walking support the use of rocking to isolate the mechanics of step-to-step transitions. We found that the ankle was the main joint contributing to the positive work required to redirect the COM velocity during forward rocking. At the longest length, it accounted for 88% of the work performed by the trailing leg joints. Interestingly, the summed contribution of ankle, knee and hip joint work accounted for only 39% of the front leg negative COM work during the forward transition, suggesting that most of the collision work is performed by passive tissue."},{"title":"Mechanisms of temperature-dependent swimming: the importance of physics, physiology and body size in determining protist swimming speed","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4223","abstract":"Body temperatures and thus physiological rates of poikilothermic organisms are determined by environmental temperature. The power an organism has available for swimming is largely dependent on physiological rates and thus body temperature. However, retarding forces such as drag are contingent on the temperature-dependent physical properties of water and on an organism's size. Consequently, the swimming ability of poikilotherms is highly temperature dependent. The importance of the temperature-dependent physical properties of water (e.g. viscosity) in determining swimming speed is poorly understood. Here we propose a semi-mechanistic model to describe how biological rates, size and the physics of the environment contribute to the temperature dependency of microbial swimming speed. Data on the swimming speed and size of a predatory protist and its protist prey were collected and used to test our model. Data were collected by manipulating both the temperature and the viscosity (independently of temperature) of the organism's environment. Protists were either cultured in their test environment (for several generations) or rapidly exposed to their test environment to assess their ability to adapt or acclimate to treatments. Both biological rates and the physics of the environment were predicted to and observed to contribute to the swimming speed of protists. Body size was not temperature dependent, and protists expressed some ability to acclimate to changes in either temperature or viscosity. Overall, using our parameter estimates and novel model, we are able to suggest that 30 to 40% (depending on species) of the response in swimming speed associated with a reduction in temperature from 20 to 5°C is due to viscosity. Because encounter rates between protist predators and their prey are determined by swimming speed, temperature- and viscosity-dependent swimming speeds are likely to result in temperature- and viscosity-dependent trophic interactions."},{"title":"Sensorimotor gating in NTS1 and NTS2 null mice: effects of d-amphetamine, dizocilpine, clozapine and NT69L","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4232","abstract":"Pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex is deficient in patients with schizophrenia. This deficiency is mimicked in mice by the use of the psychotomimetic drugs d-amphetamine and dizolcipine. Antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine are used to treat schizophrenic patients and are also administered to mice to prevent PPI disruption. Neurotensin (NT) produces antipsychotic-like effects when injected into rodent brain through its effects at NT subtype 1 (NTS1) and 2 (NTS2) receptors. We hypothesized that the NT receptor agonist (NT69L) would prevent PPI disruption in mice challenged with d-amphetamine (10 mg kg–1) and dizocilpine (1 mg kg–1). We investigated the role of NTS1 and NTS2 in PPI using wild-type (WT), NTS1 (NTS1–/–) and NTS2 (NTS2–/–) knockout mice, via its disruption by psychotomimetic drugs, as well as the ability of clozapine and NT69L to block these PPI disruptions. There were no differences in baseline PPI across the three genotypes. d-Amphetamine and dizocilpine disrupted PPI in WT and NTS2–/– mice but not in NTS1–/– mice. In WT mice, clozapine (1 mg kg–1) and NT69L (1 mg kg–1) significantly blocked d-amphetamine-induced disruption of PPI. Similarly, in WT mice, clozapine significantly blocked dizocilpine-induced PPI disruption, but NT69L did not. In NTS2–/– mice clozapine blocked d-amphetamine-but not dizocilpine-induced PPI disruption, while NT69L blocked both d-amphetamine- and dizocilpine-induced PPI disruption. Our results indicate that NTS1 seems essential for d-amphetamine and dizocilpine disruption of PPI. Additionally, this report provides support to the hypothesis that NT analogs could be used as novel antipsychotic drugs."},{"title":"Behaviour and buoyancy regulation in the deepest-diving reptile: the leatherback turtle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4074","abstract":"In the face of the physical and physiological challenges of performing breath-hold deep dives, marine vertebrates have evolved different strategies. Although behavioural strategies in marine mammals and seabirds have been investigated in detail, little is known about the deepest-diving reptile – the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). Here, we deployed tri-axial accelerometers on female leatherbacks nesting on St Croix, US Virgin Islands, to explore their diving strategy. Our results show a consistent behavioural pattern within dives among individuals, with an initial period of active swimming at relatively steep descent angles (∼–40 deg), with a stroke frequency of 0.32 Hz, followed by a gliding phase. The depth at which the gliding phase began increased with the maximum depth of the dives. In addition, descent body angles and vertical velocities were higher during deeper dives. Leatherbacks might thus regulate their inspired air-volume according to the intended dive depth, similar to hard-shelled turtles and penguins. During the ascent, turtles actively swam with a stroke frequency of 0.30 Hz but with a low vertical velocity (∼0.40 ms–1) and a low pitch angle (∼+26 deg). Turtles might avoid succumbing to decompression sickness (‘the bends’) by ascending slowly to the surface. In addition, we suggest that the low body temperature of this marine ectotherm compared with that of endotherms might help reduce the risk of bubble formation by increasing the solubility of nitrogen in the blood. This physiological advantage, coupled with several behavioural and physical adaptations, might explain the particular ecological niche the leatherback turtle occupies among marine reptiles."},{"title":"Molecular evidence for color discrimination in the Atlantic sand fiddler crab, Uca pugilator","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4240","abstract":"Fiddler crabs are intertidal brachyuran crabs that belong to the genus Uca. Approximately 97 different species have been identified, and several of these live sympatrically. Many have species-specific body color patterns that may act as signals for intra- and interspecific communication. To understand the behavioral and ecological role of this coloration we must know whether fiddler crabs have the physiological capacity to perceive color cues. Using a molecular approach, we identified the opsin-encoding genes and determined their expression patterns across the eye of the sand fiddler crab, Uca pugilator. We identified three different opsin-encoding genes (UpRh1, UpRh2 and UpRh3). UpRh1 and UpRh2 are highly related and have similarities in their amino acid sequences to other arthropod long- and medium-wavelength-sensitive opsins, whereas UpRh3 is similar to other arthropod UV-sensitive opsins. All three opsins are expressed in each ommatidium, in an opsin-specific pattern. UpRh3 is present only in the R8 photoreceptor cell, whereas UpRh1 and UpRh2 are present in the R1-7 cells, with UpRh1 expression restricted to five cells and UpRh2 expression present in three cells. Thus, one photoreceptor in every ommatidium expresses both UpRh1 and UpRh2, providing another example of sensory receptor coexpression. These results show that U. pugilator has the basic molecular machinery for color perception, perhaps even trichromatic vision."},{"title":"The spectral quality of light is a key driver of photosynthesis and photoadaptation in Stylophora pistillata colonies from different depths in the Red Sea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4084","abstract":"Depth zonation on coral reefs is largely driven by the amount of downwelling, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) that is absorbed by the symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) of corals. The minimum light requirements of zooxanthellae are related to both the total intensity of downwelling PAR and the spectral quality of the light. Here we used Stylophora pistillata colonies collected from shallow (3 m) and deep (40 m) water; colonies were placed in a respirometer under both ambient PAR irradiance and a filter that only transmits blue light. We found that the colonies exhibited a clear difference in their photosynthetic rates when illuminated under PAR and filtered blue light, with higher photosynthetic performance when deep colonies were exposed to blue light compared with full-spectrum PAR for the same light intensity and duration. By contrast, colonies from shallow water showed the opposite trend, with higher photosynthetic performances under full-spectrum PAR than under filtered blue light. These findings are supported by the absorption spectra of corals, with deeper colonies absorbing higher energy wavelengths than the shallow colonies, with different spectral signatures. Our results indicate that S. pistillata colonies are chromatically adapted to their surrounding light environment, with photoacclimation probably occurring via an increase in photosynthetic pigments rather than algal density. The spectral properties of the downwelling light are clearly a crucial component of photoacclimation that should be considered in future transplantation and photoacclimation studies."},{"title":"Characterization of mechanisms for Ca2+ and HCO3–/CO32– acquisition for shell formation in embryos of the freshwater common pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4092","abstract":"The freshwater common pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis produces embryos that complete direct development, hatching as shell-bearing individuals within 10 days despite relatively low ambient calcium and carbonate availability. This development is impaired by removal of ambient total calcium but not by removal of bicarbonate and/or carbonate. In this study we utilized pharmacological agents to target possible acquisition pathways for both Ca2+ and accumulation of carbonate in post-metamorphic, shell-laying embryos. Using whole egg mass flux measurements and ion-specific microelectrode analytical techniques, we have demonstrated that carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed hydration of CO2 is central in the acquisition of both shell-forming ions because it provides the hydrogen ions for an electrogenic vacuolar-type H+-ATPase that fuels the uptake of Ca2+ via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and possibly an electrogenic Ca2+/1H+ exchanger. Additionally, CO2 hydration provides an endogenous source of HCO –3. Thus, hydration of endogenous CO2 forms HCO –3 for calcification while hydrogen ions are excreted, contributing to continued Ca2+ uptake, as well as creating favorable alkaline internal conditions for calcification. The connections between Ca2+ and HCO\n–3 acquisition mechanisms that we describe here provide new insight into this efficient, embryonic calcification in freshwater."},{"title":"The effect of body size on the wing movements of pteropodid bats, with insights into thrust and lift production","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4110","abstract":"In this study we compared the wing kinematics of 27 bats representing six pteropodid species ranging more than 40 times in body mass (Mb=0.0278–1.152 kg), to determine whether wing posture and overall wing kinematics scaled as predicted according to theory. The smallest species flew in a wind tunnel and the other five species in a flight corridor. Seventeen kinematic markers on the midline and left side of the body were tracked in three dimensions. We used phylogenetically informed reduced major axis regression to test for allometry. We found that maximum wingspan (bmax) and maximum wing area (Smax) scaled with more positive allometry, and wing loading (Qs) with more negative allometry (bmax∝Mb0.423; Smax∝Mb0.768; Qs∝Mb0.233) than has been reported in previous studies that were based on measurements from specimens stretched out flat on a horizontal surface. Our results suggest that larger bats open their wings more fully than small bats do in flight, and that for bats, body measurements alone cannot be used to predict the conformation of the wings in flight. Several kinematic variables, including downstroke ratio, wing stroke amplitude, stroke plane angle, wing camber and Strouhal number, did not change significantly with body size, demonstrating that many aspects of wing kinematics are similar across this range of body sizes. Whereas aerodynamic theory suggests that preferred flight speed should increase with mass, we did not observe an increase in preferred flight speed with mass. Instead, larger bats had higher lift coefficients (CL) than did small bats (CL∝Mb0.170). Also, the slope of the wingbeat period (T) to body mass regression was significantly more shallow than expected under isometry (T∝Mb0.180), and angle of attack (α) increased significantly with body mass [α∝log(Mb)7.738]. None of the bats in our study flew at constant speed, so we used multiple regression to isolate the changes in wing kinematics that correlated with changes in flight speed, horizontal acceleration and vertical acceleration. We uncovered several significant trends that were consistent among species. Our results demonstrate that for medium- to large-sized bats, the ways that bats modulate their wing kinematics to produce thrust and lift over the course of a wingbeat cycle are independent of body size."},{"title":"Population differences in fever and sickness behaviors in a wild passerine: a role for cytokines","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4099","abstract":"Immune responses benefit hosts by clearing pathogens, but they also incur physiological costs and tissue damage. While wild animals differ in how they balance these costs and benefits, the physiological mechanisms underlying such differential investment in immunity remain unknown. Uncovering these mechanisms is crucial to determining how and where selection acts to shape immunological defense. Among free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) in western North America, sickness-induced lethargy and fever are more pronounced in Southern California than in Washington and Alaska. We brought song sparrows from two populations (Southern California and Washington) into captivity to determine whether these differences persist in a common environment and what physiological signals facilitate such differences. As in free-living sparrows, captive California birds exhibited more pronounced fever and lethargy than Washington birds in response to lipopolysaccharide, a non-pathogenic antigen that mimics bacterial infection. After treatment, the two populations showed similar reductions in luteinizing hormone levels, food intake and body mass, although treated birds from California lost more breast muscle tissue than treated birds from Washington. Moreover, California birds displayed higher bioactivity of interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and marginally higher levels of corticosterone, a steroid hormone involved in stress, metabolism and regulating inflammatory responses. Our results show that immunological differences between these populations cannot be explained by immediate environment alone and may reflect genetic, maternal or early-life effects. Additionally, they suggest that cytokines play a role in shaping immunological variation among wild vertebrates."},{"title":"The effects of arm swing on human gait stability","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/3945","abstract":"Arm swing during human gait has been shown to reduce both angular momentum about the vertical and energy expenditure, and has been hypothesized to enhance gait stability. To examine this hypothesis, we studied the effect of arm swing on the local and global stability of steady-state gait, as well as the ability to perform adequate recovery actions following a perturbation. Trunk kinematics of 11 male subjects was measured in treadmill walking with normal and with restricted arm swing. In half of the trials, gait was perturbed by a position-controlled forward pull to the trunk. We constructed state spaces using data recorded from the unperturbed steady-state walking trials, and quantified local gait stability by calculating maximum Lyapunov exponents. In addition, we analyzed perturbation forces, the distance from the unperturbed gait pattern, and the return toward the normal gait pattern following an external perturbation. Walking without arm swing led to a non-significantly lower Lyapunov exponent (P=0.06), significantly higher perturbation forces (P<0.05), and significantly slower movements away from the attractor (P<0.01). These results suggest that gait without arm swing is characterized by similar local stability to gait with arm swing and a higher perturbation resistance. However, return towards the normal gait pattern was significantly slower (P<0.05) when walking with restricted arms, suggesting that the arms play an important role in the recovery from a perturbation. Collectively, the results suggest that arm swing as such does not enhance gait stability, but rather that recovery movements of the arms contribute to the overall stability of human gait."},{"title":"Night vision by cuttlefish enables changeable camouflage","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/3953","abstract":"Because visual predation occurs day and night, many predators must have good night vision. Prey therefore exhibit antipredator behaviours in very dim light. In the field, the giant Australian cuttlefish (Sepia apama) assumes camouflaged body patterns at night, each tailored to its immediate environment. However, the question of whether cuttlefish have the perceptual capability to change their camouflage at night (as they do in day) has not been addressed. In this study, we: (1) monitored the camouflage patterns of Sepia officinalis during the transition from daytime to night-time using a natural daylight cycle and (2) tested whether cuttlefish on a particular artificial substrate change their camouflage body patterns when the substrate is changed under dim light (down to starlight, 0.003 lux) in a controlled light field in a dark room setting. We found that cuttlefish camouflage patterns are indeed adaptable at night: animals responded to a change in their visual environment with the appropriate body pattern change. Whether to deceive their prey or predators, cuttlefish use their excellent night vision to perform adaptive camouflage in dim light."},{"title":"Diel foraging behavior of gravid leatherback sea turtles in deep waters of the Caribbean Sea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/3961","abstract":"It is generally assumed that leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), like other species of sea turtle, do not feed while offshore from nesting beaches, and rely instead on fat reserves to fuel reproductive activities. Recent studies, however, provide evidence that leatherbacks may forage during the internesting interval while offshore in the Western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Bio-logging technology was used to investigate the foraging behavior of female leatherback turtles at St Croix, US Virgin Islands. Leatherback gastrointestinal tract temperatures (TGT) were analyzed for sudden fluctuations indicative of ingestions, and laboratory ingestion simulations were used to characterize temperature fluctuations associated with ingestion of prey versus seawater. Dive patterns associated with prey ingestion were characterized and the proportion of prey ingestion during the day (05:00–18:59 h) and night (19:00–04:59 h) were compared. A combined total of 111 prey ingestions for seven leatherback turtles were documented during the internesting interval. The number of prey ingestions ranged from six to 48 for individual turtles, and the majority (87.4%) of these events occurred during the daytime. Prey ingestions were most frequently associated with V-shaped dives, and the mean (±1 s.d.) maximum dive depth with prey ingestion ranged from 154±51 to 232±101 m for individual turtles. Although leatherbacks were found to opportunistically feed during the internesting interval, the low prey ingestion rates indicate that energy reserves acquired prior to the breeding season are critical for successful reproduction by leatherbacks from the St Croix, USVI nesting population."},{"title":"Chemo-accumulation without changes in membrane potential in the microstome form of the ciliate Tetrahymena vorax","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/3980","abstract":"The swimming behaviour of ciliates is mainly determined by membrane potential and transmembrane fluxes. In a chemical gradient, swimming ciliates may approach or move away from the source. Based on experiments on Paramecium, it is generally assumed that chemical attractants and repellents affect the swimming behaviour of ciliates by specific changes in the membrane potential. We have examined whether there is a causal relationship between membrane potential and chemo-accumulation in the microstome form of the polymorphic ciliate Tetrahymena vorax. Effects of chemo-attractants on the membrane potential of Tetrahymena have not been previously reported. Microstome T. vorax cells aggregated close to a point source of l-cysteine and the complex meat hydrolysate proteose peptone. Chemo-accumulated cells displayed a significantly higher turning frequency than control cells at a similar cell density. A concentration of 20 mmol l–1 l-cysteine did not evoke any detectable change in the membrane potential whereas 1% proteose peptone depolarised the cells by ∼12 mV. This is contrary to the current model, which predicts agents that induce a moderate depolarisation to be repellents. A solution of 1% proteose peptone contains 21 mmol–1 Na+. A solution of 21 mmol–1 NaCl without organic compounds also caused ∼12 mV depolarisation but had no aggregating effect on the cells. Collectively, the electrophysiological and behavioural data indicate that chemo-accumulation in the microstome form of T. vorax is not governed obligatorily by the membrane potential. We thus suggest that the simple membrane potential model for chemokinesis in Paramecium may not be valid for T. vorax."},{"title":"The mass-specific energy cost of human walking is set by stature","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/3972","abstract":"The metabolic and mechanical requirements of walking are considered to be of fundamental importance to the health, physiological function and even the evolution of modern humans. Although walking energy expenditure and gait mechanics are clearly linked, a direct quantitative relationship has not emerged in more than a century of formal investigation. Here, on the basis of previous observations that children and smaller adult walkers expend more energy on a per kilogram basis than larger ones do, and the theory of dynamic similarity, we hypothesized that body length (or stature, Lb) explains the apparent body-size dependency of human walking economy. We measured metabolic rates and gait mechanics at six speeds from 0.4 to 1.9 m s–1 in 48 human subjects who varied by a factor of 1.5 in stature and approximately six in both age and body mass. In accordance with theoretical expectation, we found the most economical walking speeds measured (J kg–1 m–1) to be dynamically equivalent (i.e. similar U, where U=velocity2/gravity · leg length) among smaller and larger individuals. At these speeds, stride lengths were directly proportional to stature whereas the metabolic cost per stride was largely invariant (2.74±0.12 J kg–1 stride–1). The tight coupling of stature, gait mechanics and metabolic energy expenditure resulted in an inverse relationship between mass-specific transport costs and stature (Etrans/Mb∝Lb–0.95, J kg–1 m–1). We conclude that humans spanning a broad range of ages, statures and masses incur the same mass-specific metabolic cost to walk a horizontal distance equal to their stature."},{"title":"Relationship between muscle forces, joint loading and utilization of elastic strain energy in equine locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/3998","abstract":"Storage and utilization of strain energy in the elastic tissues of the distal forelimb of the horse is thought to contribute to the excellent locomotory efficiency of the animal. However, the structures that facilitate elastic energy storage may also be exposed to dangerously high forces, especially at the fastest galloping speeds. In the present study, experimental gait data were combined with a musculoskeletal model of the distal forelimb of the horse to determine muscle and joint contact loading and muscle–tendon work during the stance phase of walking, trotting and galloping. The flexor tendons spanning the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint – specifically, the superficial digital flexor (SDF), interosseus muscle (IM) and deep digital flexor (DDF) – experienced the highest forces. Peak forces normalized to body mass for the SDF were 7.3±2.1, 14.0±2.5 and 16.7±1.1 N kg–1 in walking, trotting and galloping, respectively. The contact forces transmitted by the MCP joint were higher than those acting at any other joint in the distal forelimb, reaching 20.6±2.8, 40.6±5.6 and 45.9±0.9 N kg–1 in walking, trotting and galloping, respectively. The tendons of the distal forelimb (primarily SDF and IM) contributed between 69 and 90% of the total work done by the muscles and tendons, depending on the type of gait. The tendons and joints that facilitate storage of elastic strain energy in the distal forelimb also experienced the highest loads, which may explain the high frequency of injuries observed at these sites."},{"title":"The energy budget, thermogenic capacity and behavior in Swiss mice exposed to a consecutive decrease in temperatures","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/3988","abstract":"The limitation on sustainable energy intake (SusEI) is important because it establishes the upper energetic limit on the ability of animals to disperse, survive and reproduce. However, there are still arguments about what factors impose that limitation. Thermoregulation in cold environments imposes great energy demands on small mammals. A cold-exposed animal has been suggested to be a model suitable for testing these factors. Here, we examined the changes in food intake and digestible energy intake (DEI) as measures of SusEI, thermogenic capacity and behavioral patterns in Swiss mice exposed to consecutively lower ambient temperatures from 23 to –15°C. Cold-exposed mice showed significant decreases in body mass, fat content of the carcass and body temperature, and increases in DEI compared with controls. The time spent on feeding significantly increased with decreasing temperatures, and time spent on general activity decreased following cold exposure. Resting metabolic rate, nonshivering thermogenesis and serum tri-iodothyronine levels significantly increased in mice exposed to lower temperatures in comparison with controls, whereas these thermogenic variables were not significantly different between 0 and –15°C. It might suggest that SusEI in cold exposed Swiss mice was constrained peripherally by the capacity to produce heat and also by the ability to dissipate body heat, but to a different extent. Moderate cold exposure might result in a relaxation of the heat dissipation limit (HDL), allowing the animals to increase food intake to meet cold stress. When animals are exposed to severe cold, the thermogenenic capacity might reach a ceiling, failing to compensate for the heat loss and which would finally result in lower body temperature and considerable weight loss. This might indicate that the HDL was set at a higher level than peripheral limits for Swiss mice exposed to a consecutive decrease in ambient temperatures."},{"title":"Response of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, Thunberg 1793, to pesticide exposure under experimental conditions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4010","abstract":"Pesticide run-off into the ocean represents a potential threat to marine organisms, especially bivalves living in coastal environments.

Two oyster populations exposed to different pollution levels in the wild were investigated. The pesticide concentrations used to induce stress were close to those found in the wild. In a time course experiment, the expression of three genes implicated in iron metabolism and oxidative stress as well as that of two ubiquitous stress proteins was examined. No clear regulation of gene or protein expression was found, potentially due to a low-dose effect. However, we detected a strong site- and organ-specific response to the pesticides. This study thus (1) provides insight into bivalve responses to pesticide pollution at the level of the transcriptome, which is the first level of response for organisms facing pollution, and (2) raises interesting questions concerning the importance of the sites and organs studied in the toxicogenomic field."},{"title":"Lack of prediction for high-temperature exposures enhances Drosophila place learning","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4018","abstract":"Animals receive rewards and punishments in different patterns. Sometimes stimuli or behaviors can become predictors of future good or bad events. Through learning, experienced animals can then avoid new but similar bad situations, or actively seek those conditions that give rise to good results. Not all good or bad events, however, can be accurately predicted. Interestingly, unpredicted exposure to presumed rewards or punishments can inhibit or enhance later learning, thus linking the two types of experiences. In Drosophila, place memories can be readily formed; indeed, memory was enhanced by exposing flies to high temperatures that are unpaired from place or behavioral contingencies. Whether it is the exposure to high temperatures per se or the lack of prediction about the exposure that is crucial for memory enhancement is unknown. Through yoking experiments, we show that the uncertainty about exposure to high temperatures positively biases later place memory. However, the unpredicted exposures to high temperature do not alter thermosensitivity. Thus, the uncertainty bias does not alter thermosensory processes. An unidentified system is proposed to buffer the high-temperature reinforcement information to influence place learning when accurate predictions can be identified."},{"title":"Eyes with basic dorsal and specific ventral regions in the glacial Apollo, Parnassius glacialis (Papilionidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4023","abstract":"Recent studies on butterflies have indicated that their colour vision system is almost species specific. To address the question of how this remarkable diversity evolved, we investigated the eyes of the glacial Apollo, Parnassius glacialis, a living fossil species belonging to the family Papilionidae. We identified four opsins in the Parnassius eyes – an ultraviolet- (PgUV), a blue- (PgB), and two long wavelength (PgL2, PgL3)-absorbing types – and localized their mRNAs within the retina. We thus found ommatidial heterogeneity and a clear dorso-ventral regionalization of the eye. The dorsal region consists of three basic types of ommatidia that are similar to those found in other insects, indicating that this dorsal region retains the ancestral state. In the ventral region, we identified two novel phenomena: co-expression of the opsins of the UV- and B-absorbing type in a subset of photoreceptors, and subfunctionalization of long-wavelength receptors in the distal tier as a result of differential expression of the PgL2 and PgL3 mRNAs. Interestingly, butterflies from the closely related genus Papilio (Papilionidae) have at least three long-wavelength opsins, L1–L3. The present study indicates that the duplication of L2 and L3 occurred before the Papilio lineage diverged from the rest, whereas L1 was produced from L3 in the Papilio lineage."},{"title":"The effect of fin ray flexural rigidity on the propulsive forces generated by a biorobotic fish pectoral fin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4043","abstract":"A biorobotic pectoral fin was developed and used to study how the flexural rigidities of fin rays within a highly deformable fish fin affect the fin's propulsive forces. The design of the biorobotic fin was based on a detailed analysis of the pectoral fin of the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). The biorobotic fin was made to execute the kinematics used by the biological fin during steady swimming, and to have structural properties that modeled those of the biological fin. This resulted in an engineered fin that had a similar interaction with the water as the biological fin and that created close approximations of the three-dimensional motions, flows, and forces produced by the sunfish during low speed, steady swimming. Experimental trials were conducted during which biorobotic fins of seven different stiffness configurations were flapped at frequencies from 0.5 to 2.0 Hz in flows with velocities that ranged from 0 to 270 mm s–1. During these trials, thrust and lift forces were measured, kinematics were recorded in three dimensions, and digital particle image velocimetry was used to evaluate flow hydrodynamics. The results of the trials revealed that slight changes to the fin's mechanical properties or to the operating conditions can have significant impact on the direction, magnitude and time course of the propulsive forces. In general, the magnitude of the 2-D (thrust and lift) propulsive force scaled with fin ray stiffness, and increased as the fin's flapping speed increased or as the velocity of the flow decreased."},{"title":"Ballistic movements of jumping legs implemented as variable components of cricket behaviour","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4055","abstract":"Ballistic accelerations of a limb or the whole body require special joint mechanisms in many animals.

In this joint the tendons of the antagonistic flexor and the extensor muscles attach at different distances from the pivot and the opposed lever arms form an angle of 120 deg. A 10:1 ratio of their effective lever arms at full knee flexion helps to prepare for most ballistic extensions: the tension of the extensor can reach its peak while it is restrained by flexor co-contraction. In kicks, preparatory flexion is rapid and the co-contraction terminates just before knee extensions. Therefore, mainly the stored tension of the extensor muscle accelerates the small mass of the tibia. Jumps are prepared with slower extensor–flexor co-contractions that flex both knees simultaneously and then halt to rotate both legs outward to a near horizontal level. From there, catapult extension of both knees accelerates the body, supported by continued high frequency motor activity to their tibia extensor muscles during the ongoing push-off from the substrate. Premature extension of one knee instantly takes load from the lagging leg that extends and catches up, which finally results in a straight jump. In swimming, synchronous ballistic power strokes of both hindlegs drive the tibiae on a ventral-to-posterior trajectory through the water, well coordinated with the swimming patterns of all legs. In walking, running and climbing the steps of the hindlegs range between 45 deg flexion and 125 deg extension and use non-ballistic, alternating activity of knee flexor and extensor muscles. Steep climbing requires longer bursts from the extensor tibiae muscles when they support the extended hindlegs against gravity forces when the body hangs over. All ballistic movements of cricket knees are elicited by a basic but variable motor pattern: knee flexions by co-contraction of the antagonists prepare catapult extensions with speeds and forces as required in the different behaviours."},{"title":"Plant cues for aphid navigation in vascular tissues","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4030","abstract":"The ability of aphids to detect and find sieve tubes suggests that aphids receive cues for sieve-tube recognition by taking samples. Specific natural conditions such as pH value, sugar species and concentration, viscosity, and oxygen pressure may enable sieve-tube detection. We tested the preference of Megoura viciae and Myzus persicae for potential plant-borne orientation parameters in artificial choice-chamber systems. Both species preferred sucrose (in comparison with fructose, glucose, raffinose or sorbitol) at concentrations of 15–22.5% (over a tested range of 0–22.5%) and at approximately pH 7 (over a tested range of pH 5–8). This preference matches the composition of the sieve-tube sap of their host plants. Likewise, Rhopalosiphum padi (normally found on barley plants with sucrose in the phloem sap) and Macrosiphum euphorbiae (normally found on pumpkin plants with raffinose-family oligosaccharides in the phloem sap) showed a significant preference for sucrose. In the absence of sucrose, however, M. euphorbiae strongly preferred raffinose. No clear preference for any carbohydrate was observed for Macrosiphum rosae and Aphis pomi (both normally found on plants with various amounts of sorbitol in the phloem sap). Electrical penetration graph (EPG) measurements of M. persicae feeding on artificial diets confirmed that sieve tubes are recognized solely by a combination of carbohydrate abundance and a neutral to slightly alkaline pH."},{"title":"Female choice in the red mason bee, Osmia rufa (L.) (Megachilidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/23/4065","abstract":"Females are often thought to use several cues and more than one modality in selection of a mate, possibly because they offer complementary information on a mate's suitability. In the red mason bee, Osmia rufa, we investigated the criteria a female uses to choose a mating partner. We hypothesized that the female uses male thorax vibrations and size as signs of male viability and male odor for kin discrimination and assessment of genetic relatedness. We therefore compared males that had been accepted by a female for copulation with those rejected, in terms of their size, their immediate precopulatory vibrations (using laser vibrometry), the genetic relatedness of unmated and mated pairs (using microsatellite markers) and emitted volatiles (using chemical analyses). Females showed a preference for intermediate-sized males that were slightly larger than the modal male size. Furthermore, male precopulatory vibration burst duration was significantly longer in males accepted for copulation compared with rejected males. Vibrations may indicate vigor and assure that males selected by females are metabolically active and healthy. Females preferentially copulated with males that were genetically more closely related, possibly to avoid outbreeding depression. Volatiles of the cuticular surface differed significantly between accepted and rejected males in the relative amounts of certain hydrocarbons, although the relationship between male odor and female preference was complex. Females may therefore also use differences in odor bouquet to select among males. Our investigations show that O. rufa females appear to use multiple cues in selecting a male. Future investigations are needed to demonstrate whether odor plays a role in kin recognition and how the multiple cues are integrated in mate choice by females."},{"title":"The mechanics of gravitaxis in Paramecium","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/24/4158","abstract":"An analysis of swimming patterns in the ciliate Paramecium shows that the ability to swim preferentially upwards (negative gravitaxis) is primarily the result of upwardly curving trajectories. The trajectory characteristics are consistent with those produced by mechanical orientation.

Gravikinesis may result from interactions between the propelling cilia and the sedimentary flow around the cell, and it seems unlikely that an internal physiological gravity receptor exists in Paramecium."},{"title":"Sensing the strike of a predator fish depends on the specific gravity of a prey fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3769","abstract":"The ability of a predator fish to capture a prey fish depends on the hydrodynamics of the prey and its behavioral response to the predator's strike. Despite the importance of this predator–prey interaction to the ecology and evolution of a diversity of fish, it is unclear what factors dictate a fish's ability to evade capture. The present study evaluated how the specific gravity of a prey fish's body affects the kinematics of prey capture and the signals detected by the lateral line system of the prey during the strike of a suction-feeding predator. The specific gravity of zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae was measured with high precision from recordings of terminal velocity in solutions of varying density. This novel method found that specific gravity decreased by ∼5% (from 1.063, N=8, to 1.011, N=35) when the swim bladder inflates. To examine the functional consequences of this change, we developed a mathematical model of the hydrodynamics of prey in the flow field created by a suction-feeding predator. This model found that the observed decrease in specific gravity due to swim bladder inflation causes an 80% reduction of the flow velocity around the prey's body. Therefore, swim bladder inflation causes a substantial reduction in the flow signal that may be sensed by the lateral line system to evade capture. These findings demonstrate that the ability of a prey fish to sense a predator depends crucially on the specific gravity of the prey."},{"title":"Biparental mucus feeding: a unique example of parental care in an Amazonian cichlid","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3787","abstract":"Vertebrates display a wide variety of parental care behaviours, including the guarding of offspring pre and post nutritional independence as well as the direct provision of nutrients during the early development period. The Amazonian cichlid Symphysodon spp. (discus fish) is unusual among fish species, in that both parents provide offspring with mucus secretions to feed from after hatching. This extensive provision of care, which can last up to a month, imposes a physiological demand on both parents and gives rise to conflict between the parent and offspring. Here, we investigated the relationship between parents and offspring during a breeding cycle, determining both mucus composition (total protein, cortisol, immunoglobulin, and Na+, K+ and Ca2+ concentrations) and the behavioural dynamics of the parent–offspring relationship. Over the course of a breeding cycle, a significant increase in offspring bite rate was recorded, with a concomitant increase in the frequency of turns the male and female parent took at caring for their young. A peak in mucus antibody provision was seen as offspring reached the free-swimming stage, suggesting a role analogous to colostrum provision in mammals. Mucus protein content was lowest during the second and third weeks of free swimming, and a weaning period, similar to that seen in mammalian parental care, occurred when the offspring had been free swimming for ∼3 weeks. In many ways, the parental behaviour of discus fish is more similar to mammalian and avian parental care than other fish species, and represents an exciting aquatic model for studying the parent–offspring conflict."},{"title":"Effect of different glycaemic conditions on gene expression of neuropeptides involved in control of food intake in rainbow trout; interaction with stress","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3858","abstract":"To assess mechanisms relating to food intake and glucosensing in fish, and their interaction with stress, we evaluated changes in the expression of orexigenic (NPY) and anorexigenic (POMC, CART and CRF) peptides in central glucosensing areas (hypothalamus and hindbrain) of rainbow trout subjected to normoglycaemic (control), hypoglycaemic (4 mg insulin kg–1) or hyperglycaemic (500 mg glucose kg–1) conditions for 6 h under normal stocking density (NSD; 10 kg fish mass m–3) or under stress conditions induced by high stocking density (HSD; 70 kg fish mass m–3). Hyperglycaemic NSD conditions resulted in decreased mRNA levels of NPY and increased levels of CART and POMC in the hypothalamus as well as increased mRNA levels of CART and CRF in the hindbrain compared with hypo- and normoglycaemic conditions. HSD conditions in normoglycaemic fish induced marked changes in the expression of all peptides assessed: mRNA levels of NPY and CRF increased and mRNA levels of POMC and CART decreased in the hypothalamus, whereas the expression of all four peptides (NPY, POMC, CART and CRF) decreased in the hindbrain. Furthermore, HSD conditions altered the response to changes in glycaemia of NPY and POMC expression in the hypothalamus and CART expression in the hypothalamus and the hindbrain. The results are discussed in the context of food intake regulation by glucosensor systems and their interaction with stress in fish."},{"title":"Long-term effects of the trehalase inhibitor trehazolin on trehalase activity in locust flight muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3852","abstract":"Trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28) hydrolyzes the main haemolymph sugar of insects, trehalose, into the essential cellular substrate glucose. Trehalase in locust flight muscle is bound to membranes that appear in the microsomal fraction upon tissue fractionation, but the exact location in vivo has remained elusive. Trehalase has been proposed to be regulated by a novel type of activity control that is based on the reversible transformation of a latent (inactive) form into an overt (active) form. Most trehalase activity from saline-injected controls was membrane-bound (95%) and comprised an overt form (∼25%) and a latent form (75%). Latent trehalase could be assayed only after the integrity of membranes had been destroyed. Trehazolin, a potent tight-binding inhibitor of trehalase, is confined to the extracellular space and has been used as a tool to gather information on the relationship between latent and overt trehalase. Trehazolin was injected into the haemolymph of locusts, and the trehalase activity of the flight muscle was determined at different times over a 30-day period. Total trehalase activity in locust flight muscle was markedly inhibited during the first half of the interval, but reappeared during the second half. Inhibition of the overt form preceded inhibition of the latent form, and the time course suggested a reversible precursor–product relation (cycling) between the two forms. The results support the working hypothesis that trehalase functions as an ectoenzyme, the activity of which is regulated by reversible transformation of latent into overt trehalase."},{"title":"Vocal power and pressure–flow relationships in excised tiger larynges","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3866","abstract":"Despite the functional importance of loud, low-pitched vocalizations in big cats of the genus Panthera, little is known about the physics and physiology of the mechanisms producing such calls. We investigated laryngeal sound production in the laboratory using an excised-larynx setup combined with sound-level measurements and pressure–flow instrumentation. The larynges of five tigers (three Siberian or Amur, one generic non-pedigreed tiger with Bengal ancestry and one Sumatran), which had died of natural causes, were provided by Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo over a five-year period. Anatomical investigation indicated the presence of both a rigid cartilaginous plate in the arytenoid portion of the glottis, and a vocal fold fused with a ventricular fold. Both of these features have been confusingly termed ‘vocal pads’ in the previous literature. We successfully induced phonation in all of these larynges. Our results showed that aerodynamic power in the glottis was of the order of 1.0 W for all specimens, acoustic power radiated (without a vocal tract) was of the order of 0.1 mW, and fundamental frequency ranged between 20 and 100 Hz when a lung pressure in the range of 0–2.0 kPa was applied. The mean glottal airflow increased to the order of 1.0 l s–1 per 1.0 kPa of pressure, which is predictable from scaling human and canine larynges by glottal length and vibrational amplitude. Phonation threshold pressure was remarkably low, on the order of 0.3 kPa, which is lower than for human and canine larynges phonated without a vocal tract. Our results indicate that a vocal fold length approximately three times greater than that of humans is predictive of the low fundamental frequency, and the extraordinarily flat and broad medial surface of the vocal folds is predictive of the low phonation threshold pressure."},{"title":"Regulation of conduction velocity in axons from near-field receptors of the crayfish antennule","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3778","abstract":"The antennular flagella of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii each possess a linear array of near-field receptors, termed standing feathered sensilla, that are extremely sensitive to movement of the surrounding water. Previously it had been shown that, within each flagellum, the axonal conduction velocity of the sensory neuron pair associated with each feathered sensillum was linearly related to the position of the sensillum along the flagellar axis. In the current studies I show that the conduction velocity of axons within the proximal three segments of the antennules, between the flagellum and the brain, is somewhat higher than the corresponding conduction velocity of the same axons in the flagellum, especially for those whose flagellar conduction velocity is between 1 and 3 m s–1, even though there is no net change in axonal diameter within this part of the afferent pathway. One consequence of this change in axonal conduction properties is an effective compression of the temporal spread – potentially by as much as tenfold – which otherwise would occur in arrival times of initial spikes from each sensillum following a mechanical stimulus to the antennule. Furthermore, the pattern signature of initial spike volleys at the brain following a global hydrodynamic stimulus to the flagellum is remarkably consistent and conceivably could be recognized as such by central processing centers. I conclude that conduction velocity adjustments improve temporal summation and resolution from input volleys that originate in the highly sensitive and, hence, inherently noisy near-field receptors, thereby more effectively triggering startle response circuitry at the approach of potential predators."},{"title":"Pulse sound generation, anterior swim bladder buckling and associated muscle activity in the pyramid butterflyfish, Hemitaurichthys polylepis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3881","abstract":"Acoustic behaviors are widespread among diverse fish taxa but mechanisms of sound production are known from relatively few species, vary widely and convergent mechanisms are poorly known. We examined the sound production mechanism in the pyramid butterflyfish, Hemitaurichthys polylepis, a member of the socially and ecologically diverse reef fish family Chaetodontidae. In the field, fish produce pulse trains at dusk during social interactions that are probably related to mate attraction and courtship. In laboratory experiments, sound production was synchronized to high-speed video to determine body movement associated with sound generation. In addition, electromyography (EMG) recordings tested the activity of six candidate muscles. Fish produced individual pulses with a mean peak frequency of 97 Hz in rapid succession. EMG experiments show that anterior hypaxial muscles contract at high bilaterally synchronous rates (up to 120 Hz) in near perfect association with rapid inward buckling visible outside the body over the anterior swim bladder. Muscle activity often showed EMG doublets that occurred within the time of a single sound pulse but was not sustained. Buckling and sound pulse rates correlated strongly (R2≈1.00) and sound pulse rate measured over two successive pulses (maximum of 38 pulses s–1) was lower than muscle firing rate. These results show that the extrinsic swim bladder muscles of pyramid butterflyfish involve single contractions that produce pulses in a manner similar to distantly related teleosts, but involve a novel doublet motor-neuron firing pattern. Thus, the sound production mechanism in pyramid butterflyfish is likely convergent with several percomorph taxa and divergent from the related chaetodontid genus Forcipiger."},{"title":"Measuring foraging activity in a deep-diving bird: comparing wiggles, oesophageal temperatures and beak-opening angles as proxies of feeding","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3874","abstract":"Quantification of prey consumption by marine predators is key to understanding the organisation of ecosystems. This especially concerns penguins, which are major consumers of southern food webs. As direct observation of their feeding activity is not possible, several indirect methods have been developed that take advantage of miniaturised data logging technology, most commonly: detection of (i) anomalies in diving profiles (wiggles), (ii) drops in oesophageal temperature and (iii) the opening of mouth parts (recorded with a Hall sensor). In the present study, we used these three techniques to compare their validity and obtain information about the feeding activity of two free-ranging king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus). Crucially, and for the first time, two types of beak-opening events were identified. Type A was believed to correspond to failed prey-capture attempts and type B to successful attempts, because, in nearly all cases, only type B was followed by a drop in oesophageal temperature. The number of beak-opening events, oesophageal temperature drops and wiggles per dive were all correlated. However, for a given dive, the number of wiggles and oesophageal temperature drops were lower than the number of beak-opening events. Our results suggest that recording beak opening is a very accurate method for detecting prey ingestions by diving seabirds at a fine scale. However, these advantages are counterbalanced by the difficulty, and hence potential adverse effects, of instrumenting birds with the necessary sensor/magnet, which is in contrast to the less accurate but more practicable methods of measuring dive profiles or, to a lesser extent, oesophageal temperature."},{"title":"Prey type, vibrations and handling interactively influence spider silk expression","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3906","abstract":"The chemical and mechanical properties of spider major ampullate (MA) silks vary in response to different prey, mostly via differential expression of two genes – MaSp1 and MaSp2 – although the spinning process exerts additional influence over the mechanical properties of silk. The prey cues that initiate differential gene expression are unknown. Prey nutrients, vibratory stimuli and handling have been suggested to be influential. We performed experiments to decouple the vibratory stimuli and handling associated with high and low kinetic energy prey (crickets vs flies) from their prey nutrients to test the relative influence of each as inducers of silk protein expression in the orb web spider Nephila pilipes. We found that the MA silks from spiders feeding on live crickets had greater percentages of glutamine, serine, alanine and glycine than those from spiders feeding on live flies. Proline composition of the silks was unaffected by feeding treatment. Increases in alanine and glycine in the MA silks of the live-cricket-feeding spiders indicate a probable increase in MaSp1 gene expression. The amino acid compositions of N. pilipes feeding on crickets with fly stimuli and N. pilipes feeding on flies with cricket stimuli did not differ from each other or from pre-treatment responses, so these feeding treatments did not induce differential MaSp expression. Our results indicate that cricket vibratory stimuli and handling interact with nutrients to induce N. pilipes to adjust their gene expression to produce webs with mechanical properties appropriate for the retention of this prey. This shows that spiders can genetically alter their silk chemical compositions and, presumably, mechanical properties upon exposure to different prey types. The lack of any change in proline composition with feeding treatment in N. pilipes suggests that the MaSp model determined for Nephila clavipes is not universally applicable to all Nephila."},{"title":"Differential adjustment in gill Na+/K+- and V-ATPase activities and transporter mRNA expression during osmoregulatory acclimation in the cinnamon shrimp Macrobrachium amazonicum (Decapoda, Palaemonidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3894","abstract":"We evaluate osmotic and chloride (Cl–) regulatory capability in the diadromous shrimp Macrobrachium amazonicum, and the accompanying alterations in hemolymph osmolality and [Cl–], gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and expression of gill Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit and V-ATPase B subunit mRNA during salinity (S) acclimation. We also characterize V-ATPase kinetics and the organization of transport-related membrane systems in the gill epithelium. Macrobrachium amazonicum strongly hyper-regulates hemolymph osmolality and [Cl–] in freshwater and in salinities up to 25‰ S. During a 10-day acclimation period to 25‰ S, hemolymph became isosmotic and hypo-chloremic after 5 days, [Cl–] alone remaining hyporegulated thereafter. Gill Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit mRNA expression increased 6.5 times initial values after 1 h, then decreased to 3 to 4 times initial values by 24 h and to 1.5 times initial values after 10 days at 25‰ S. This increased expression was accompanied by a sharp decrease at 5 h then recovery of initial Na+/K+-ATPase activity within 24 h, declining again after 5 days, which suggests transient Cl– secretion. V-ATPase B-subunit mRNA expression increased 1.5-fold within 1 h, then reduced sharply to 0.3 times initial values by 5 h, and remained unchanged for the remainder of the 10-day period. V-ATPase activity dropped sharply and was negligible after a 10-day acclimation period to 21‰ S, revealing a marked downregulation of ion uptake mechanisms. The gill epithelium consists of thick, apical pillar cell flanges, the perikarya of which are coupled to an intralamellar septum. These two cell types respectively exhibit extensive apical evaginations and deep membrane invaginations, both of which are associated with numerous mitochondria, characterizing an ion transporting epithelium. These changes in Na+/K+- and V-ATPase activities and in mRNA expression during salinity acclimation appear to underpin ion uptake and Cl– secretion by the palaemonid shrimp gill."},{"title":"Short-range allelochemicals from a plant–herbivore association: a singular case of oviposition-induced synomone for an egg parasitoid","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3911","abstract":"Oviposition-induced plant synomones are semiochemical cues used by egg parasitoids during host selection, and are therefore considered important elements of plant defence.

An additive or synergistic effect due to (1) egg deposition, (2) feeding punctures and (3) chemical footprints of M. histrionica was observed. When all three phases were present, the parasitoid reacted to the induced synomone locally on the treated leaf area, at a close distance to the treated area, and on the leaf above the treated one, showing that there is also a systemic effect. When plants with host footprints combined with feeding punctures or with oviposition were tested, responses were obtained both locally and at a close distance, whereas in the remaining assays only local responses were observed. Induction time was less than 24 h, whereas signal duration was apparently related to the suitability of the host eggs, as parasitoids did not respond to plants carrying old or hatched eggs. These oviposition-induced short-range plant synomones might have an important role in the host location process after parasitoid landing on the plant, in different combinations with the host kairomones involved in the system studied here."},{"title":"The mechanics of the adhesive locomotion of terrestrial gastropods","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3920","abstract":"Research on the adhesive locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is gaining renewed interest as it provides a source of guidance for the design of soft biomimetic robots that can perform functions currently not achievable by conventional rigid vehicles. The locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is driven by a train of periodic muscle contractions (pedal waves) and relaxations (interwaves) that propagate from their tails to their heads. These ventral waves interact with a thin layer of mucus secreted by the animal that transmits propulsive forces to the ground. The exact mechanism by which these propulsive forces are generated is still a matter of controversy. Specifically, the exact role played by the complex rheological and adhesive properties of the mucus is not clear. To provide quantitative data that could shed light on this question, we use a newly developed technique to measure, with high temporal and spatial resolution, the propulsive forces that terrestrial gastropods generate while crawling on smooth flat surfaces. The traction force measurements demonstrate the importance of the finite yield stress of the mucus in generating thrust and are consistent with the surface of the ventral foot being lifted with the passage of each pedal wave. We also show that a forward propulsive force is generated beneath each stationary interwave and that this net forward component is balanced by the resistance caused by the outer rim of the ventral foot, which slides at the speed of the center of mass of the animal. Simultaneously, the animal pulls the rim laterally inward. Analysis of the traction forces reveals that the kinematics of the pedal waves is far more complex than previously thought, showing significant spatial variation (acceleration/deceleration) as the waves move from the tail to the head of the animal."},{"title":"The flow fields involved in hydrodynamic imaging by blind Mexican cave fish (Astyanax fasciatus).

Hence the fish are able to build hydrodynamic images of their surroundings. This study measured the flow fields around blind cave fish using particle image velocimetry (PIV) as they swam parallel to a wall. Computational fluid dynamics models were also used to calculate the flow fields and the stimuli to the lateral line sensory system. Our results showed that characteristic changes in the form of the flow field occurred when the fish were within approximately 0.20 body lengths (BL) of a wall. The magnitude of these changes increased steadily as the distance between the fish and the wall was reduced. When the fish were within 0.02 BL of the wall there was a change in the form of the flow field owing to the merging of the boundary layers on the body of the fish and the wall. The stimuli to the lateral line appears to be sufficient for fish to detect walls when they are 0.10 BL away (the mean distance at which they normally swim from a wall), but insufficient for the fish to detect a wall when 0.25 BL away. This suggests that the nature of the flow fields surrounding the fish are such that hydrodynamic imaging can only be used by fish to detect surfaces at short range."},{"title":"Temperature effects in articular cartilage biomechanics","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3934","abstract":"Articular cartilage is the soft tissue that covers contacting surfaces of bones in synovial joints. Cartilage is composed of chondrocytes and an extracellular matrix containing numerous biopolymers, cations and water. Healthy cartilage functions biomechanically to provide smooth and stable joint movement. Degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis involve cartilage deterioration, resulting in painful and cumbersome joint motion. Temperature is a fundamental quantity in mechanics, yet the effects of temperature on cartilage mechanical behavior are unknown. This study addressed the questions of whether cartilage stiffness and stress relaxation change with temperature. Samples of middle-zone bovine calf patellofemoral cartilage were tested in unconfined compression first at 24°C and then again after heating to 60°C. The data reveal that when temperature increases: (1) both peak and equilibrium stiffness increase by 150 and 8%, respectively, and (2) stress relaxation is faster at higher temperature, as shown by a 60% decrease in the time constant. The increases in temperature-dependent stiffness are consistent with polymeric mechanisms of matrix viscoelasticity but not with interstitial fluid flow. The changes in the time constant are consistent with a combination of both fluid flow and matrix viscoelasticity. Furthermore, we discovered a novel phenomenon: at stress-relaxation equilibrium, compressive stress increased with temperature. These data demonstrate a rich area of cartilage mechanics that has previously been unexplored and emphasize the role of polymer dynamics in cartilage viscoelasticity. Further studies of cartilage polymer dynamics may yield additional insight into mechanisms of cartilage material behavior that could improve treatments for cartilage degeneration."},{"title":"Why do colder mothers produce larger eggs? An optimality approach","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3796","abstract":"One of the more common patterns of offspring size variation is that mothers tend to produce larger offspring at lower temperatures. Whether such variation is adaptive remains unclear. Determining whether optimal offspring size differs between thermal environments provides a direct way of assessing the adaptive significance of temperature-driven variation in egg size. Here, we examined the relationship between offspring size and performance at three temperatures for several important fitness components in the zebra fish, Danio rerio. The effects of egg size on performance were highly variable among life-history stages (i.e. pre- and post-hatching) and dependent on the thermal environment; offspring size positively affected performance at some temperatures but negatively affected performance at others. When we used these data to generate a simple optimality model, the model predicted that mothers should produce the largest size offspring at the lowest temperature, offspring of intermediate size at the highest temperature and the smallest offspring at the intermediate temperature. An experimental test of these predictions showed that the rank order of observed offspring sizes produced by mothers matched our predictions. Our results suggest that mothers adaptively manipulate the size of their offspring in response to thermally driven changes in offspring performance and highlight the utility of optimality approaches for understanding offspring size variation."},{"title":"Visual physiology underlying orientation and diel behavior in the sand beach amphipod Talorchestia longicornis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3843","abstract":"Talitrid amphipods employ vision for zonal recovery behaviors on sand beaches and for entraining circadian activity rhythms. Using a hierarchy of methods, we examined visual spectral and response–intensity functions in Talorchestia longicornis, a species in which orientation and rhythm entrainment are wavelength-specific behaviors. Microspectrophotometry, electroretinogram recording and behavioral assays were used to determine visual pigments, retinal spectral sensitivity and whole-animal spectral responsivity, respectively. Diel changes in absolute sensitivity were also investigated at retinal and whole-animal levels. Two receptor spectral classes were identified, with values for visual pigment λmax of 427 and 518 nm. Retinal spectral sensitivity varied with electrode position along the distal–proximal axis. Chromatic adaptation of distal and proximal photoreceptors resulted in sensitivity peaks at 430 and 522 nm, respectively. In accordance with identified visual pigments and spectral sensitivity, T. longicornis photobehavioral responsivity covered a broad range (420–580 nm). Collectively, a dual-pigment visual system underlies wavelength-specific behavior in T. longicornis, with the short-wavelength pigment likely to be localized in the distal R5 retinular cell. While response–intensity functions did not change over the diel cycle at the retinal level, behavioral photoresponsiveness varied between day and night. At a wavelength used by T. longicornis for celestial orientation (420 nm), photobehavior was heightened at night, potentially aiding in nocturnal orientation. By contrast, at a wavelength used to entrain its circadian rhythm (520 nm) and for routine visual tasks, photobehavior was heightened during the day, and spectral sensitivity matched to the twilight spectrum, facilitating crepuscular vision and entrainment by irradiance at sunrise and sunset."},{"title":"Hypoxia stimulates lactate disposal in rainbow trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3802","abstract":"Current understanding of lactate metabolism in fish is based almost entirely on the interpretation of concentration measurements that cannot be used to infer changes in flux. The goals of this investigation were: (1) to quantify baseline lactate fluxes in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) under normoxic conditions; (2) to establish how changes in rates of lactate appearance (Ra) and disposal (Rd) account for the increase in blood lactate elicited by hypoxia; and (3) to identify the tissues responsible for lactate production. Ra and Rd lactate of rainbow trout were measured in vivo by continuous infusion of [U-14C]lactate in trout exposed to 25% O2 saturation or maintained in normoxia for 90 min. In normoxic fish, Ra lactate decreased from 18.2 to 13.1 μmol kg–1 min–1 and Rd lactate from 19.0 to 12.8. Ra and Rd were always matched, thereby maintaining a steady baseline blood lactate concentration of ∼0.8 mmol l–1. By contrast, the hypoxic fish increased blood lactate to 8.9 mmol l–1 and Ra lactate from 18.4 to 36.5 μmol kg–1 min–1. This stimulation of anaerobic glycolysis was unexpectedly accompanied by a 52% increase in Rd lactate from 19.9 to 30.3 μmol kg–1 min–1. White muscle was the main producer of lactate, which accumulated to 19.2 μmol g–1 in this tissue. This first study of non-steady-state lactate kinetics in fish shows that the increase in lactate disposal elicited by hypoxia plays a strategic role in reducing the lactate load on the circulation. Without this crucial response, blood lactate accumulation would double."},{"title":"Relationships between metabolic status, corticosterone secretion and maintenance of innate and adaptive humoral immunities in fasted re-fed mallards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3810","abstract":"The prolonged exposure of birds to environmental stressors known to affect energy status and glucocorticoid secretion may have several physiological consequences including a decrease in immunocompetence, further compromising the survival of individuals. However, the relationships between these parameters remain poorly understood. To this end, changes in body energy content, plasma corticosterone, adaptive (total plasma immunoglobulin Y; IgY) and innate (natural antibodies; NAbs) immune systems were assessed in female mallards (Anas plathyrhynchos) throughout prolonged fasts of different intensities and subsequent re-feeding. Plasma IgY and NAb scores were decreased by 36% and 50%, respectively, during phase II of fasting (protein-sparing phase) and by up to 40% and 80%, respectively, during phase III (protein-wasting phase), indicating a selective regulation of immune function. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of a trade-off between immune function and other energy-demanding activities. However, despite full repletion of fuel reserves and NAbs, only 76% of initial IgY levels were recovered, further supporting a trade-off between innate and adaptive branches of immunity. Although fasting induced significant increases in corticosterone levels to up to 6 times higher than baseline levels during phase III, baseline levels were recovered within 1 day of re-feeding. Our data do not support the hypothesis of a direct regulation of immunocompetence by corticosterone, at least during periods of energy repletion. Finally, the mismatch between the kinetics of body fuels and the two arms of the immune system during fasting and re-feeding suggests that variations in immune system components do not strictly covary with body mass under fluctuating food conditions."},{"title":"The flow fields involved in hydrodynamic imaging by blind Mexican cave fish (Astyanax fasciatus). Part I: open water and heading towards a wall","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3819","abstract":"Blind Mexican cave fish (Astyanax fasciatus) sense the presence of nearby objects by sensing changes in the water flow around their body. The information available to the fish using this hydrodynamic imaging ability depends on the properties of the flow field it generates while gliding and how this flow field is altered by the presence of objects. Here, we used particle image velocimetry to measure the flow fields around gliding blind cave fish as they moved through open water and when heading towards a wall. These measurements, combined with computational fluid dynamics models, were used to estimate the stimulus to the lateral line system of the fish. Our results showed that there was a high-pressure region around the nose of the fish, low-pressure regions corresponding to accelerated flow around the widest part of the body and a thick laminar boundary layer down the body. When approaching a wall head-on, the changes in the stimulus to the lateral line were confined to approximately the first 20% of the body. Assuming that the fish are sensitive to a certain relative change in lateral line stimuli, it was found that swimming at higher Reynolds numbers slightly decreased the distance at which the fish could detect a wall when approaching head-on, which is the opposite to what has previously been expected. However, when the effects of environmental noise are considered, swimming at higher speed may improve the signal to noise ratio of the stimulus to the lateral line."},{"title":"Posterior lymph heart function in two species of anurans: analysis based on both in vivo pressure–volume relationships by conductance manometry and ultrasound","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3710","abstract":"Rhinella marina and Lithobates catesbeianus have known differences in the capacity to mobilize lymph to stabilize blood volume following dehydration and hemorrhage. The purpose of these experiments was to assess whether there are interspecific differences in basic lymph heart functions. The end diastolic volumes of posterior lymph hearts averaged 10.8 μl kg–1 in R. marina and 7.9–10.8 μl kg–1 in L. catesbeianus by conductance manometry, and 9–32 μl kg–1 in R. marina by ultasound techniques, which correlated with body mass. Stroke volumes were approximately 20% of end diastolic volumes in both species. Peak systolic pressures and stroke work were correlated with the index of contractility (dP/dtmax) in both species. Stroke volume was correlated to stroke work but not peak systolic pressure, end diastolic volume or end diastolic pressure indicating the preload variables do not seem to determine stroke volume as would be predicted from Starling considerations of the blood heart. Renal portal elastance (end systolic pressure/stroke volume) an afterload index did not differ interspecifically, and was equivalent to values for systemic flow indices from mice of equivalent ventricular volume. These data, taken together with predictions derived from mammalian models on the effect of high resistance indicate afterload (renal portal pressure), may be important determinants of posterior lymph heart stroke volume. The shape of the pressure–volume loop is different from an idealized version previously reported, and is influenced by end diastolic volume. Our data indicate that increasing end diastolic pressure and volume can influence the loop shape but not the stroke volume. This indicates that lymph hearts do not behave in a Starling Law manner with increased preload volume."},{"title":"Decreased echolocation performance following high-frequency hearing loss in the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3717","abstract":"Toothed whales and dolphins possess a hypertrophied auditory system that allows for the production and hearing of ultrasonic signals. Although the fossil record provides information on the evolution of the auditory structures found in extant odontocetes, it cannot provide information on the evolutionary pressures leading to the hypertrophied auditory system. Investigating the effect of hearing loss may provide evidence for the reason for the development of high-frequency hearing in echolocating animals by demonstrating how high-frequency hearing assists in the functioning echolocation system. The discrimination abilities of a false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) were measured prior to and after documented high-frequency hearing loss. In 1992, the subject had good hearing and could hear at frequencies up to 100 kHz. In 2008, the subject had lost hearing at frequencies above 40 kHz. First in 1992, and then again in 2008, the subject performed an identical echolocation task, discriminating between machined hollow aluminum cylinder targets of differing wall thickness. Performances were recorded for individual target differences and compared between both experimental years. Performances on individual targets dropped between 1992 and 2008, with a maximum performance reduction of 36.1%. These data indicate that, with a loss in high-frequency hearing, there was a concomitant reduction in echolocation discrimination ability, and suggest that the development of a hypertrophied auditory system capable of hearing at ultrasonic frequencies evolved in response to pressures for fine-scale echolocation discrimination."},{"title":"Flight behaviour of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta towards unimodal and multimodal targets","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3741","abstract":"Here, we analyse the flight behaviour of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta while it approaches three different artificial flower stimuli: a clearly visible blue flower, an invisible scented flower and a flower that is both visible and scented. By tracking the moths in fine temporal detail, we find that flight towards an artificial flower differs depending on whether the stimulus is unimodal (either visual or olfactory) or multimodal (both visual and olfactory). In all three cases, the moth reduces its speed as it nears the target but the speed is higher overall when the visual stimulus is not present. Visual feedback, as well as the concentration gradient of the odour, is used to guide the moths towards the stimulus. The main difference in flight behaviour between an approach towards a visual and a multimodal stimulus is that the olfactory information makes the moths turn more rapidly towards the multimodal stimulus. We also find that moths extend their proboscises in front of a clearly visible feeder independent of whether an odour is present. In contrast, a scented transparent artificial flower only occasionally triggers this response."},{"title":"The impact of glide phases on the trackability of hydrodynamic trails in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3734","abstract":"The mystacial vibrissae of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) constitute a highly sensitive hydrodynamic receptor system enabling the seals to detect and follow hydrodynamic trails. In the wild, hydrodynamic trails, as generated by swimming fish, consist of cyclic burst-and-glide phases, associated with various differences in the physical parameters of the trail. Here, we investigated the impact of glide phases on the trackability of differently aged hydrodynamic trails in a harbour seal. As fish are not easily trained to swim certain paths with predetermined burst-and-glide phases, the respective hydrodynamic trails were generated using a remote-controlled miniature submarine. Gliding phases in hydrodynamic trails had a negative impact on the trackability when trails were 15 s old. The seal lost the generated trails more often within the transition zones, when the submarine switched from a burst to a glide moving pattern. Hydrodynamic parameter analysis (particle image velocimetry) revealed that the smaller dimensions and faster decay of hydrodynamic trails generated by the gliding submarine are responsible for the impaired success of the seal tracking the gliding phase. Furthermore, the change of gross water flow generated by the submarine from a rearwards-directed stream in the burst phase to a water flow passively dragged behind the submarine during gliding might influence the ability of the seal to follow the trail as this might cause a weaker deflection of the vibrissae. The possible ecological implications of intermittent swimming behaviour in fish for piscivorous predators are discussed."},{"title":"Sound detection by the longfin squid (Loligo pealeii) studied with auditory evoked potentials: sensitivity to low-frequency particle motion and not pressure","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3748","abstract":"Although hearing has been described for many underwater species, there is much debate regarding if and how cephalopods detect sound. Here we quantify the acoustic sensitivity of the longfin squid (Loligo pealeii) using near-field acoustic and shaker-generated acceleration stimuli. Sound field pressure and particle motion components were measured from 30 to 10,000 Hz and acceleration stimuli were measured from 20 to 1000 Hz. Responses were determined using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) with electrodes placed near the statocysts. Evoked potentials were generated by both stimuli and consisted of two wave types: (1) rapid stimulus-following waves, and (2) slower, high-amplitude waves, similar to some fish AEPs. Responses were obtained between 30 and 500 Hz with lowest thresholds between 100 and 200 Hz. At the best frequencies, AEP amplitudes were often >20 μV. Evoked potentials were extinguished at all frequencies if (1) water temperatures were less than 8°C, (2) statocysts were ablated, or (3) recording electrodes were placed in locations other than near the statocysts. Both the AEP response characteristics and the range of responses suggest that squid detect sound similarly to most fish, with the statocyst acting as an accelerometer through which squid detect the particle motion component of a sound field. The modality and frequency range indicate that squid probably detect acoustic particle motion stimuli from both predators and prey as well as low-frequency environmental sound signatures that may aid navigation."},{"title":"Nitric oxide metabolites in goldfish under normoxic and hypoxic conditions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3593","abstract":"Nitric oxide (NO), produced by nitric oxide synthases (NOS enzymes), regulates multiple physiological functions in animals. NO exerts its effects by binding to iron (Fe) of heme groups (exemplified by the activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase) and by S-nitrosylation of proteins – and it is metabolized to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrite is used as a marker for NOS activity but it is also a NO donor that can be activated by various cellular proteins under hypoxic conditions. Here, we report the first systematic study of NO metabolites (nitrite, nitrate, S-nitroso, N-nitroso and Fe-nitrosyl compounds) in multiple tissues of a non-mammalian vertebrate (goldfish) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. NO metabolites were measured in blood (plasma and red cells) and heart, brain, gill, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle, using highly sensitive reductive chemiluminescence. The severity of the chosen hypoxia levels was assessed from metabolic and respiratory variables. In normoxic goldfish, the concentrations of NO metabolites in plasma and tissues were comparable with values reported in mammals, indicative of similar NOS activity. Exposure to hypoxia [at PO2 (partial pressure of O2) values close to and below the critical PO2] for two days caused large decreases in plasma nitrite and nitrate, which suggests reduced NOS activity and increased nitrite/nitrate utilization or loss. Tissue NO metabolites were largely maintained at their tissue-specific values under hypoxia, pointing at nitrite transfer from extracellular to intracellular compartments and cellular NO generation from nitrite. The data highlights the preference of goldfish to defend intracellular NO homeostasis during hypoxia."},{"title":"The role of serotonin in the enhancement of long-term memory resulting from predator detection in Lymnaea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3603","abstract":"Serotonergic systems play important roles in modulating stress-induced arousal and vigilance behaviours. The pond snail, Lymnaea, shows multiple defensive vigilance behaviours in response to the stress associated with predator detection. Predator detection elicited by crayfish effluent (CE), increases the time to re-emerge from the shell and enhances the shadow withdrawal response. More importantly, in Lymnaea, CE enhances the ability to form long-term memory (LTM). We investigated the role of the serotonergic system in these anti-predator responses in Lymnaea. Using a serotonin-receptor antagonist, mianserin, we found that two defensive vigilance behaviours (e.g. increasing the time to re-emerge from their shell and shadow response) elicited by CE were not observed when the serotonergic system was disrupted. Also, methysergide, another serotonin antagonist, blocked the enhanced LTM formation after training in CE. Importantly, mianserin did not alter LTM formation in pond water (PW). These data suggest that a serotonergic system is activated only when Lymnaea detect a predator. When snails were trained in CE using a training procedure that in PW produces a 24-h LTM, a more persistent form of LTM (5 days) occurred. This more persistent form of LTM was abolished after mianserin treatment. Increasing 5-HT levels in the snail by the injection of 5-HT was also associated with enhanced LTM formation. Lastly, we tested whether the osphradium is implicated in CE detection and subsequent enhanced formation of LTM. Cutting the osphradial nerve to the CNS resulted in the loss of the ability to form enhanced LTM in CE. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that the serotonergic system plays a key role in modulating the predator-induced stress responses in Lymnaea."},{"title":"Arboreal locomotion in rats – the challenge of maintaining stability","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3615","abstract":"Arboreal locomotion has mainly been looked at to date in the context of investigations into the specialization of primates and other ‘arboreally adapted’ animals. The feat of moving on branches as small or smaller than the body's diameter was tested in rats (Rattus norvegicus) as they moved on horizontal poles of different diameters. The data were compared with data pertaining to terrestrial locomotion. We investigated three-dimensional kinematics and dynamics using biplanar cineradiography with simultaneous substrate reaction force (SRF) measurements. As predicted, rats flexed fore- and hindlimbs and reduced vertical forces during pole locomotion. In addition, the orientation of the mediolateral substrate reaction force resultant (SRR) and impulses switched from lateral to medial. In order to maintain stability during arboreal locomotion, lateral spine movements increased. We propose that the combination of lateral sequence gaits, similar travel speed of the animals and similar contact times, higher or similar peak vertical forces as well as similar mediolateral impulses in forelimbs and hindlimbs are typical of clawed mammals moving on thin supports. Clawed mammals and primates share the reduction of vertical oscillations and side-to-side fluctuations, a crouched posture as well as the increase in lateral spine movements. We conclude that these features are behavioral adaptations caused by the biomechanical constraints of small branch locomotion, regardless of the way they make contact with the substrate."},{"title":"Olfactory modulation of flight in Drosophila is sensitive, selective and rapid","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3625","abstract":"Freely flying Drosophila melanogaster respond to odors by increasing their flight speed and turning upwind. Both these flight behaviors can be recapitulated in a tethered fly, which permits the odor stimulus to be precisely controlled. In this study, we investigated the relationship between these behaviors and odor-evoked activity in primary sensory neurons. First, we verified that these behaviors are abolished by mutations that silence olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). We also found that antennal mechanosensors in Johnston's organ are required to guide upwind turns. Flight responses to an odor depend on the identity of the ORNs that are active, meaning that these behaviors involve odor discrimination and not just odor detection. Flight modulation can begin rapidly (within about 85 ms) after the onset of olfactory transduction. Moreover, just a handful of spikes in a single ORN type is sufficient to trigger these behaviors. Finally, we found that the upwind turn is triggered independently from the increase in wingbeat frequency, implying that ORN signals diverge to activate two independent and parallel motor commands. Together, our results show that odor-evoked flight modulations are rapid and sensitive responses to specific patterns of sensory neuron activity. This makes these behaviors a useful paradigm for studying the relationship between sensory neuron activity and behavioral decision-making in a simple and genetically tractable organism."},{"title":"The catecholamine release-inhibitory peptide catestatin (chromogranin A344-364) modulates myocardial function in fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3636","abstract":"Catestatin (CST), the 21-amino acid, cationic and hydrophobic peptide proteolytically derived from the ubiquitous chromogranin A (CgA), is an endogenous inhibitor of catecholamine release, a potent vasodilator in vivo and an anti-hypertensive agent in mammals, including humans. Recently, we discovered that CST also functions as an important negative modulator of heart performance in frog and rat. To gain an evolutionary perspective on CST cardiotropism in fish, we analysed the influence of bovine CST (CgA344-364) on the eel heart, as well as the eventual species-specific mechanisms of its myocardial action. Experiments were carried out on fresh-water eels (Anguilla anguilla L.) using an electrically paced isolated working heart preparation. Stroke volume and stroke work were used as measures of ventricular performance. Under basal conditions, CST (from 11 nmol l–1 to 165 nmol l–1) caused a concentration-dependent negative inotropism, which was abolished by inhibitors of either β1/β2 (propranolol) or β3 (SR59230) adrenergic receptors, or by Gi/o protein (PTx) or nitric oxide synthase (L-NMMA), or guanylate cyclase (ODQ) blockers. This suggests a β-adrenergic receptor-Gi/o protein-NO-cGMP-dependent mechanism. By contrast, the CST-induced cardio-suppression was not influenced by atropine, unspecific muscarinic antagonist, thus excluding cholinergic receptor involvement. CST also counteracted the adrenergic (isoproterenol)-mediated positive inotropism. Under increased preload (i.e. Frank–Starling response) conditions, CST induced a significant increase of the Frank–Starling response, which was blocked by L-NMMA and thapsigargin, but independent from guanylate cyclase. In conclusion, this is the first report in fish that CST modulates myocardial performance under basal, as well as under increased preload, conditions and counteracts the adrenergic-mediated positive inotropism, which strikingly supports the evolutionary significance and establishes the cardioactive role of this peptide."},{"title":"Green fluorescent protein regulation in the coral Acropora yongei during photoacclimation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3644","abstract":"Reef-building corals inhabit high light environments and are dependent on photosynthetic endosymbiotic dinoflagellates for nutrition. While photoacclimation responses of the dinoflagellates to changes in illumination are well understood, host photoacclimation strategies are poorly known. This study investigated fluorescent protein expression in the shallow-water coral Acropora yongei during a 30 day laboratory photoacclimation experiment in the context of its dinoflagellate symbionts. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) concentration measured by Western blotting changed reversibly with light intensity. The first 15 days of the photoacclimation experiment led to a ∼1.6 times increase in GFP concentration for high light corals (900 μmol quanta m–2 s–1) and a ∼4 times decrease in GFP concentration for low light corals (30 μmol quanta m–2 s–1) compared with medium light corals (300 μmol quanta m–2 s–1). Green fluorescence increased ∼1.9 times in high light corals and decreased ∼1.9 times in low light corals compared with medium light corals. GFP concentration and green fluorescence intensity were significantly correlated. Typical photoacclimation responses in the dinoflagellates were observed including changes in density, photosynthetic pigment concentration and photosynthetic efficiency. Although fluorescent proteins are ubiquitous and abundant in scleractinian corals, their functions remain ambiguous. These results suggest that scleractinian corals regulate GFP to modulate the internal light environment and support the hypothesis that GFP has a photoprotective function. The success of photoprotection and photoacclimation strategies, in addition to stress responses, will be critical to the fate of scleractinian corals exposed to climate change and other stressors."},{"title":"The consequences of reversible gill remodelling on ammonia excretion in goldfish (Carassius auratus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3656","abstract":"Goldfish acclimated to cold water (e.g. 7°C) experience a marked reduction in functional lamellar surface area owing to the proliferation of an interlamellar cell mass (ILCM), a phenomenon termed gill remodelling. The goal of the present study was to assess the consequences of the reduced functional surface area on the capacity of goldfish to excrete ammonia. Despite the expected impact of ambient temperature on functional surface area, fish acclimated to 7°C and 25°C exhibited similar rates of ammonia excretion (Jnet,amm); the Q10 values for fed and starved fish were 1.07 and 1.20, respectively. To control for possible temperature-related differences in rates of endogenous ammonia production, Jnet,amm was determined at the two acclimation temperatures after loading fish with 1.12 μmol g–1 of NH4Cl. In the 3 h post-injection period, Jnet,amm was elevated to a greater extent in the 25°C fish. To estimate the potential contribution of increased ventilation and cardiac output to ammonia clearance in the warmer fish, the ammonia loading experiment was repeated on the 7°C fish immediately after they were exercised to exhaustion. The rate of excretion of ammonia was significantly increased in the exercised 7°C fish (presumably experiencing increased ventilation and cardiac output for at least some of the measurement period) suggesting that differences in external and internal convection may at least partially explain the enhanced capacity of the 25°C fish to clear the ammonia load. To more specifically assess the contribution of the different functional surface areas on the differing rates of ammonia clearance at the two acclimation temperatures, the 7°C fish were exposed for 7 days to hypoxia (PO2=10 mmHg=1.33 kPa), a treatment known to cause the disappearance of the ILCM. The results demonstrated that the hypoxia-associated loss of the ILCM was accompanied by a significant increase in the rate of ammonia clearance in the 7°C fish when returned to normoxic conditions. To determine whether compensatory changes in the ammonia transporting proteins might be contributing to sustaining Jnet,amm under conditions of reduced functional lamellar surface area, the relative expression and branchial distribution of four Rh proteins were assessed by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Although the relative expression of the Rh proteins was unaffected by acclimation temperature, there did appear to be a change in the spatial distribution of Rhag, Rhbg and Rhcg1. Specifically, these three Rh proteins (and to a lesser extent Rhcg2) appeared to localize in cells on the outer edge of the ILCM that were enriched with Na+/K+-ATPase. Thus, we suggest that despite the impediment to ammonia excretion imposed by the ILCM, goldfish acclimated to 7°C are able to sustain normal rates of excretion owing to the redistribution of ammonia transporting cells."},{"title":"The control of breathing in goldfish (Carassius auratus) experiencing thermally induced gill remodelling","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3666","abstract":"At temperatures below 15°C the gill lamellae of goldfish (Carassius auratus) are largely covered by an interlamellar cell mass (ILCM) which decreases the functional surface area of the gill. The presence of the ILCM in goldfish acclimated to cold water conceivably could lead to a covering of the neuroepithelial cells (NECs), which are believed to be important for sensing ambient O2 and CO2 levels. In this study we tested the hypothesis that goldfish with covered lamellae (and presumably fewer NECs exposed to the water) exhibit a decreased capacity to hyperventilate in response to hypoxic stimuli. Measurements of ventilation amplitude and frequency were performed during exposure to acute hypoxia (PwO2=30 mmHg) or following injections of the O2 chemoreceptor stimulant NaCN into the buccal cavity or caudal vein of fish acclimated to 25°C (uncovered lamellae) or 7°C (covered lamellae) to stimulate predominantly the externally or internally oriented NECs, respectively. The results demonstrated no significant differences in the response to hypoxia, with each group exhibiting similar percentage increases in ventilation amplitude (90–91%) and frequency (34–43%). Similarly, with the exception of a rightward shift of the ventilation frequency dose–response in the fish acclimated to 7°C, there were no significant differences between the two groups of fish in the ED50 values. These findings suggest that goldfish with covered lamellae retain the capacity to sense external hypoxic stimuli. Using immunohistochemistry to identify serotonin-enriched NECs, it was demonstrated that the presence of the ILCM results in the NECs being redistributed towards the distal regions of the lamellae. In 25°C-acclimated fish, the NECs were distributed evenly along the length of the lamellae with 53±3% of them in the distal half, whereas in fish acclimated to 7°C, 83±5% of the NECs were confined to the distal half. Using the neuronal marker antibody ZN-12, it was demonstrated that the NECs at the distal edges of the lamellae are innervated by nerve fibres. Thus, it is hypothesised that the capacity to sense external hypoxic stimuli in goldfish acclimated to cold water is maintained despite the increasing coverage of the gill epithelial surfaces because of a redistribution of innervated NECs to the exposed distal regions of the lamellae."},{"title":"Look and touch: multimodal sensory control of flower inspection movements in the nocturnal hawkmoth Manduca sexta","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3676","abstract":"A crucial stage in the interaction between pollinators and plants is the moment of physical contact between them, known as flower inspection, or handling. Floral guides – conspicuous colour markings, or structural features of flower corollas – have been shown to be important in the inspecting behaviour of many insects, particularly in diurnal species. For the nocturnal hawkmoth Manduca sexta tactile input has an important role in flower inspection, but there is no knowledge about the use of visual floral guides in this behaviour. I carried out a series of experiments to first, evaluate the putative role of floral guides during flower inspection and second, to explore how simultaneous tactile and visual guides could influence this behaviour. Results show that visual floral guides affect flower inspection by M. sexta. Moths confine proboscis placement to areas of higher light reflectance regardless of their chromaticity, but do not appear to show movements in any particular direction within these areas. I also recorded inspection times, finding that moths can learn to inspect flowers more efficiently when visual floral guides are available. Additionally, I found that some visual floral guides can affect the body orientation that moths adopt while hovering in front of horizontal models. Finally, when presented with flower models offering both visual and tactile guides, the former influenced proboscis placement, whereas the latter controlled proboscis movements. Results show that innate inspection behaviour is under multimodal sensory control, consistent with other components of the foraging task. Fine scale inspection movements (elicited by diverse floral traits) and the tight adjustment between the morphology of pollinators and flowers appear to be adaptively integrated, facilitating reward assessment and effective pollen transfer."},{"title":"Putative pacemakers of crayfish show clock proteins interlocked with circadian oscillations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3723","abstract":"Although the molecular mechanisms that control circadian rhythms in many animals, particularly in the fly, are well known, molecular and biochemical studies addressing the location and function of the proteins and genes contributing to the cycling of the clock in crayfish Procambarus clarkii are scarce.

Here we identified PER, TIM and CLK immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells located in the retina as well as in clusters of cells and neuropils of the optic ganglia, lateral protocerebrum and brain. Brain clusters 6, 10, 9 and 11, in particular, showed Per, Tim and Clk-like immunoreactivity at the perikarya and nucleus, and these antigens colocalized at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 and/or ZT 12. A biochemical assay demonstrated circadian functionality of Per, Tim and Clk proteins. Both in the eyestalk and in the brain, these proteins demonstrated apparent daily and circadian rhythms. The presence and colocalization of these clock proteins in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of several cells of retina, optic lobe and brain, depending on time, as well as their circadian oscillations, suggest interactions between positive and negative transcription factors and clock proteins similar to those forming the feedback loop of the canonical model proposed for different animals."},{"title":"Response properties of crayfish antennules to hydrodynamic stimuli: functional differences in the lateral and medial flagella","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3683","abstract":"Antennules have been reported to influence localization of distant food odors, sex discrimination, and agonistic and social behaviors of decapod crustaceans.

In red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii antennules, mechanosensory setae outnumber the chemosensory setae. We studied the mechanosensitivity of crayfish antennules by recording neural activities from isolated antennules in response to sinusoidal dipole stimuli. Both the lateral and the medial flagellum of the antennules responded to hydrodynamic stimuli, although the medial flagellum showed more sensitivity at frequencies higher than 60 Hz. The most dominant setae present on the stimulated site were the simple setal type. Although both lateral and medial flagella are capable of detecting chemical and hydrodynamic cues, results from neural responses, morphological observations and antennular behavior observations indicate that the lateral flagellum of P. clarkii functions as an olfactory organ whereas the medial flagellum complements as a hydrodynamic receptor. It appears that in crayfish antennular sensory processing, crayfish simultaneously use chemical and hydrodynamic information. We have compared our data with the threshold of fish lateral line to the same stimuli and we discuss probable similarities in response properties."},{"title":"Changes in materials properties explain the effects of humidity on gecko adhesion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3699","abstract":"Geckos owe their remarkable stickiness to millions of dry setae on their toes, and the mechanism of adhesion in gecko setae has been the topic of scientific scrutiny for over two centuries. Previously, we demonstrated that van der Waals forces are sufficient for strong adhesion and friction in gecko setae, and that water-based capillary adhesion is not required. However, recent studies demonstrated that adhesion increases with relative humidity (RH) and proposed that surface hydration and capillary water bridge formation is important or even necessary. In this study, we confirmed a significant effect of RH on gecko adhesion, but rejected the capillary adhesion hypothesis. While contact forces of isolated tokay gecko setal arrays increased with humidity, the increase was similar on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, inconsistent with a capillary mechanism. Contact forces increased with RH even at high shear rates, where capillary bridge formation is too slow to affect adhesion. How then can a humidity-related increase in adhesion and friction be explained? The effect of RH on the mechanical properties of setal β-keratin has escaped consideration until now. We discovered that an increase in RH softens setae and increases viscoelastic damping, which increases adhesion. Changes in setal materials properties, not capillary forces, fully explain humidity-enhanced adhesion, and van der Waals forces remain the only empirically supported mechanism of adhesion in geckos."},{"title":"Cardiac responses to anoxia in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3692","abstract":"In the absence of any previous study of the cardiac status of hagfishes during prolonged anoxia and because of their propensity for oxygen-depleted environments, the present study tested the hypothesis that the Pacific hagfish Eptatretus stoutii maintains cardiac performance during prolonged anoxia. Heart rate was halved from the routine value of 10.4±1.3 beats min–1 by the sixth hour of an anoxic period and then remained stable for a further 30 h. Cardiac stroke volume increased from routine (1.3±0.1 ml kg–1) to partially compensate the anoxic bradycardia, such that cardiac output decreased by only 33% from the routine value of 12.3±0.9 ml min–1 kg–1. Cardiac power output decreased by only 25% from the routine value of 0.26±0.02 mW g–1. During recovery from prolonged anoxia, cardiac output and heart rate increased to peak values within 1.5 h. Thus, the Pacific hagfish should be acknowledged as hypoxic tolerant in terms of its ability to maintain around 70% of their normoxic cardiac performance during prolonged anoxia. This is only the second fish species to be so classified."},{"title":"Zebrafish take their cue from temperature but not photoperiod for the seasonal plasticity of thermal performance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/21/3705","abstract":"Organisms adjust to seasonal variability in the environment by responding to cues that indicate environmental change. As most studies of seasonal phenotypic plasticity test only the effect of a single environmental cue, how animals may integrate information from multiple cues to fine-tune plastic responses remains largely unknown. We examined the interaction between correlated (seasonally matching) and conflicting (seasonally opposite) temperature and photoperiod cues on the acclimation of performance traits in male zebrafish, Danio rerio. We acclimated fish for 8 weeks and then tested the change in thermal dependence of maximum burst swimming and feeding rate between 8 and 38°C. We predicted that correlated environmental cues should induce a greater acclimation response than uncorrelated cues. However, we found that only temperature was important for the seasonal acclimation of performance traits in zebrafish. Thermal acclimation shifted the thermal performance curve of both traits. For maximum burst swimming, performance increased for each group near the acclimation temperature and reduced in environments that were far from their acclimation temperature. The feeding rate of cold-acclimated zebrafish was reduced across the test temperature range compared with that of warm-acclimated fish. Our study is the first that has found no effect of the covariation between temperature and photoperiod acclimation cues on locomotor performance in fishes. Our results support the intuitive idea that photoperiod may be a less important seasonal cue for animals living at lower latitudes."},{"title":"Evolution of supercontraction in spider silk: structure–function relationship from tarantulas to orb-weavers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/20/3505","abstract":"Spider silk is a promising biomaterial with impressive performance. However, some spider silks also ‘supercontract’ when exposed to water, shrinking by up to ∼50% in length. Supercontraction may provide a critical mechanism to tailor silk properties, both for future synthetic silk production and by the spiders themselves. Several hypotheses are proposed for the mechanism and function of supercontraction, but they remain largely untested. In particular, supercontraction may result from a rearrangement of the GPGXX motif within the silk proteins, where G represents glycine, P proline and X is one of a small subset of amino acids. Supercontraction may prevent sagging in wet orb-webs or allow spiders to tailor silk properties for different ecological functions. Because both the molecular structures of silk proteins and how dragline is used in webs differ among species, we can test these hypotheses by comparing supercontraction of silk across diverse spider taxa. In this study we measured supercontraction in 28 spider taxa, ranging from tarantulas to orb-weaving spiders. We found that silk from all species supercontracted, except that of most tarantulas. This suggests that supercontraction evolved at least with the origin of the Araneomorphae, over 200 million years ago. We found differences in the pattern of evolution for two components of supercontraction. Stress generated during supercontraction of a restrained fiber is not associated with changes in silk structure and web architecture. By contrast, the shrink of unrestrained supercontracting fibers is higher for Orbiculariae spiders, whose silk contains high ratios of GPGXX motifs. These results support the hypothesis that supercontraction is caused by a rearrangement of GPGXX motifs in silk, and that it functions to tailor silk material properties."},{"title":"Forelimb kinematics and motor patterns of the slider turtle (Trachemys scripta) during swimming and walking: shared and novel strategies for meeting locomotor demands of water and land","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/20/3515","abstract":"Turtles use their limbs during both aquatic and terrestrial locomotion, but water and land impose dramatically different physical requirements. How must musculoskeletal function be adjusted to produce locomotion through such physically disparate habitats? We addressed this question by quantifying forelimb kinematics and muscle activity during aquatic and terrestrial locomotion in a generalized freshwater turtle, the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta), using digital high-speed video and electromyography (EMG). Comparisons of our forelimb data to previously collected data from the slider hindlimb allow us to test whether limb muscles with similar functional roles show qualitatively similar modulations of activity across habitats. The different functional demands of water and air lead to a prediction that muscle activity for limb protractors (e.g. latissimus dorsi and deltoid for the forelimb) should be greater during swimming than during walking, and activity in retractors (e.g. coracobrachialis and pectoralis for the forelimb) should be greater during walking than during swimming. Differences between aquatic and terrestrial forelimb movements are reflected in temporal modulation of muscle activity bursts between environments, and in some cases the number of EMG bursts as well. Although patterns of modulation between water and land are similar between the fore- and hindlimb in T. scripta for propulsive phase muscles (retractors), we did not find support for the predicted pattern of intensity modulation, suggesting that the functional demands of the locomotor medium alone do not dictate differences in intensity of muscle activity across habitats."},{"title":"Effects of immune supplementation and immune challenge on oxidative status and physiology in a model bird: implications for ecologists","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/20/3527","abstract":"One route to gain insight into the causes and consequences of ecological differentiation is to understand the underlying physiological mechanisms.

The first manipulation, an immune supplementation, was achieved by oral administration of lysozyme, a naturally occurring and non-specific antimicrobial enzyme.

Lysozyme supplementation intensified the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response and generated short-term oxidative and metabolic costs. We identified significant interactions between immune supplementation and immune challenge in terms of reactive oxygen metabolites, haptoglobin and oxygen consumption. Our study provides alternative interpretations of differences in oxidative and immunological indices and demonstrates that these indices can also fluctuate and interact across very short time scales, reflecting something akin to current ‘health status’ or ‘physiological condition’.

These structures are correlated with enhanced sound-pressure sensitivity and greater sensitivity at high frequencies (600–2000 Hz). However, surprisingly little is known about the potential impact of the ASB on other otolithic organs and about how auditory responses are modulated by discrete sources that change their location or orientation with respect to the ASB. In this study, saccular and lagenar nerve fiber responses and conditioned behaviors of goldfish were measured to a small, low-frequency (50 Hz) vibrating sphere (dipole) source as a function of its location along the body and its orientation with respect to the ASB. Conditioned behaviors and saccular nerve fiber activity exhibited response characteristics nearly identical to those measured from a hydrophone in the same relative position as the ASB. By contrast, response patterns from lagena fibers could not be predicted by pressure inputs to the ASB. Deflation of the ASB abolished the characteristic spatial response pattern of saccular but not lagena fibers. These results show that: (1) the lagena is not driven by ASB-mediated pressure inputs to the ear; (2) the ASB–saccule pathway dominates behavioral responsiveness, operating effectively at frequencies as low as 50 Hz; and (3) behavioral and neural (saccular) responses are strongly modulated by the position and orientation of the dipole with respect to the ASB."},{"title":"Transcriptomic responses to heat stress in invasive and native blue mussels (genus Mytilus): molecular correlates of invasive success","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/20/3548","abstract":"Invasive species are increasingly prevalent in marine ecosystems worldwide.

Extensive studies on the dermis revealed that it can adopt three different states having different mechanical properties that can be reversibly converted. These are the stiff, standard and soft states. The standard state is readily produced when a dermal piece is immersed in the sea water containing Ca2+, whereas the soft state can be produced by removal of Ca2+. A stiffening protein, tensilin, has been isolated from some sea cucumbers (Cucumaria frondosa and Holothuria leucospilota). Although tensilin converts the state of the dermis from soft to standard, it cannot convert from standard to stiff. In this study, we isolated and partially purified a novel stiffening factor from the dermis of Holothuria leucospilota. The factor stiffened the dermis in normal artificial sea water (ASW) but did not stiffen the soft dermis in Ca2+-free ASW. It also stiffened the dermis that had been converted to the standard state in Ca2+-free ASW by the action of tensilin. These results suggest that the factor produces the stiff dermis from the standard state but cannot work as a stiffener on the soft dermis. Its addition to longitudinal muscles of the sea cucumber produced no effects, suggesting that its effect is specific to the catch connective tissue. Its stiffening activity was susceptible to trypsin, meaning that it is a polypeptide, and its molecular mass estimated from gel filtration chromatography was 2.4 kDa."},{"title":"The shadow-induced withdrawal response, dermal photoreceptors, and their input to the higher-order interneuron RPeD11 in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/20/3409","abstract":"The shadow-induced withdrawal response in Lymnaea stagnalis is mediated by dermal photoreceptors located on the foot, mantle cavity, and skin around the pneumostome area.

In semi-intact preparations comprising the circumesophageal ganglia, the mantle cavity and the pneumostome, but not the foot and eyes, a light-on stimulus elicited a small short-lasting hyperpolarization and a light-off stimulus elicited a depolarization of RPeD11. We also determined that dermal photoreceptors make a monosynaptic contact with RPeD11. The dermal photoreceptor afferents course to the circumesophageal ganglia via the anal and genital nerves to the visceral ganglion, and/or via the right internal and external parietal nerves to the parietal ganglion.

Once a criterion was reached, the directional choices of ducks were recorded in four treatments presented in a random order, separated with rewarded training trials to avoid extinction. In tests in the geomagnetic field, ducks preferred the screen in the training direction (P=0.005). In the crucial tests of magnetic orientation with the magnetic field experimentally shifted by 120 deg, ducks showed a significant difference in the choice for the correct magnetic direction between treatments (P=0.002). More specifically, they chose the correct magnetic direction more often than expected by chance (P=0.03), indicating that they were deriving directional information from the magnetic field. Ducks also chose the correct magnetic direction more often than expected by chance in tests with the shifted field after the upper bill was anaesthetised with lignocaine (P=0.05) or when the right eye was covered (P=0.005), indicating that these manipulations did not impair the ability to choose the correct magnetic direction. Thus, Pekin ducks can be conditioned to magnetic directions, and the results are consistent with the hypothesis that magnetic orientation is based on a chemical magnetoreception mechanism that is not restricted to the right eye."},{"title":"Wake structure and wing kinematics: the flight of the lesser dog-faced fruit bat, Cynopterus brachyotis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/20/3427","abstract":"We investigated the detailed kinematics and wake structure of lesser dog-faced fruit bats (Cynopterus brachyotis) flying in a wind tunnel.

Paired big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, competed for a single food item in a large laboratory flight room. Their sonar beam patterns and flight paths were recorded by a microphone array and two high-speed cameras, respectively. Bats often remained in nearly classical pursuit (CP) states when one bat is following another bat. A follower can detect and anticipate the movement of the leader, while the leader has the advantage of gaining access to the prey first. Bats in the trailing position throughout the trial were more successful in accessing the prey. In this study, bats also used their sonar beam to monitor the conspecific's movement and to track the prey. Each bat tended to use its sonar beam to track the prey when it was closer to the worm than to another bat. The trailing bat often directed its sonar beam toward the leading bat in following flight. When two bats flew towards each other, they tended to direct their sonar beam axes away from each other, presumably to avoid signal jamming.

This study measured CFF in the chicken, Gallus gallus L., using four different light stimuli – white, full-spectrum (white with addition of UV), yellow (590 nm) and UV (400 nm) – and four light intensity levels, adjusted to relative cone sensitivity. The results showed significantly higher CFF values for full-spectrum compared with white light, as well as a steeper rate of increase with intensity. The presence of UV wavelengths, previously demonstrated to affect mate choice and foraging, appears to be important also for detection of rapid movement. The yellow and UV light stimuli yielded rather similar CFFs, indicating no special role for the double cone in flicker detection."},{"title":"Peripheral modulation of pheromone response by inhibitory host compound in a beetle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/19/3332","abstract":"We identified several compounds, by gas chromatographic–electroantennographic detection (GC–EAD), that were antennally active in the bark beetle Ips typographus and also abundant in beetle-attacked spruce trees. One of them, 1,8-cineole (Ci), strongly inhibited the attraction to pheromone in the field. Single-sensillum recordings (SSRs) previously showed olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) on I. typographus antennae selectively responding to Ci. All Ci neurons were found within sensilla co-inhabited by a pheromone neuron responding to cis-verbenol (cV); however, in other sensilla, the cV neuron was paired with a neuron not responding to any test odorant. We hypothesized that the colocalization of ORNs had a functional and ecological relevance. We show by SSR that Ci inhibited spontaneous activity of the cV neuron only in sensilla in which the Ci neuron was also present. Using mixtures of cV and Ci, we further show that responses to low doses (1–10 ng) of cV were significantly reduced when the colocalized Ci neuron simultaneously responded to high doses (1–10 μg) of Ci. This indicated that the response of the Ci neuron, rather than ligand–receptor interactions in the cV neuron, caused the inhibition. Moreover, cV neurons paired with Ci neurons were more sensitive to cV alone than the ones paired with the non-responding ORN. Our observations question the traditional view that ORNs within a sensillum function as independent units. The colocalization of ORNs might sharpen adaptive responses to blends of semiochemicals with different ecological significance in the olfactory landscape."},{"title":"Angiogenesis of the uterus and chorioallantois in the eastern water skink Eulamprus quoyii","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/19/3340","abstract":"We have discovered a modification of the uterus that appears to facilitate maternal-fetal communication during pregnancy in the scincid lizard Eulamprus quoyii. A vessel-dense elliptical area (VDE) on the mesometrial side of the uterus expands as the embryo grows, providing a large vascular area for physiological exchange between mother and embryo. The VDE is already developed in females with newly ovulated eggs, and is situated directly adjacent to the chorioallantois of the embryo when it develops. It is likely that signals from the early developing embryo determine the position of the VDE, as the VDE is off-centre in cases where the embryo sits obliquely in the uterus. The VDE is not a modification of the uterus over the entire chorioallantoic placenta, as the VDE is smaller than the chorioallantois after embryonic stage 33, but expansion of the VDE and growth of the chorioallantois during pregnancy are strongly correlated. The expansion of the VDE is also strongly correlated with embryonic growth and increasing embryonic oxygen demand (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/213/19/3340/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>).

Polaroid filter drums with stripes producing alternating e-vectors were rotated around free-moving animals. Polarized optomotor responses were displayed, and these responses were similar to those performed in response to a black-and-white, vertically-striped drum, whereas no responses were displayed to a plain polarizing control drum producing just a vertical e-vector. This indicates that the animals are able to see the contrast between adjacent stripes in the polarizing drum. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of functional polarization sensitivity in cuttlefish."},{"title":"Polarization sensitivity and retinal topography of the striped pyjama squid (Sepioloidea lineolata – Quoy/Gaimard 1832)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/19/3371","abstract":"Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, cuttlefish and squid) potentially possess polarization sensitivity (PS) based on photoreceptor structure, but this idea has rarely been tested behaviourally.

This species displayed strong, consistent optokinetic nystagmic eye movements in response to a drum with stripes producing e-vectors set to 0 deg, 45 deg, 90 deg and 135 deg that would only be visible to an animal with PS. This is the first behavioural demonstration of a polarized optokinetic response in any species of cephalopod. This species, which typically sits beneath the substrate surface looking upwards for potential predators and prey, possesses a dorsally shifted horizontal pupil slit.

We propose two mechanisms that would allow the locust to control tumbling during the jump. The first is that prior to the jump, locusts adjust the pitch of their body to move the center of mass closer to the intended thrust vector. The second is that contraction of the dorsolongitudinal muscles during the jump will produce torques that counter the torque produced by thrust. We found that locusts increased their take-off angle as the initial body pitch increased, and that little tumbling occurred for jumps that observed this relationship. Simulations of locust jumping demonstrated that a pitch versus take-off angle relationship that minimized tumbling in simulated jumps was similar to the relationship observed in live locusts. Locusts were strongly biased to pitch head-upward, and performed dorsiflexions far more often than ventral flexions. The direction and magnitude of tumbling could be controlled in simulations by adjusting the tension in the dorsolongitudinal muscles. These mechanisms allowed the simulations to match the data from the live animals. Control of tumbling was also found to influence the control of jump elevation. The bias to pitch head-upwards may have an evolutionary advantage when evading a predator and so make control of tumbling important for the locust."},{"title":"Behavioral and neurophysiological responses of an insect to changing ratios of constituents in host plant-derived volatile mixtures","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/19/3388","abstract":"Ratios of compounds in host plant odors fluctuate with the phenological stage of the plant. In the present study, we investigated the effect of changing ratios of host plant volatile constituents on herbivore insect attraction and olfactory information processing. We tested a synthetic mixture of bioactive peach shoot volatiles with different concentrations of one of the mixture constituents, benzonitrile, on oriental fruit moth Cydia (=Grapholita) molesta females. Y-tube olfactometer bioassays showed that female attraction to the mixture was maintained while increasing the benzonitrile level up to 100 times. Further increases led to behaviorally ineffective mixtures. Then, we recorded odor-evoked neural activity patterns in the antennal lobes, the main olfactory center of the brain, using calcium imaging. Benzonitrile-containing mixtures elicited strong activation in two glomeruli, which were found to process mixture-related information in specific ways. Activation in one glomerulus directly paralleled behavioral effects of the different ratios tested whereas a deviating pattern was noted in the other glomerulus. Our results indicate that the ratio of constituents in a volatile mixture can be varied to a certain degree without reducing female attraction. Thus, volatile blends in nature might vary quantitatively within a certain range without affecting odor-guided host location. Neurophysiological results showed that the processing of mixture-related information inside the antennal lobes is not uniform across glomeruli. Thus, final processing of this information probably takes place in higher-order brain centers."},{"title":"Source levels of echolocation signals vary in correlation with wingbeat cycle in landing big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/19/3263","abstract":"Recordings of the echolocation signals of landing big brown bats with a two-dimensional 16-microphone array revealed that the source level reduction of 7 dB per halving of distance is superimposed by a variation of up to 12 dB within single call groups emitted during the approach. This variation correlates with the wingbeat cycle. The timing of call emission correlates with call group size. First pulses of groups containing many calls are emitted earlier than first calls in groups with fewer calls or single calls. This suggests that the emission of pulse groups follows a fixed motor pattern where the information gained from the preceding pulse group determines how many calls will be emitted in the next group. Single calls and call groups are centred at the middle of the upstroke. Expiration is indicated by call emission. The pause between groups is centred at the middle of the downstroke and indicates inspiration. The hypothesis that the source level variation could be caused by changes in the subglottic pressure due to the contraction of the major flight muscles is discussed."},{"title":"Aerodynamic characteristics of flying fish in gliding flight","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/19/3269","abstract":"The flying fish (family Exocoetidae) is an exceptional marine flying vertebrate, utilizing the advantages of moving in two different media, i.e. swimming in water and flying in air. Despite some physical limitations by moving in both water and air, the flying fish has evolved to have good aerodynamic designs (such as the hypertrophied fins and cylindrical body with a ventrally flattened surface) for proficient gliding flight. Hence, the morphological and behavioral adaptations of flying fish to aerial locomotion have attracted great interest from various fields including biology and aerodynamics. Several aspects of the flight of flying fish have been determined or conjectured from previous field observations and measurements of morphometric parameters. However, the detailed measurement of wing performance associated with its morphometry for identifying the characteristics of flight in flying fish has not been performed yet. Therefore, in the present study, we directly measure the aerodynamic forces and moment on darkedged-wing flying fish (Cypselurus hiraii) models and correlated them with morphological characteristics of wing (fin). The model configurations considered are: (1) both the pectoral and pelvic fins spread out, (2) only the pectoral fins spread with the pelvic fins folded, and (3) both fins folded. The role of the pelvic fins was found to increase the lift force and lift-to-drag ratio, which is confirmed by the jet-like flow structure existing between the pectoral and pelvic fins. With both the pectoral and pelvic fins spread, the longitudinal static stability is also more enhanced than that with the pelvic fins folded. For cases 1 and 2, the lift-to-drag ratio was maximum at attack angles of around 0 deg, where the attack angle is the angle between the longitudinal body axis and the flying direction. The lift coefficient is largest at attack angles around 30∼35 deg, at which the flying fish is observed to emerge from the sea surface. From glide polar, we find that the gliding performance of flying fish is comparable to those of bird wings such as the hawk, petrel and wood duck. However, the induced drag by strong wing-tip vortices is one of the dominant drag components. Finally, we examine ground effect on the aerodynamic forces of the gliding flying fish and find that the flying fish achieves the reduction of drag and increase of lift-to-drag ratio by flying close to the sea surface."},{"title":"Alternative developmental pathways associated with diapause regulated by temperature and maternal influences in embryos of the annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/19/3280","abstract":"Embryos of the annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus enter a state of developmental arrest termed diapause as part of their normal developmental program. Diapause can occur at two distinct developmental stages in this species, termed diapause II and III. When incubated at 25°C, most embryos enter diapause II, whereas a small percentage of ‘escape’ embryos develop continuously past diapause II and enter diapause III. Control of entry into diapause II can be altered by maternal influences and the incubation environment experienced by the embryos. Young females produce a higher proportion of escape embryos than do older females. In addition, increasing the incubation temperature from 25 to 30°C induces all embryos to escape from diapause. Surprisingly, escape embryos follow a different morphological and physiological developmental trajectory than do embryos that enter diapause II. Development of anterior structures is advanced compared with that of posterior structures in escape embryos when compared with embryos that will enter diapause II. The difference in timing of development for these two trajectories is consistent with changes observed between two species but is very atypical of variation observed within a species. Importantly, the two developmental pathways diverge early in development, during the segmentation period, when, according to evolutionary theory, constraint on developmental pathways should be relatively high. The possession of alternative developmental pathways in a vertebrate embryo is a novel finding, the ecological and evolutionary importance of which is still unknown, but potentially significant in terms of life-history evolution."},{"title":"The trade-off between growth rate and locomotor performance varies with perceived time until breeding","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/19/3289","abstract":"Environmental circumstances can cause changes in early growth patterns that subsequently affect the adult phenotype. Here we investigated how different growth trajectories affected subsequent locomotor performance, and how such effects were influenced by the perceived time until the key life-history event of reproduction. Using juvenile three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus, we show that a brief period of manipulated temperature in early life (independent of food supply) caused effects on skeletal growth trajectory not only during the manipulation itself, but also during a subsequent compensatory phase. The outcome of these changes was that fish in all treatment groups reached the same average size by sexual maturity, despite having different growth patterns. However, their growth trajectory had impacts on both pre-breeding swimming endurance and its decline over the course of the breeding season, such that swimming ability was negatively correlated with skeletal growth rate during the compensation period. We also show for the first time that ‘negative compensation’ (i.e. a decelerating growth trajectory) led to an improved swimming performance compared with steadily growing controls. Replicate experiments and photoperiod manipulations, moreover, revealed that the effects of growth rate on subsequent swimming performance were greater when the perceived time until the breeding season was shorter. These results show that the costs of accelerated or decelerated growth can last well beyond the time over which growth rates differ, and are affected by the time available until an approaching life history event such as reproduction, possibly because of the time available to repair the damage."},{"title":"Paralytic activity of lysophosphatidylcholine from saliva of the waterbug Belostoma anurum","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/19/3305","abstract":"Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is a major bioactive lipid that is enzymatically generated by phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Previously, we showed that LPC is present in the saliva of the blood-sucking hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus and modulates cell-signaling pathways involved in vascular biology, which aids blood feeding. Here, we show that the saliva of the predator insect Belostoma anurum contains a large number of lipids with LPC accounting for 25% of the total phospholipids. A PLA2 enzyme likely to be involved in LPC generation was characterized. The activity of this enzyme is 5-fold higher in Belostoma saliva than in other studied hemipterans, suggesting a close association with the predator feeding habits of this insect. Belostoma employs extra-oral digestion, which allows for ingestion of larger prey than itself, including small vertebrates such as amphibians and fish. Therefore, prey immobilization during digestion is essential, and we show here that Belostoma saliva and B. anurum saliva purified LPC have paralytic activity in zebrafish. This is the first evidence that lysophospholipids might play an important role in prey immobilization, in addition to contributing to blood feeding, and might have been an evolutionary acquisition that occurred long before the appearance of hematophagy in this animal group."},{"title":"Host gender and offspring quality in a flea parasitic on a rodent","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/19/3299","abstract":"The quality of offspring produced by parent fleas (Xenopsylla ramesis) fed on either male or female rodent hosts (Meriones crassus) was studied. The emergence success, duration of development, resistance to starvation upon emergence and body size of the flea offspring were measured. It was predicted that offspring of fleas produced by parents that fed on male hosts (i) will survive better as pre-imago, (ii) will develop faster, (iii) will live longer under starvation after emergence and (iv) will be larger than offspring of fleas fed on female hosts. The emergence success of pre-imaginal fleas was relatively high, ranging from 46.9% to 100.0% and averaging 78.4±3.0%, and was not affected by host gender. The duration of development of pre-imaginal fleas depended on the gender of the host of parents and differed between male and female offspring, with female fleas developing faster. Furthermore, male fleas developed faster if their parents fed on female rather than on male hosts, whereas no difference in the duration of development between host genders was found in female fleas. The time to death under starvation did not depend on the gender of either the flea or the host. A newly emerged flea, on average, lived 31.9±1.0 days without access to food. The relationship between host gender and body size of male flea offspring was the only effect that supported the predictions. An increase in body size in male fleas could increase their mating success and, ultimately, their fitness."},{"title":"Convergence of carbohydrate-biased intake targets in caged worker honeybees fed different protein sources","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/19/3311","abstract":"The nutritional needs of bees are supplied by nectar carbohydrates and by protein and other nutrients in pollen but little is known of how bees achieve nutritional balance. Using newly emerged caged worker honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata), we investigated whether bees maintain their intake target when confined to pairs of imbalanced complementary diets varying in protein to carbohydrate (P:C) ratio. Diets were formulated using three protein sources [casein, royal jelly or Feed-Bee® (a natural pollen substitute)] and sucrose. Within each protein type, honeybees switched between complementary diets and converged on the same P:C intake target. However, this target differed between protein types: P:C ratios were 1:12, 1:14 and 1:11 on casein, royal jelly and Feed-Bee® diets, respectively. Except for an early peak in protein consumption on royal jelly diets, these strongly convergent ratios remained constant over the 14 day experiment. This is probably due to the absence of brood, reflected in relatively stable values measured for haemolymph protein concentration and hypopharyngeal gland activation in bees on Feed-Bee® diets. Performance of caged workers was also assessed in terms of survival and ovarian activation. Survival was highest on casein diets and lowest on Feed-Bee® diets but ovarian activation was highest on royal jelly diets and lowest on casein diets. This may be due to additional components in Feed-Bee® and royal jelly (e.g. fatty acids), which are needed to activate the ovaries but also reduce survival. Nutrient intake of broodless workers is directly related to their own physiological requirements, and the strong carbohydrate bias may reflect the high metabolic rate of honeybees even under resting conditions."},{"title":"Hydrodynamic pumping by serial gill arrays in the mayfly nymph Centroptilum triangulifer","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/19/3319","abstract":"Aquatic nymphs of the mayfly Centroptilum triangulifer produce ventilatory flow using a serial array of seven abdominal gill pairs that operates across a Reynolds numbers (Re) range from 2 to 22 during ontogeny. Net flow in small animals is directed ventrally and essentially parallel to the stroke plane (i.e. rowing), but net flow in large animals is directed dorsally and essentially transverse to the stroke plane (i.e. flapping). Detailed flow measurements based on Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) ensemble-correlation analysis revealed that the phasing of the gills produces a time-dependent array of vortices associated with a net ventilatory current, a fluid kinematic pattern, here termed a ‘phased vortex pump’. Absolute size of vortices does not change with increasing animal size or Re, and thus the vortex radius (Rv) decreases relative to inter-gill distance (Lis) during mayfly growth. Given that effective flapping in appendage-array animals requires organized flow between adjacent appendages, we hypothesize that rowing should be favored when Lis/Rv<1 and flapping should be favored when Lis/Rv>1. Significantly, the rowing-to-flapping transition in Centroptilum occurs at Re∼5, when the mean dynamic inter-gill distance equals the vortex radius. This result suggests that the Re-based rowing–flapping demarcation observed in appendage-array aquatic organisms may be determined by the relative size of the propulsive mechanism and its self-generated vortices."},{"title":"Spectral and polarization sensitivity of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar): phylogenetic considerations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3187","abstract":"We were interested in comparing the characteristics of polarization sensitivity in Atlantic salmon to those in Pacific salmon. Here we show that the common ancestor to the clade containing Salmo salar, Oncorhynchus mykiss, O. nerka, O. clarkii and Salvelinus fontinalis has the trait of ultraviolet polarization sensitivity. We examined spectral and polarization sensitivity of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) using both optic nerve compound action potential (CAP) and electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. Our experiments employed photic manipulation to adjust the sensitivity of the four cone mechanisms of Atlantic salmon. A spectrally broad background was used to ensure a contribution of all cone mechanisms to both spectral and polarization sensitivity. Chromatic adaptation was used to isolate the sensitivity of each of the four cone mechanisms for both spectral and polarization sensitivity. Under spectrally broad conditions, UV sensitive (UVS), mid wavelength sensitive (MWS) and long wavelength sensitive (LWS) cone mechanisms contributed to polarization sensitivity. CAP recordings produced the typical ‘W’ shaped polarization sensitivity curve reflecting two active polarization detectors with peaks at e-vector orientations of 0 deg, 90 deg and 180 deg, and troughs at 30 deg and 150 deg. ERG recordings produced a four-peaked polarization sensitivity curve reflecting two active polarization detectors and negative feedback activity, with peaks at e-vectors 0 deg, 45 deg, 90 deg, 135 deg and 180 deg, and troughs at 30 deg, 60 deg, 120 deg and 150 deg. Polarization-sensitivity measurements of isolated cone mechanisms revealed two orthogonal polarization detector mechanisms in Atlantic salmon, identical to that found in rainbow trout and other Pacific salmonid fishes. Moreover, under spectrally broad background conditions, CAP and ERG polarization sensitivity of Atlantic salmon did not differ significantly from that reported in Pacific salmonids."},{"title":"Effects of feeding on thermoregulatory behaviours and gut blood flow in white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) using biotelemetry in combination with standard techniques","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3198","abstract":"The effects of thermoregulatory behaviours on gut blood flow in white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus before and after feeding was studied using a blood flow biotelemetry system in combination with a temperature preference chamber.

Although effects of background biotic noise on mate recognition and discrimination have been widely studied in air-born sound communication, little is known about incidental interference between signallers that use substrate-borne vibrational signals. In this study we investigated the ability of males of the southern green stink bug Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) to recognize conspecific female song in the presence of biotic noise originating from conspecific and heterospecific vibrational signals. We tested male responsiveness on a bean plant in playback experiments. One leaf was vibrated with conspecific female song, while to the other one we simultaneously applied either heterospecific female signal or various altered conspecific signals with different temporal parameters. We tested males in three levels of biotic noise, ranging from +6 dB to –6 dB and we compared male responsiveness in each treatment with response obtained in unilateral treatment with unaltered conspecific female calling song. Male responsiveness was reduced in the presence of heterospecific signals or when background noise from conspecific signals obscured the species-specific temporal pattern of conspecific female song. By contrast, the presence of two sources of conspecific female songs had a positive effect on male responsiveness, for as long as the signal repetition rate of perceived song did not differ from the species-specific value. In the presence of interfering background signals, searching activity was less affected than male signalling. Increased signal-to-noise ratio restored male responsiveness to the level expressed in unilateral stimulation with conspecific female song. The results are discussed with regard to male behavioural strategies for vibrational communication in a noisy environment."},{"title":"Plasticity in extended phenotypes: orb web architectural responses to variations in prey parameters","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3207","abstract":"A spider orb web is an extended phenotype; it modifies and interacts with the environment, influencing spider physiology. Orb webs are plastic, responding to variations in prey parameters. Studies attempting to understand how nutrients influence spider orb-web plasticity have been hampered by the inability to decouple prey nutrients from other, highly correlated, prey factors and the intrinsic link between prey protein and prey energy concentration. I analyzed the nutrient concentrations of cockroaches, and adult and juvenile crickets to devise experiments that controlled prey protein concentration while varying prey size, ingested mass, energy concentration and feeding frequency of the orb web spider Argiope keyserlingi. I found that A. keyserlingi alters overall architecture according to feeding frequency. Decoration length was inversely related to ingested prey mass and/or energy density in one experiment but directly related to ingested prey mass in another. These contradictory results suggest that factors not examined in this study have a confounding influence on decoration plasticity. As decorations attract prey as well as predators decreasing decoration investment may, in some instances, be attributable to benefits no longer outweighing the risks. Web area was altered according to feeding frequency, and mesh size altered according to feeding frequency and prey length. The number of radii in orb webs was unaffected by prey parameters. A finite amount of silk can be invested in the orb web, so spiders trade-off smaller mesh size with larger web capture area, explaining why feeding frequency influenced both web area and mesh size. Mesh size is additionally responsive to prey size via sensory cues, with spiders constructing webs suitable for catching the most common or most profitable prey."},{"title":"Call properties and morphology of the sound-producing organ in Ophidion rochei (Ophidiidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3230","abstract":"The anatomical structures of the sound-producing organ in Ophidion rochei males present an important panel of highly derived characters: three pairs of putatively slow sonic muscles; a neural arch that pivots; a rocker bone at the front pole of the swimbladder; a stretchable swimbladder fenestra; a swimbladder plate; and an internal cone that terminates in a pair of membranes in the caudal swimbladder. Male courtship calls are produced nocturnally and consist of trains of 10 to 40 pulses that increase in amplitude and decrease in rate before exhibiting alternating periods of ca. 84 and 111 ms. Each pulse includes an unusual waveform with two parts. Pulse part 1 is a single cycle followed by a longer duration pulse part that exhibits gradual damping. Sounds and morphology suggest two hypotheses on the sound-producing mechanism. The ‘pulley’ hypothesis would require an alternate contraction of the ventral and dorsal muscles to form the two parts of each pulse. The ‘bow’ hypothesis involves a release mechanism with the sustained contraction of the dorsal muscle during all of the call, and the rapid contraction/relaxation of the ventral muscle to form each pulse."},{"title":"Swimming behavior and prey retention of the polychaete larvae Polydora ciliata (Johnston)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3237","abstract":"The behavior of the ubiquitous estuarine planktotrophic spionid polychaete larvae Polydora ciliata was studied. We describe ontogenetic changes in morphology, swimming speed and feeding rates and have developed a simple swimming model using low Reynolds number hydrodynamics. In the model we assumed that the ciliary swimming apparatus is primarily composed of the prototroch and secondarily by the telotroch. The model predicted swimming speeds and feeding rates that corresponded well with the measured speeds and rates. Applying empirical data to the model, we were able to explain the profound decrease in specific feeding rates and the observed increase in the difference between upward and downward swimming speeds with larval size. We estimated a critical larval length above which the buoyancy-corrected weight of the larva exceeds the propulsion force generated by the ciliary swimming apparatus and thus forces the larva to the bottom. This modeled critical larval length corresponded to approximately 1 mm, at which, according to the literature, competence for metamorphosis and no more length increase is observed. These findings may have general implications for all planktivorous polychaete larvae that feed without trailing threads. We observed bell shaped particle retention spectra with a minimum prey size of approximately 4 μm equivalent spherical diameter, and we found that an ontogenetic increase in maximum prey size add to a reduction in intra-specific food competition in the various larval stages. In a grazing experiment using natural seawater, ciliates were cleared approximately 50% more efficiently than similar sized dinoflagellates. The prey sizes retainable for P. ciliata larvae covers the microplankton fraction and includes non-motile as well as motile prey items, which is why the larvae are trophically positioned among the copepods and dinoflagellates. Not only do larval morphology and behavior govern larval feeding, prey behavior also influences the feeding efficiency of Polydora ciliata."},{"title":"Single source sound production and dynamic beam formation in echolocating harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3105","abstract":"Echolocating toothed whales produce high-powered clicks by pneumatic actuation of phonic lips in their nasal complexes. All non-physeteroid toothed whales have two pairs of phonic lips allowing many of these species to produce both whistles and clicks at the same time. That has led to the hypothesis that toothed whales can increase the power outputs and bandwidths of clicks, and enable fast clicking and beam steering by acutely timed actuation of both phonic lip pairs simultaneously. Here we test that hypothesis by applying suction cup hydrophones on the sound-producing nasal complexes of three echolocating porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) with symmetrical pairs of phonic lips. Using time of arrival differences on three hydrophones, we show that all recorded clicks from these three porpoises are produced by the right pair of phonic lips with no evidence of simultaneous or independent actuation of the left pair. It is demonstrated that porpoises, despite actuation of only one sound source, can change their output and sound beam probably through conformation changes in the sound-producing soft tissues and nasal sacs, and that the coupling of the phonic lips and the melon acts as a waveguide for sound energy between 100 and 160 kHz to generate a forward-directed sound beam for echolocation."},{"title":"Yolk testosterone shapes the expression of a melanin-based signal in great tits: an antioxidant-mediated mechanism?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3127","abstract":"Conspicuous traits produced by melanin deposition in integuments are often involved in visual communication. The information content of melanin-based signals is unclear as their expression is tightly controlled by genes and, apparently, is less dependent on individual condition. In birds, high heritabilities have been attributed to melanin-based plumages, often on the basis of egg-swapping manipulations (cross-fostering experiments). However, it is well known that female birds can differentially transfer testosterone to the egg yolk. Furthermore, high testosterone levels have been related to high oxidative stress. As we recently found that oxidative stress experienced during development influences the expression of melanin-based traits, here we manipulated the level of yolk testosterone in great tits (Parus major) to assess the influence of this maternal effect on the expression of the black breast stripe, a well-known melanin-based signal. We predicted that fledglings hatched from eggs with high testosterone levels will not only show larger black stripes but also experience changes in their antioxidant machinery. Indeed, the size of the black stripe of great tits hatched from testosterone-injected eggs was almost double that of controls. Furthermore, the same individuals showed a trend to higher levels of circulating antioxidants, which suggests an adaptive response against some testosterone-induced oxidative challenge."},{"title":"The orientation-dependent visual spatial cut-off frequency in a spider","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3111","abstract":"Cupiennius salei (Araneae, Ctenidae) has, like most spiders, eight camera-type eyes. The anterior median eyes are called principal eyes and have a movable retina; all of the other eyes are referred to as secondary eyes and are equipped with a reflecting tapetum. The photoreceptors in the secondary eyes are arranged in rows on the tapetum and the inter-receptor angle along such a row is smaller than normal to it. In this study, the vertical and horizontal spatial cut-off frequencies of moving gratings were measured for the posterior median (PM) eyes, and the data were then compared with the anatomical data reported in the literature. Detection of moving objects in the secondary eyes enhances the eye muscle potential frequency in the principal eyes. We thus recorded the eye muscle activity with a telemetric unit as a monitor for motion detection while moving stimuli – sinusoidally modulated bright and dark stripes – were presented to the PM eyes on a computer screen. A significant increase in the eye muscle activity was measured for gratings at an angular wavelength of 2.0 deg in the vertical orientation and of 2.7 deg in the horizontal direction. In the vertical orientation the critical wavelength is twice the inter-receptor angle; in the horizontal orientation the spiders responded to wavelengths that are smaller than twice the corresponding inter-receptor angle. The cut-off frequency seems thus to be limited by the visual field of the photoreceptors rather than the inter-receptor angle. The relative intensity modulations modelled for the two different grating orientations in single photoreceptor cells were in line with our data."},{"title":"Are fish less responsive to a flow stimulus when swimming?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3131","abstract":"Fish use the lateral line system to sense the water flow created by a predator's strike. Despite its potential importance to the survival of a diversity of species, it is unclear whether this ability becomes compromised when a fish swims. Therefore, the present study compared the behavioral responsiveness of swimming and motionless zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae when exposed to the flow of a suction-feeding predator. This flow was generated with an impulse chamber, which is a device that we developed to generate a repeatable stimulus with a computer-controlled servo motor. Using high-speed video recordings, we found that about three-quarters (0.76, N=121) of motionless larvae responded to the stimulus with an escape response. These larvae were 66% more likely to respond to flow directed perpendicular than flow running parallel to the body. Swimming larvae exhibited a 0.40 response probability and were therefore nearly half as likely to respond to flow as motionless larvae. However, the latency between stimulus and response was unaffected by swimming or the direction of flow. Therefore, swimming creates changes in the hydrodynamics or neurophysiology of a larval fish that diminish the probability, but not the speed, of their response to a flow stimulus. These findings demonstrate a sensory benefit to the intermittent swimming behavior observed among a broad diversity of fishes."},{"title":"Audiogram of a formerly stranded long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas) measured using auditory evoked potentials","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3138","abstract":"Long-finned pilot whales are highly social odontocetes found in temperate and subpolar regions. This species is particularly known for its interaction with fisheries as well as its mass strandings. Recent tagging work has provided some information about pilot whales in the wild but, even though they have been successfully kept in captivity, little is known about their sensory capabilities. This study investigates the hearing abilities of a rehabilitated 2 year old male long-finned pilot whale. A complete audiogram was collected using auditory evoked potential techniques that included measurements of nine frequencies from 4 to 100 kHz presented as sinusoidally amplitude-modulated tones. The results indicated that the region of best hearing was between 11.2 and 50 kHz and the subject had relatively poor high frequency hearing compared with other odontocete species. This study emphasizes the importance of collecting basic hearing measurements from new species, understanding diagnostic life histories as well as continuously increasing the sample size of audiometry measurements within and between odontocete species as animals become available."},{"title":"Sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric regulation of the gastrointestinal vasculature in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) under normal and postprandial conditions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3118","abstract":"The control of the gastrointestinal hyperemia that occurs after feeding in most animals is of fundamental importance for the subsequent absorption, metabolism and redistribution of nutrients. Yet, in fish, it has received little attention and the nature of it is far from clear. We sought to investigate the importance of extrinsic and intrinsic innervation of the gastrointestinal tract in the regulation of gastrointestinal blood flow in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The contribution of the extrinsic innervation, i.e. by the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system, was examined by comparing the response to the injection of a predigested nutrient diet into the proximal intestine of untreated fish with the response in fish in which the splanchnic and vagal innervation of the gut had been removed. We also injected the predigested nutrient diet into anaesthetized fish treated with tetrodotoxin that would block the intrinsic innervation of the gut (i.e. enteric nervous system). Our results confirm the notion that the sympathetic portion of the extrinsic innervation maintains the basal vascular tone, but neither the splanchnic nor the vagal innervation is fundamental to the postprandial hyperemia. However, the tetrodotoxin treatment completely abolished the postprandial hyperemia, indicating the importance of the enteric nervous system. In conclusion, it seems as though the enteric nervous system is essential to the regulation of the postprandial hyperemia, and that the extrinsic innervation is involved mainly in the regulation of gastrointestinal blood flow under normal conditions and in response to central coordination with other organs."},{"title":"Effects of tentacle amputation and regeneration on the morphology and activity of the olfactory center of the terrestrial slug Limax valentianus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3144","abstract":"The tentacles of pulmonates regenerate spontaneously following amputation. The regenerated tentacle is equipped with all the elements necessary for normal olfactory functioning, and the slugs can behave as well as they did before the tentacle amputation. However, it is not known what changes occur to the olfactory center procerebrum in the brain at the morphological and physiological levels. Here, we investigated the innervation of tentacular nerves into the procerebrum by examining the size of the terminal mass (input layer from tentacular nerves) of the procerebrum and also by staining afferent nerves immunohistochemically at 15, 58 and 75 days following unilateral amputation of the superior and inferior tentacles. The size of the terminal mass was significantly decreased, and the Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2ergic (FMRFamidergic) afferent nerves disappeared by 15 days following the tentacle amputation. However, the size of the terminal mass had recovered substantially by 58 days, as the tentacle regenerated. The FMRFamidergic innervation into the cerebral ganglion was also restored by this time. An extended recovery (75 days), however, did not result in any further increase in the size of the terminal mass. We also recorded the local field potential (LFP) oscillation in the procerebrum. We found that the oscillatory frequency of the LFP had decreased at 15 days following the tentacle amputation but had recovered at 58 and 75 days. These results suggest that the amputation and regrowth of the tentacle are accompanied by the respective degeneration and re-innervation of olfactory nerves, and these changes in the innervation status affect the basal state of LFP oscillation."},{"title":"AMP-activated protein kinase controls metabolism and heat production during embryonic development in birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3167","abstract":"During embryonic and early juvenile development, endotherms must balance energy allocation between growth and heat production. Failure to either match the ATP demand of growing tissue or produce heat at the correct developmental stage will lead to damage of the organism. We tested the hypothesis that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and heat production during development in the chicken (Gallus gallus). We show that mRNA concentrations of regulatory and catalytic AMPK subunits, AMPK total protein, and AMPK phosphorylation increase during development [3 days (–3 days) and one day (–1 day) before hatching, and +1 day and +8 days after hatching] in liver, and to a lesser extent in skeletal muscle. Chronic stimulation with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) significantly increases AMPK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle and in liver. This increase was paralleled by significant increases in heat production, glucose utilization, and liver and skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity (citrate synthase activity). The effects of AMPK are likely to be mediated by inhibition of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) after hatching, when ACC protein concentration increases significantly, and by a significant AMPK-induced increase in PGC-1α mRNA concentration (at +1 day), but not in NRF-1 mRNA concentration. AMPK phosphorylation is under the control of thyroid hormone, and AMPK phosphorylation decreases significantly following the induction of hypothyroidism. We propose AMPK as a principal regulatory mechanism during the transition from ectothermy to endothermy in birds, and show that AMPK function in birds is similar to that observed in mammals."},{"title":"Lymph flux rates from various lymph sacs in the cane toad Rhinella marina: an experimental evaluation of the roles of compliance, skeletal muscles and the lungs in the movement of lymph","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3161","abstract":"A new method for quantitatively determining lymph flux from various lymphatic sacs of an anuran, the cane toad, was developed. This method used the dye dilution principle of CiVi=CfVf following injection of Evans Blue into specific lymph sacs and measuring its appearance in the venous circulation. The apparent lymph volume was 57 ml kg–1. The greatest rate of lymph return (0.5–0.8 ml kg–1 min–1) and best linear fit of Evans Blue appearance in the circulation with time followed injections into the subvertebral lymph sac, which has direct connections to both the anterior and posterior pairs of lymphatic hearts. Rate of lymph flux from the pair of posterior lymph hearts was three times greater than the anterior pair. Rates of lymph flux were only influenced by injection volume in the crural lymph sacs, implicating lymph sac compliance as the source of the pressure for lymph movement from these sacs. Femoral lymph sac fluxes were decreased by 60% following ablation of the tendons of the sphincter ani cloacalis, abdominal crenators and piriformis. This supports a role for these muscles in generating the pressure for vertical lymph movement. Femoral lymph sac fluxes were also decreased by 70% by the insertion of a coil in the subvertebral lymph sac, preventing normal compression and expansion of this sac by the lungs. This supports a role for lung ventilation in generating the pressure for vertical movement of lymph. Contrary to previous hypotheses, fluxes from the brachial sac were not influenced by insertion of the coil into the subvertebral sac. A haemorrhage equivalent to 50% of the blood volume did not change lymph flux rates from the femoral lymph sacs. These data provide the first experimental evidence that actual lymph fluxes in the cane toad Rhinella marina depend on lymph sac compliance, contraction of specific skeletal muscles and lung ventilation to move lymph laterally and vertically to the dorsally located lymphatic hearts."},{"title":"Innate olfactory preferences in dung beetles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3177","abstract":"The effects of insect larval diet on adult olfactory responses to host-plant or food volatiles are still debated. The induction of adult host preferences has been studied in insects with diverse ecologies, including parasitoids, flower-visitors and phytophagous species. We investigated this question for the first time in a coprophagous insect species. Larvae of the French scarab dung beetle Agrilinus constans were reared on four different artificial substrates containing dung from cattle, horse, sheep or wild boar, and responses of imagos to dung volatiles were then behaviourally tested in an olfactometer. We also reported the first analysis of the composition of different mammal dung volatiles. We showed that adult beetles were more attracted to cattle and sheep dung odours, and that larval feeding experience had no effect on the adult olfactory responses to dung volatiles. A second experiment showed that the presence of other insects inside the dung resource affects the process of dung selection by adults. We identified 64 chemical compounds from dung emissions, and showed that dung volatiles clearly differed among different mammal species, allowing olfactory discrimination by dung beetles. Our results suggest that resource selection in coprophagous insects may be based on innate olfactory preferences. Further experiments should examine whether Agrilinus adults can learn new dung odours, and whether larval diet may influence the behaviour of adults in other coprophagous species."},{"title":"Rh glycoprotein expression is modulated in pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) during high environmental ammonia exposure","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3150","abstract":"Rhesus (Rh) protein involvement in ammonia transport processes in freshwater fish has received considerable attention; however, parallel investigations in seawater species are scant. We exposed pufferfish to high environmental ammonia (HEA; 1 and 5 mmol l–1 NH4HCO3) and evaluated the patterns of ammonia excretion and gill Rh mRNA and protein expression. Gill H+-ATPase, NHE1, NHE2, NHE3, Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), Na+/K+/2Cl– co-transporter (NKCC1) mRNA, H+-ATPase activity, NKA protein and activity, were also quantified. Activation of NKA by NH4+ was demonstrated in vitro. The downregulation of Rhbg mRNA and simultaneous upregulations of Rhcg1, H+-ATPase, NHE3, NKA, NKCC1 mRNA, H+-ATPase activity, and NKA protein and activity levels suggested that during HEA, ammonia excretion was mediated mainly by mitochondria-rich cells (MRCs) driven by NKA with basolateral NH4+ entry via NKA and/or NKCC1, and apical NH3 extrusion via Rhcg1. Reprotonation of NH3 by NHE3 and/or H+-ATPase would minimise back flux through the Rh channels. Downregulated Rhbg and Rhag mRNA observed in the gill during HEA suggests a coordinated protective response to minimise the influx of external ammonia via the pavement cells and pillar cells, respectively, while routing ammonia excretion through the MRCs. Exposure to hypercapnia (1% CO2 in air) resulted in downregulated gill and erythrocyte Rhag mRNA. Surprisingly, Rhag, Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2 proteins responded to both hypercapnia and HEA with changes in their apparent molecular masses. A dual NH3/CO2 transport function of the pufferfish Rh proteins is therefore suggested. The results support and extend an earlier proposed model of pufferfish gill ammonia excretion that was based on immunolocalisation of the Rh proteins. Passive processes and/or Rhbg and Rhcg2 in the pavement cells may maintain basal levels of plasma ammonia but elevated levels may require active excretion via NKA and Rhcg1 in the MRCs."},{"title":"Goal seeking in honeybees: matching of optic flow snapshots?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/2913","abstract":"Visual landmarks guide humans and animals including insects to a goal location. Insects, with their miniature brains, have evolved a simple strategy to find their nests or profitable food sources; they approach a goal by finding a close match between the current view and a memorised retinotopic representation of the landmark constellation around the goal. Recent implementations of such a matching scheme use raw panoramic images (‘image matching’) and show that it is well suited to work on robots and even in natural environments. However, this matching scheme works only if relevant landmarks can be detected by their contrast and texture. Therefore, we tested how honeybees perform in localising a goal if the landmarks can hardly be distinguished from the background by such cues. We recorded the honeybees' flight behaviour with high-speed cameras and compared the search behaviour with computer simulations. We show that honeybees are able to use landmarks that have the same contrast and texture as the background and suggest that the bees use relative motion cues between the landmark and the background. These cues are generated on the eyes when the bee moves in a characteristic way in the vicinity of the landmarks. This extraordinary navigation performance can be explained by a matching scheme that includes snapshots based on optic flow amplitudes (‘optic flow matching’). This new matching scheme provides a robust strategy for navigation, as it depends primarily on the depth structure of the environment."},{"title":"Switching attraction to inhibition: mating-induced reversed role of sex pheromone in an insect","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/2933","abstract":"In the moth, Agrotis ipsilon, newly mated males cease to be attracted to the female-produced sex pheromone, preventing them from re-mating until the next night, by which time they would have refilled their reproductive glands for a potential new ejaculate. The behavioural plasticity is accompanied by a decrease in neuron sensitivity within the primary olfactory centre, the antennal lobe (AL). However, it was not clear whether the lack of the sexually guided behaviour results from the absence of sex pheromone detection in the ALs, or if they ignore it in spite of detection, or if the sex pheromone itself inhibits attraction behaviour after mating. To test these hypotheses, we performed behavioural tests and intracellular recordings of AL neurons to non-pheromonal odours (flower volatiles), different doses of sex pheromone and their mixtures in virgin and newly mated males. Our results show that, although the behavioural and AL neuron responses to flower volatiles alone were similar between virgin and mated males, the behavioural response of mated males to flower odours was inhibited by adding pheromone doses above the detection threshold of central neurons. Moreover, we show that the sex pheromone becomes inhibitory by differential central processing: below a specific threshold, it is not detected within the AL; above this threshold, it becomes inhibitory, preventing newly mated males from responding even to plant odours. Mated male moths have thus evolved a strategy based on transient odour-selective central processing, which allows them to avoid the risk-taking, energy-consuming search for females and delay re-mating until the next night for a potential new ejaculate."},{"title":"Elasticity and stress relaxation of rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) vocal folds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/2924","abstract":"Fundamental frequency is an important perceptual parameter for acoustic communication in mammals. It is determined by vocal fold oscillation, which depends on the morphology and viscoelastic properties of the oscillating tissue. In this study, I tested if stress–strain and stress–relaxation behavior of rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) vocal folds allows the prediction of a species' natural fundamental frequency range across its entire vocal repertoire as well as of frequency contours within a single call type. In tensile tests, the load–strain and stress–relaxation behavior of rhesus monkey vocal folds and ventricular folds has been examined. Using the string model, predictions about the species' fundamental frequency range, individual variability, as well as the frequency contour of ‘coo’ calls were made. The low- and mid-frequency range (up to 2 kHz) of rhesus monkeys can be predicted relatively well with the string model. The discrepancy between predicted maximum fundamental frequency and what has been recorded in rhesus monkeys is currently ascribed to the difficulty in predicting the behavior of the lamina propria at very high strain. Histological sections of the vocal fold and different staining techniques identified collagen, elastin, hyaluronan and, surprisingly, fat cells as components of the lamina propria. The distribution of all four components is not uniform, suggesting that different aspects of the lamina propria are drawn into oscillation depending on vocal fold tension. A differentiated recruitment of tissue into oscillation could extend the frequency range specifically at the upper end of the frequency scale."},{"title":"The last piece in the cellulase puzzle: the characterisation of β-glucosidase from the herbivorous gecarcinid land crab Gecarcoidea natalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/2950","abstract":"A 160 kDa enzyme with β-glucosidase activity was purified from the midgut gland of the land crab Gecarcoidea natalis. The enzyme was capable of releasing glucose progressively from cellobiose, cellotriose or cellotetraose. Although β-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) have some activity towards substrates longer than cellobiose, the enzyme was classified as a glucohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.74) as it had a preference for larger substrates (cellobiose<cellotriose=cellotetraose). It was able to synthesise some cellotetraose by the transglycosylation of smaller substrates – another common feature of glucohydrolases. The interaction between the glucohydrolase described here and the endo-β-1,4-glucanases described previously for G. natalis provides a complete model for cellulose hydrolysis in crustaceans and possibly in other invertebrates. After mechanical fragmentation by the gastric mill, multiple endo-β-1,4-glucanases would initially cleave β-1,4-glycosidic bonds within native cellulose, releasing small oligomers, including cellobiose, cellotriose and cellotetraose. The glucohydrolase would then attach to these oligomers, progressively releasing glucose. The glucohydrolase might also attach directly to crystalline cellulose to release glucose from free chain ends. This two-enzyme system differs from the traditional model, which suggests that total cellulose hydrolysis requires the presence an endo-β-1,4-glucanse, a cellobiohydrolase and a β-glucosidase."},{"title":"Phenotypic plasticity of gas exchange pattern and water loss in Scarabaeus spretus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae): deconstructing the basis for metabolic rate variation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/2940","abstract":"Investigation of gas exchange patterns and modulation of metabolism provide insight into metabolic control systems and evolution in diverse terrestrial environments. Variation in metabolic rate in response to environmental conditions has been explained largely in the context of two contrasting hypotheses, namely metabolic depression in response to stressful or resource-(e.g. water) limited conditions, or elevation of metabolism at low temperatures to sustain life in extreme conditions. To deconstruct the basis for metabolic rate changes in response to temperature variation, here we undertake a full factorial study investigating the longer- and short-term effects of temperature exposure on gas exchange patterns. We examined responses of traits of gas exchange [standard metabolic rate (SMR); discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) cycle frequency; cuticular, respiratory and total water loss rate (WLR)] to elucidate the magnitude and form of plastic responses in the dung beetle, Scarabaeus spretus. Results showed that short- and longer-term temperature variation generally have significant effects on SMR and WLR. Overall, acclimation to increased temperature led to a decline in SMR (from 0.071±0.004 ml CO2 h–1 in 15°C-acclimated beetles to 0.039±0.004 ml CO2 h–1 in 25°C-acclimated beetles measured at 20°C) modulated by reduced DGE frequency (15°C acclimation: 0.554±0.027 mHz, 20°C acclimation: 0.257±0.030 mHz, 25°C acclimation: 0.208±0.027 mHz recorded at 20°C), reduced cuticular WLRs (from 1.058±0.537 mg h–1 in 15°C-acclimated beetles to 0.900±0.400 mg h–1 in 25°C-acclimated beetles measured at 20°C) and reduced total WLR (from 4.2±0.5 mg h–1 in 15°C-acclimated beetles to 3.1±0.5 mg h–1 in 25°C-acclimated beetles measured at 25°C). Respiratory WLR was reduced from 2.25±0.40 mg h–1 in 15°C-acclimated beetles to 1.60±0.40 mg h–1 in 25°C-acclimated beetles measured at 25°C, suggesting conservation of water during DGE bursts. Overall, this suggests water conservation is a priority for S. spretus exposed to longer-term temperature variation, rather than elevation of SMR in response to low temperature acclimation, as might be expected from a beetle living in a relatively warm, low rainfall summer region. These results are significant for understanding the evolution of gas exchange patterns and trade-offs between metabolic rate and water balance in insects and other terrestrial arthropods."},{"title":"Application of the two-sample doubly labelled water method alters behaviour and affects estimates of energy expenditure in black-legged kittiwakes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/2958","abstract":"Despite the widespread use of the doubly labelled water (DLW) method in energetic studies of free-ranging animals, effects of the method on study animals are rarely assessed. We studied behavioural effects of two alternative DLW protocols. During two consecutive breeding seasons, 42 parent black-legged kittiwakes received either the commonly used two-sample (TS) or the less invasive single-sample (SS) DLW treatment. A third group served as a non-treated control. We evaluated the effect of treatment with respect to the time birds took to return to their nest after treatment and recaptures, and the nest attendance during DLW measurement periods. We found that TS kittiwakes took on average 20 times longer to return to their nest than SS kittiwakes after initial treatment, and nest attendance was reduced by about 40% relative to control birds. In contrast, nest attendance did not differ between control and SS kittiwakes. Estimates of energy expenditure of SS kittiwakes exceeded those of TS kittiwakes by 15%. This difference was probably caused by TS birds remaining inactive for extended time periods while at sea. Our results demonstrate that the common assumption that the TS DLW method has little impact on the behaviour of study subjects is in some circumstances fallacious. Estimates of energy expenditure derived by the SS approach may thus more accurately reflect unbiased rates of energy expenditure. However, the choice of protocol may be a trade-off between their impact on behaviour, and hence accuracy, and their differences in precision. Adopting procedures that minimize the impact of TS protocols may be useful."},{"title":"Comparative jet wake structure and swimming performance of salps","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/2967","abstract":"Salps are barrel-shaped marine invertebrates that swim by jet propulsion. Morphological variations among species and life-cycle stages are accompanied by differences in swimming mode. The goal of this investigation was to compare propulsive jet wakes and swimming performance variables among morphologically distinct salp species (Pegea confoederata, Weelia (Salpa) cylindrica, Cyclosalpa sp.) and relate swimming patterns to ecological function. Using a combination of in situ dye visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, we describe properties of the jet wake and swimming performance variables including thrust, drag and propulsive efficiency. Locomotion by all species investigated was achieved via vortex ring propulsion. The slow-swimming P. confoederata produced the highest weight-specific thrust (T=53 N kg–1) and swam with the highest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (ηwc=55%). The fast-swimming W. cylindrica had the most streamlined body shape but produced an intermediate weight-specific thrust (T=30 N kg–1) and swam with an intermediate whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (ηwc=52%). Weak swimming performance variables in the slow-swimming C. affinis, including the lowest weight-specific thrust (T=25 N kg–1) and lowest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (ηwc=47%), may be compensated by low energetic requirements. Swimming performance variables are considered in the context of ecological roles and evolutionary relationships."},{"title":"Entraining in trout: a behavioural and hydrodynamic analysis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/2976","abstract":"Rheophilic fish commonly experience unsteady flows and hydrodynamic perturbations. Instead of avoiding turbulent zones though, rheophilic fish often seek out these zones for station holding. A behaviour associated with station holding in running water is called entraining. We investigated the entraining behaviour of rainbow trout swimming in the wake of a D-shaped cylinder or sideways of a semi-infinite flat plate displaying a rounded leading edge. Entraining trout moved into specific positions close to and sideways of the submerged objects, where they often maintained their position without corrective body and/or fin motions. To identify the hydrodynamic mechanism of entraining, the flow characteristics around an artificial trout placed at the position preferred by entraining trout were analysed. Numerical simulations of the 3-D unsteady flow field were performed to obtain the unsteady pressure forces. Our results suggest that entraining trout minimise their energy expenditure during station holding by tilting their body into the mean flow direction at an angle, where the resulting lift force and wake suction force cancel out the drag. Small motions of the caudal and/or pectoral fins provide an efficient way to correct the angle, such that an equilibrium is even reached in case of unsteadiness imposed by the wake of an object."},{"title":"Lusitanian toadfish song reflects male quality","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/2997","abstract":"Lusitanian toadfish males that provide parental care rely on acoustic signals (the boatwhistle) to attract females to their nest. We test the hypothesis that male quality, namely male size and condition that are relevant for parental success, is reflected in vocal activity and boatwhistle characteristics and thus advertised to females. We recorded 22 males over a week during the peak of the breeding season. Calling rate and calling effort (percentage of time spent calling) strongly reflected male condition (lipid content of somatic muscles) and to a smaller extent sonic muscle hypertrophy and larger gonads. Males in better condition (increased body lipid and relative higher liver mass) also contracted the sonic muscles at faster rate as shown by the shorter boatwhistle pulse periods. Amplitude modulation reflected the degree of sonic muscle hypertrophy. None of the measured male quality parameters were good predictors of boatwhistle duration and dominant frequency. Altogether this study strongly suggests that Lusitanian toadfish males advertise their quality to females primarily with boatwhistle calling rate and calling effort, which mainly reflect male condition. Because pulse period had low variability, consistent with the existence of a vocal central pattern generator, we suggest that males that sustain sonic muscles contraction at a very fast rate close to their physiological limit may be honestly advertising their quality (condition). Similarly, males that produce boatwhistles with higher amplitude modulation, a feature that seems dependent on sonic muscle hypertrophy, could be more attractive to females."},{"title":"View-based strategy for reorientation by geometry","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/2987","abstract":"Human and non-human animals can use geometric information (metric information and left–right discrimination sense) to reorient themselves in an environment. The hypothesis that in so doing they rely on allocentric (map-like) representations has received wide consensus. However, theoretical models suggest that egocentric representations may represent efficient strategies for visuo-spatial navigation. Here, we provide, for the first time, evidence that a view-based strategy is effectively used by animals to reorient themselves in an array of landmarks. Domestic chicks were trained to locate a food-reward in a rectangular array of either four indistinguishable or distinctive pipes. In the key experimental series, the pipes had four openings, only one of which allowed the chicks to access the reward. The direction of the open access relative to the array was either maintained stable or it was changed throughout training. The relative position of the pipes in the array was maintained stable in both training conditions. Chicks reoriented according to configural geometry as long as the open access pointed in the same direction during training but failed when the positions of the openings was changed throughout training. When the correct pipe was characterized by a distinctive featural cue, chicks learnt to locate the reward irrespective of the stability of the direction to openings, indicating that place-navigation was dissociated from non-spatial learning.

In this study, different techniques were used to investigate a potential modulator of E. spinax luminescence – nitric oxide (NO). NO synthase (NOS)-like immunoreactivity (IR) was found in the photocytes (photogenic cells) of the photophores. In addition, acetylated tubulin IR also supported the presence of nerves running through the photogenic tissue and innervating different structural elements of the photophores: photocytes, pigmented cells from the iris-like structure and lens cells. Pharmacological experiments confirmed a modulatory action of NO on the hormonally induced luminescence: NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and hydroxylamine decreased the time to reach the maximum amplitude (TLmax) of MT-induced luminescence while these substances decreased the maximum amplitude of PRL-induced luminescence (and also the TLmax in the case of SNP). The small impact of the NOS inhibitor l-NAME on hormonally induced luminescence suggests that NO is only produced on demand. The cGMP analogue 8BrcGMP mimicked the effects of NO donors suggesting that the effects of NO are mediated by cGMP."},{"title":"Variation in innate immunity in relation to ectoparasite load, age and season: a field experiment in great tits (Parus major)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/3012","abstract":"It remains largely unknown which factors affect the innate immune responses of free-living birds. Nevertheless, the degree of innate immunity may play a crucial role in an individual's survival as it procures the first defence against pathogens. We manipulated the ectoparasite load of great tit (Parus major) nests by infesting them with hen fleas (Ceratophyllus gallinae) before egg laying. We subsequently quantified natural antibody (NAb) concentration and complement activation in nestlings and adult females during breeding and post-breeding periods. NAb concentrations increased in nestlings and adult females breeding in flea-infested nest boxes during the nestling provisioning period, but not in breeding females during incubation. In contrast, parasite abundance did not affect levels of complement activity in females. NAb levels of nestlings were already fully developed at the end of the nestling stage, but complement activation was only observed post-fledging. Concentrations of NAbs and complement activation of adult females were significantly lower during the breeding season compared with post-breeding levels, but did not differ between incubation and chick rearing. Further experimental studies in species that vary in life-history strategies will allow us to unravel the mechanisms underlying the observed variation in innate immune defences."},{"title":"Reliable detection of predator cues in afferent spike trains of a katydid under high background noise levels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/3036","abstract":"Katydid receivers face the problem of detecting behaviourally relevant predatory cues from echolocating bats in the same frequency domain as their own conspecific mating signals. We therefore tested the hypothesis that katydids are able to detect the presence of insectivorous bats in spike discharges at early stages of nervous processing in the auditory pathway by using the temporal details characteristic for responses to echolocation sequences. Spike activity was recorded from an identified nerve cell (omega neuron) under both laboratory and field conditions. In the laboratory, the preparation was stimulated with sequences of bat calls at different repetition rates typical for the guild of insectivorous bats, in the presence of background noise. The omega cell fired brief high-frequency bursts of action potentials in response to each bat sound pulse. Repetition rates of 18 and 24 Hz of these pulses resulted in a suppression of activity resulting from background noise, thus facilitating the detection of bat calls. The spike activity typical for responses to bat echolocation contrasts to responses to background noise, producing different distributions of inter-spike intervals. This allowed development of a ‘neuronal bat detector’ algorithm, optimized to detect responses to bats in afferent spike trains. The algorithm was applied to more than 24 hours of outdoor omega-recordings performed either at a rainforest clearing with high bat activity or in rainforest understory, where bat activity was low. In 95% of cases, the algorithm detected a bat reliably, even under high background noise, and correctly rejected responses when an electronic bat detector showed no response."},{"title":"On the role of copepod antennae in the production of hydrodynamic force during hopping","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/3019","abstract":"We integrate high-resolution experimental observations of a freely hopping copepod with three-dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the role of the copepod antennae in production of hydrodynamic force during hopping. The experimental observations revealed a distinctive asymmetrical deformation of the antennae during the power and return strokes, which lead us to the hypothesis that the antennae are active contributors to the production of propulsive force with kinematics selected in nature in order to maximize net thrust. To examine the validity of this hypothesis we carried out numerical experiments using an anatomically realistic, tethered, virtual copepod, by prescribing two sets of antenna kinematics. In the first set, each antenna moves as a rigid, oar-like structure in a reversible manner, whereas in the second set, the antenna is made to move asymmetrically as a deformable structure as revealed by the experiments. The computed results show that for both cases the antennae are major contributors to the net thrust force during hopping, and the results also clearly demonstrate the significant hydrodynamic benefit in terms of thrust enhancement and drag reduction derived from the biologically realistic, asymmetric antenna motion. This finding is not surprising given the low local Reynolds number environment within which the antenna operates, and points to striking similarities between the copepod antenna motion and ciliary propulsion. Finally, the simulations provide the first glimpse into the complex, highly 3-D structure of copepod wakes."},{"title":"A linear systems analysis of the yaw dynamics of a dynamically scaled insect model","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/3047","abstract":"Recent studies suggest that fruit flies use subtle changes to their wing motion to actively generate forces during aerial maneuvers. In addition, it has been estimated that the passive rotational damping caused by the flapping wings of an insect is around two orders of magnitude greater than that for the body alone. At present, however, the relationships between the active regulation of wing kinematics, passive damping produced by the flapping wings and the overall trajectory of the animal are still poorly understood. In this study, we use a dynamically scaled robotic model equipped with a torque feedback mechanism to study the dynamics of yaw turns in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Four plausible mechanisms for the active generation of yaw torque are examined. The mechanisms deform the wing kinematics of hovering in order to introduce asymmetry that results in the active production of yaw torque by the flapping wings. The results demonstrate that the stroke-averaged yaw torque is well approximated by a model that is linear with respect to both the yaw velocity and the magnitude of the kinematic deformations. Dynamic measurements, in which the yaw torque produced by the flapping wings was used in real-time to determine the rotation of the robot, suggest that a first-order linear model with stroke-average coefficients accurately captures the yaw dynamics of the system. Finally, an analysis of the stroke-average dynamics suggests that both damping and inertia will be important factors during rapid body saccades of a fruit fly."},{"title":"The adaptive significance of crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH) in daily and seasonal migratory activities of the Christmas Island red crab Gecarcoidea natalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/17/3062","abstract":"The Christmas Island red crab Gecarcoidea natalis undergoes extreme changes in metabolic status, ranging from inactivity during the dry season, to a spectacular annual breeding migration at the start of the wet season. The dramatic change in metabolic physiology that this polarisation entails should be reflected in changes in endocrine physiology, particularly that of the crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH), of which we know relatively little. CHH levels were measured using a novel ultrasensitive time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA), together with metabolites (glucose, lactate), in the field at several scales of temporal resolution, during migratory activities (wet season) and during the inactive fossorial phase (dry season). Release patterns of CHH were measured during extreme (forced) exercise, showing for the first time an unexpectedly rapid pulsatile release of this hormone. A seasonally dependent glucose-sensitive negative-feedback loop was identified that might be important in energy mobilisation during migration. Haemolymph lactate levels were strongly correlated with CHH levels in both field and experimental animals. During migration, CHH levels were lower than during the dry season and, during migration, daytime CHH levels (when most locomotor activity occurred) increased. However, the intense dawn activity in both dry and wet seasons was not always associated with repeatable hyperglycaemia or CHH release. The results obtained are discussed in relation to the life history and behaviour of G. natalis."},{"title":"An entomopathogenic Caenorhabditis briggsae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/18/3223","abstract":"Caenorhabditis elegans is a premier model organism upon which considerable knowledge of basic cell and developmental biology has been built. Yet, as is true for many traditional model systems, we have limited knowledge of the ecological context in which these systems evolved, severely limiting our understanding of gene function. A better grasp of the ecology of model systems would help us immensely in understanding the functionality of genes and evolution of genomes in an environmental context. Consequently, there are ongoing efforts to uncover natural populations of this model system globally. Here, we describe the discovery of a Caenorhabditis briggsae strain and its bacterial associate (Serratia sp.) that form an entomopathogenic complex in the wild. Laboratory experiments confirm that this nematode and its natural bacterial associate can penetrate, kill and reproduce in an insect host and that the bacterial associate can induce this insect pathogenic life cycle in other Caenorhabditis species, including C. elegans. Our findings suggest that this life history may be widespread in nature and critical to the understanding of the biology of this important model organism. Caenorhabditis–insect interaction could be a key factor in our quest for a better grasp of gene functionality in this important model species.

Mosquitoes provided with access to sugar during rehydration survived longer than those allowed to rehydrate without sugar, and their survival was similar to that of mosquitoes of the same age that were not dehydrated. Among mosquitoes not provided with sugar, each dehydration bout reduced the mosquito's dry mass – an effect likely to be due to the utilization of carbohydrates and lipid reserves. The toll on glycogen and lipid reserves is likely to be especially costly for diapausing mosquitoes that are dependent on these stored reserves for winter survival. Egg production in both non-diapausing and post-diapausing C. pipiens was also reduced in response to multiple bouts of dehydration. Although egg quality was not compromised, the number of eggs produced was reduced. Both non-diapausing and diapausing females can compensate for the nutrient loss due to dehydration by sugar feeding but the opportunity to feed on sugar is likely to be rarely available in the overwintering habitat of diapausing females, thus the impact of dehydration may be especially pronounced in overwintering populations of C. pipiens."},{"title":"The mechanical power output of the pectoralis muscle of cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus): the in vivo muscle length trajectory and activity patterns and their implications for power modulation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/16/2770","abstract":"In order to meet the varying demands of flight, pectoralis muscle power output must be modulated. In birds with pectoralis muscles with a homogeneous fibre type composition, power output can be modulated at the level of the motor unit (via changes in muscle length trajectory and the pattern of activation), at the level of the muscle (via changes in the number of motor units recruited), and at the level of the whole animal (through the use of intermittent flight). Pectoralis muscle length trajectory and activity patterns were measured in vivo in the cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus) at a range of flight speeds (0–16 m s−1) using sonomicrometry and electromyography. The work loop technique was used to measure the mechanical power output of a bundle of fascicles isolated from the pectoralis muscle during simulated in vivo length change and activity patterns. The mechanical power–speed relationship was U-shaped, with a 2.97-fold variation in power output (40–120 W kg−1). In this species, modulation of neuromuscular activation is the primary strategy utilised to modulate pectoralis muscle power output. Maximum in vivo power output was 22% of the maximum isotonic power output (533 W kg−1) and was generated at a lower relative shortening velocity (0.28Vmax) than the maximum power output during isotonic contractions (0.34Vmax). It seems probable that the large pectoralis muscle strains result in a shift in the optimal relative shortening velocity in comparison with the optimum during isotonic contractions as a result of length–force effects."},{"title":"The metabolic power requirements of flight and estimations of flight muscle efficiency in the cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/16/2788","abstract":"Little is known about how in vivo muscle efficiency, that is the ratio of mechanical and metabolic power, is affected by changes in locomotory tasks. One of the main problems with determining in vivo muscle efficiency is the large number of muscles generally used to produce mechanical power. Animal flight provides a unique model for determining muscle efficiency because only one muscle, the pectoralis muscle, produces nearly all of the mechanical power required for flight. In order to estimate in vivo flight muscle efficiency, we measured the metabolic cost of flight across a range of flight speeds (6–13 m s−1) using masked respirometry in the cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus) and compared it with measurements of mechanical power determined in the same wind tunnel. Similar to measurements of the mechanical power–speed relationship, the metabolic power–speed relationship had a U-shape, with a minimum at 10 m s−1. Although the mechanical and metabolic power–speed relationships had similar minimum power speeds, the metabolic power requirements are not a simple multiple of the mechanical power requirements across a range of flight speeds. The pectoralis muscle efficiency (estimated from mechanical and metabolic power, basal metabolism and an assumed value for the ‘postural costs’ of flight) increased with flight speed and ranged from 6.9% to 11.2%. However, it is probable that previous estimates of the postural costs of flight have been too low and that the pectoralis muscle efficiency is higher."},{"title":"Comparison between mechanical power requirements of flight estimated using an aerodynamic model and in vitro muscle performance in the cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/16/2781","abstract":"There have been few comparisons between the relationship between the mechanical power requirements of flight and flight speed obtained using different approaches.

Aerodynamic power was calculated using different ranges of values for the coefficients in the equations: induced power factor (k 1.0–1.4), the profile (CD,pro 0.01–0.03) and parasite drag (CD,par 0.05–0.195) coefficients.

Fish were exposed to graded hypercarbia (1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20% CO2) and also to graded levels of environmental acidosis (pH ~7.0, 6.0, 5.8, 5.6, 5.3 and 4.7) equal to the pH levels of the hypercarbic water to distinguish the relative roles of CO2 versus H+. We also injected boluses of CO2-equilibrated solutions (5, 10 and 20% CO2) and acid solutions equilibrated to the same pH as the CO2 boluses into the caudal vein (internal) and buccal cavity (external) to distinguish between internal and external stimuli. The putative location of the chemoreceptors was determined by bilateral denervation of branches of cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal) and X (vagus) to the gills. The data indicate that the chemoreceptors eliciting bradycardia, hypertension and gill ventilatory responses (increased frequency and amplitude) to hypercarbia are exclusively branchial, externally oriented and respond specifically to changes in CO2 and not H+. Those involved in producing the cardiovascular responses appeared to be distributed across all gill arches while those involved in the gill ventilatory responses were located primarily on the first gill arch. Higher levels of aquatic CO2 depressed gill ventilation and stimulated air breathing. The chemoreceptors involved in producing air breathing in response to hypercarbia also appeared to be branchial, distributed across all gill arches and responded specifically to changes in aquatic CO2. This would suggest that chemoreceptor groups with different orientations (blood versus water) are involved in eliciting air-breathing responses to hypercarbia in jeju."},{"title":"Development of a dopaminergic system in sea urchin embryos and larvae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/16/2808","abstract":"The mechanisms that regulate the organized swimming movements of sea urchin blastulae are largely unknown. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that dopamine (DA) and the Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus homolog of the dopamine receptor D1 (Hp-DRD1) were strongly co-localized in 1–2 μm diameter granules (DA/DRD1 granules). Furthermore, these granules were arranged across the entire surface of blastulae as they developed locomotory cilia before hatching, and remained evident until metamorphosis. DA/DRD1 granules were associated with the basal bodies of cilia, and were densely packed in the ciliary band by the eight-arm pluteus stage. The transcription of Hp-DRD1 was detected from the unfertilized egg stage throughout the period of larval development. Treatment with S-(–)-carbidopa, an inhibitor of aromatic-l-amino acid decarboxylase, for 20–24 h (i) from soon after insemination until the 20 h post-fertilization (20 hpf) early gastrula stage and (ii) from the 24 hpf prism larva stage until the 48 hpf pluteus stage, inhibited the formation of DA granules and decreased the swimming activity of blastulae and larvae in a dose-dependent manner. Exogenous DA rescued these deprivations. The formation of DRD1 granules was not affected. However, in 48 hpf plutei, the serotonergic nervous system (5HT-NS) developed normally. Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides directed against Hp-DRD1 inhibited the formation of DRD1 granules and the swimming of larvae, but did not disturb the formation of DA granules. Thus, the formation of DRD1 granules and DA granules occurs chronologically closely but mechanically independently and the swimming of blastulae is regulated by the dopaminergic system. In plutei, the 5HT-NS closely surrounded the ciliary bands, suggesting the functional collaboration with the dopaminergic system in larvae."},{"title":"Peak energy turnover in lactating European hares: a test of the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/16/2832","abstract":"It has been suggested that maximum sustained metabolic rate (SusMR) in mammals as reached, for instance, during lactation, is due to a limited capacity for heat dissipation. Here, we experimentally tested whether heat dissipation limitation (HDL) also constrains energy turnover in lactating European hares. Experimentally, we made use of the fact that hares nurse their young only once per day, which allowed us to keep females and young either at the same or at different ambient temperatures. During the last lactation week (week 4) females kept at thermoneutrality (22°C), irrespective of the cold load of their young, had significantly lower rates of metabolisable energy intake (MEI) than cold-exposed mothers (5°C), as predicted by the HDL hypothesis. However, in week 2 of lactation females at thermoneutrality rearing cold-exposed young were able to increase MEI to levels indistinguishable from those of cold-exposed females. Thus, even at thermoneutral temperature females reached maximum rates of energy turnover, which was inconsistent with the HDL hypothesis. We conclude that SusMR in lactating European hares typically results not from physiological constraints but from an active restriction of their energy turnover in order to maximise lifetime reproductive success."},{"title":"Cuticular plasticization in the tick, Amblyomma hebraeum (Acari: Ixodidae): possible roles of monoamines and cuticular pH","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/16/2820","abstract":"The degree of plasticization of the alloscutal cuticle of a ‘hard’ (ixodid) tick, Amblyomma hebraeum, and a ‘soft’ (argasid) tick, Ornithodoros moubata, was assessed throughout the blood-feeding period. Cuticle viscosity was calculated from rate of creep of cuticle under constant load using a Maxwell model. Feeding-related plasticization (i.e. increased rate of extension under a constant load) occurred in A. hebraeum but not in O. moubata. Maxwell viscosity of unfed A. hebraeum cuticle was relatively high (~720 GPa s) but was significantly lower in feeding ticks. Small partially fed ticks displayed a viscosity of ~108 GPa s. Still lower values (42 GPa s) were observed in the largest of the engorged ticks. Following cessation of feeding, there was a significant but limited reversal in viscosity back to ~100 GPa s. The water content of cuticle of unfed A. hebraeum (23.4% of wet mass) rose sharply after the onset of feeding and reached a plateau value of 34.0% at a fed/unfed weight ratio of 3 and beyond. Ixodid ticks lay down new endocuticle during the feeding period. The observed increase in cuticle hydration suggests that both old and new cuticles are hydrated during feeding. Monoamines may play an important role in controlling cuticle viscosity. Dopamine (DA) injected into partially fed A. hebraeum caused plasticization. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT), which induces plasticization in the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus, had no statistically significant effect on tick cuticle. Octopamine (OA) and tyramine both caused cuticle stiffening (i.e. opposed plasticization). This suggests a possible inhibitory effect but co-injection of OA with DA did not reduce DA-induced plasticization. The mechanism leading to plasticization of tick cuticle may involve a change in cuticular pH. The viscosity of tick cuticle loops was highest at pH 8.0 (389 GPa s) and fell precipitously in the acidic range to a low value of 2.2 GPa s at pH 5.5–5.7. A cuticular pH of ~6.5 would account for the lowest viscosity observed under physiological conditions (42.4 GPa s for large, day 0, engorged ticks). The V-ATPase inhibitor, concanamycin A, was a potent inhibitor of DA-induced plasticization. These results are consistent with a model in which DA acts to cause plasticization through transport of H+ ions into the cuticle. Measurement of cuticular ion (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) content did not suggest that plasticization is caused by any of these ions. Taken together, our results suggest that the mechanism of cuticular plasticization in feeding A. hebraeum is related to hydration, and involves the transport of H+ ions into the sub-cuticular space by cells in the hypodermis. Feeding-induced plasticization was not observed in the rapid feeding tick, O. moubata."},{"title":"Sound transmission and the recognition of temporally degraded sexual advertisement signals in Cope's gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/16/2840","abstract":"Acoustic communication signals degrade as they propagate between signalers and receivers. While we generally understand the degrading effects of sound propagation on the structure of acoustic signals, we know considerably less about how receivers make behavioral decisions based on the perception of degraded signals in sonically and structurally complex habitats where communication occurs. In this study of acoustic mate recognition in Cope's gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis (Cope 1880), we investigated how the temporal structure of male advertisement calls was compromised by propagation in a natural habitat and how females responded to stimuli mimicking various levels of temporal degradation. In a sound transmission experiment, we quantified changes in the pulsed structure of signals by broadcasting synthetic calls during active choruses from positions where we typically encountered signalers, and re-recording the signals from positions where we typically encountered potential receivers. Our main finding was that the silent gaps between pulses become increasingly ‘filled in’ by background noise and reverberations as a function of increasing propagation distance. We also conducted female phonotaxis experiments to determine the threshold modulation depth required to elicit recognition of the pulsatile structure of the call. Females were surprisingly tolerant of degraded temporal structure, and there was a tendency for greater permissiveness at lower playback levels. We discuss these results in terms of presumed mechanisms of call recognition in complex environments and the acoustic adaptation hypothesis."},{"title":"Electrolytic lesions within central complex neuropils of the cockroach brain affect negotiation of barriers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/16/2851","abstract":"Animals must negotiate obstacles in their path in order to successfully function within natural environments. These actions require transitions from walking to other behaviors, many of which are more involved than simple reflexes. For these behaviors to be successful, insects must evaluate objects in their path and then use that information to change posture or re-direct leg movements. Some of this control may occur within a region of the brain known as the central complex (CC). We used discrete electrolytic lesions to examine the role of certain sub-regions of the CC in various obstacle negotiation behaviors. We found that cockroaches with lesions to the protocerebral bridge (PB) and ellipsoid body (EB) exhibit abnormalities in turning and dealing with shelf-like objects; whereas, individuals with lesions to the fan-shaped body (FB) and lateral accessory lobe (LAL), exhibit abnormalities of those behaviors as well as climbing over blocks and up walls to a horizontal plane. Abnormalities in block climbing include decreased success rate, changes in climbing strategy, and delayed response to the block. Increases in these abnormal behaviors were significant in individuals with lesions to the FB and LAL. Although turning abnormalities are present in individuals with lesions to the LAL, EB and the lateral region of the FB, there are some differences in how these deficits present. For instance, the turning deficits seen in individuals with lateral FB lesions only occurred when turning in the direction opposite to the side of the brain on which the lesion occurred. By contrast, individuals with lesions to the EB and LAL exhibited turning abnormalities in both directions. Lesions in the medial region of the FB did not result in directional turning deficits, but in abnormalities in block climbing."},{"title":"Tarsal taste neuron activity and proboscis extension reflex in response to sugars and amino acids in Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/16/2889","abstract":"In adult female Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), the fifth tarsomere of the prothoracic legs bears 14 gustatory trichoid chemosensilla. These chemosensilla were characterized through electrophysiological experiments by stimulating with sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose, myo-inositol and 20 common amino acids. In electrophysiological recordings from nine sensilla, responses were obtained to certain compounds tested at 100 mmol l−1, and the response spectra differed from broad to narrow. The four sugars excited the same receptor neuron in sensillum a and sensillum b; sucrose and myo-inositol, sucrose and lysine, myo-inositol and lysine excited two different receptor neurons respectively in sensillum a; fructose and lysine excited two different receptor neurons in sensillum n. Furthermore, the four sugars, myo-inositol and lysine all elicited concentration-dependent electrophysiological responses. These six compounds also induced the proboscis extension reflex (PER) followed by ingestion of the solution when they were applied on the tarsi. Lysine and sucrose caused the strongest electrophysiological responses. However, sucrose had the strongest stimulatory effect on the PER whereas lysine had the weakest. Mixtures of sucrose with the other sugars or with lysine had a similar stimulatory effect on the PER as sucrose alone. The electrophysiological and behavioural responses caused by a range of sucrose concentrations were positively correlated. We conclude that the tarsal gustatory sensilla play an essential role in perceiving sugars available in floral nectar and provide chemosensory information determining feeding behaviour. Tarsal taste-receptor-neuron responses to lysine are implicated in oviposition behaviour."},{"title":"Phenylhydrazine-induced anemia causes nitric-oxide-mediated upregulation of the angiogenic pathway in Notothenia coriiceps","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/16/2865","abstract":"Antarctic icefishes possess several cardiovascular characteristics that enable them to deliver oxygen adequately in the absence of hemoglobin (Hb). To gain insight into mechanisms driving development of these cardiovascular characteristics of icefish, we chemically induced severe anemia in a red-blooded notothenioid, Notothenia coriiceps. After 10 days of treatment with phenylhydrazine HCl, the hematocrit and Hb concentration of N. coriiceps decreased by >90% and >70%, respectively. Anemic fish exhibited a significantly higher concentration of nitric oxide (NO) metabolites in their plasma compared with that of control animals, indicating that corporeal levels of NO are higher in anemic animals than in control fish. The activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was measured in brain, retina, pectoral muscle and ventricle of control and anemic animals. With the exception of retina, no significant differences in NOS activities were observed, indicating that the increase in plasma NO metabolites is due to loss of Hb, which normally plays a major role in the degradation of NO, and not due to an overall increase in the capacity for NO production. To determine whether loss of Hb can stimulate remodeling of the cardiovascular system, we measured expression of HIF-1α, PHD2 and VEGF mRNA in retinae of control and anemic fish. Expression of all three genes was higher in anemic animals compared with control N. coriiceps, suggesting a causative relationship between loss of Hb and induction of angiogenesis that probably is mediated through nitric oxide signaling."},{"title":"Predation or scavenging? Thoracic muscle pH and rates of water loss reveal cause of death in arthropods","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2640","abstract":"The difficulty of directly observing predatory events hinders a complete understanding of how predation structures food webs. Indirect approaches such as PCR-based and isotopic analyses clarify patterns of resource consumption but fail to distinguish predation from scavenging. Given that facultative scavenging is a ubiquitous and phylogenetically widespread foraging strategy, an improved ability to discriminate prey from carrion is needed to enhance an understanding of the demographic effects of consumption and the true nature of trophic interactions. Using physiological properties of muscle tissue – specifically pH and rate of water loss – we develop a novel method to discriminate prey from carrion collected by scavenging hymenopteran predators. Our focal system is the western yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica), a common scavenging predator in Hawaii and western North America. Prior to consumption, the physical properties of hymenopteran muscle tissue change in a quantifiable and deterministic manner post mortem and can be used to estimate the time and putative cause of death of diet items. Applying this method in laboratory and field situations resulted in the correct identification of prey and carrion in 49 out of 56 cases (88%). Although further investigation is needed to determine how post-mortem physiology of diet items changes in the guts of consumers, the approaches developed in this study can be used to distinguish predation from scavenging by central-place foragers (particularly arthropods). Such information will provide a more definitive characterization of species interactions and food webs."},{"title":"Scaling for stress similarity and distorted-shape similarity in bending and torsion under maximal muscle forces concurs with geometric similarity among different-sized animals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/16/2873","abstract":"When geometric similarity, or isometry, prevails among animals of different sizes their form and proportions are similar. Weight increases as the cube of the length dimension, while cross-sectional areas increase as its square, so in load-bearing structural elements the stress, caused by the body weight, increases in direct proportion to the length dimension, both for pure axial loads and for transverse bending and torsional loads. On this account, large body sizes would be expected to set up compensatory selection on the proportions of supporting structures, making them disproportionately thicker as required to maintain similar, size-independent safety factors against breakage. Most previous scaling theories have assumed that the strength of support elements has evolved with respect to loads due to the body weight. But then, from the arguments above, a scaling principle different from the geometric similarity rule would be required in order for safety factors to remain similar among different-sized animals. Still, most comparable animals of ‘similar kind’ scale in accordance with the geometric similarity rule. Here, we instead argue that muscle forces cause much larger loads on structural support elements during maximum performance events (such as during prey capture or escape from predators) than do loads dictated by the body weight (such as during cruising locomotion), and that structural strength therefore might evolve with respect to maximal muscle forces rather than to the body weight. We explore how the transverse and longitudinal lengths of structural support elements must scale to one another, and to muscle transverse length, in order to satisfy each of the following, functionally based, similarity principles for support elements placed in bending, or in torsion, by maximal muscle forces during locomotion: (1) similarity in axial stress, or (2) in torsional shear stress, and (3) similarity in bent shape, or (4) in twisted shape. A dimensional relationship that satisfies all four conditions actually turns out to be the geometric similarity rule. These functional attributes may therefore help to explain the prevalence of geometric similarity among animals. Conformance of different-sized species with the geometric similarity principle has not been directly selected for as such, of course, but may have arisen as a by-product of adaptation in morphological proportions, following upon selection, in each separate species-lineage, for adequate and similar safety factors against breakage, and similar optimal distorted shapes, of structural support elements placed in bending, or in torsion, by maximal muscle forces."},{"title":"Sparse but specific temporal coding by spikes in an insect sensory-motor ocellar pathway","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2629","abstract":"We investigate coding in a locust brain neuron, DNI, which transforms graded synaptic input from ocellar L-neurons into axonal spikes that travel to excite particular thoracic flight neurons. Ocellar neurons are naturally stimulated by fluctuations in light collected from a wide field of view, for example when the visual horizon moves up and down. We used two types of stimuli: fluctuating light from a light-emitting diode (LED), and a visual horizon displayed on an electrostatic monitor. In response to randomly fluctuating light stimuli delivered from the LED, individual spikes in DNI occur sparsely but are timed to sub-millisecond precision, carrying substantial information: 4.5–7 bits per spike in our experiments. In response to these light stimuli, the graded potential signal in DNI carries considerably less information than in presynaptic L-neurons. DNI is excited in phase with either sinusoidal light from an LED or a visual horizon oscillating up and down at 20 Hz, and changes in mean light level or mean horizon level alter the timing of excitation for each cycle. DNI is a multimodal interneuron, but its ability to time spikes precisely in response to ocellar stimulation is not degraded by additional excitation. We suggest that DNI is part of an optical proprioceptor system, responding to the optical signal induced in the ocelli by nodding movements of the locust head during each wing-beat."},{"title":"Serotonin and its metabolism in basal deuterostomes: insights from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Xenoturbella bocki","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2647","abstract":"Serotonin (5-HT), an important molecule in metazoans, is involved in a range of biological processes including neurotransmission and neuromodulation. Both its creation and release are tightly regulated, as is its removal. Multiple neurochemical pathways are responsible for the catabolism of 5-HT and are phyla specific; therefore, by elucidating these catabolic pathways we glean greater understanding of the relationships and origins of various transmitter systems. Here, 5-HT catabolic pathways were studied in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Xenoturbella bocki, two organisms occupying distinct positions in deuterostomes. The 5-HT-related compounds detected in these organisms were compared with those reported in other phyla. In S. purpuratus, 5-HT-related metabolites include N-acetyl serotonin, γ-glutamyl-serotonin and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid; the quantity and type were found to vary based on the specific tissues analyzed. In addition to these compounds, varying levels of tryptamine were also seen. Upon addition of a 5-HT precursor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, 5-HT itself was detected. In similar experiments using X. bocki tissues, the 5-HT-related compounds found included 5-HT sulfate, γ-glutamyl-serotonin and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, as well as 5-HT and tryptamine. The sea urchin metabolizes 5-HT in a manner similar to both gastropod mollusks, as evidenced by the detection of γ-glutamyl-serotonin, and vertebrates, as indicated by the presence of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid and N-acetyl serotonin. In contrast, 5-HT metabolism in X. bocki appears more similar to common protostome 5-HT catabolic pathways."},{"title":"Harbor seal vibrissa morphology suppresses vortex-induced vibrations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2665","abstract":"Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) often live in dark and turbid waters, where their mystacial vibrissae, or whiskers, play an important role in orientation. Besides detecting and discriminating objects by direct touch, harbor seals use their whiskers to analyze water movements, for example those generated by prey fish or by conspecifics. Even the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately (hydrodynamic trail following). While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular to the swimming direction. Remarkably, the whiskers of harbor seals possess a specialized undulated surface structure, the function of which was, up to now, unknown. Here, we show that this structure effectively changes the vortex street behind the whiskers and reduces the vibrations that would otherwise be induced by the shedding of vortices from the whiskers (vortex-induced vibrations). Using force measurements, flow measurements and numerical simulations, we find that the dynamic forces on harbor seal whiskers are, by at least an order of magnitude, lower than those on sea lion (Zalophus californianus) whiskers, which do not share the undulated structure. The results are discussed in the light of pinniped sensory biology and potential biomimetic applications."},{"title":"Balance responses to lateral perturbations in human treadmill walking","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2655","abstract":"During walking on a treadmill 10 human subjects (mean age 20 years) were perturbed by 100 ms pushes or pulls to the left or the right, of various magnitudes and in various phases of the gait cycle. Balance was maintained by (1) a stepping strategy (synergy), in which the foot at the next step is positioned a fixed distance outward of the ‘extrapolated centre of mass’, and (2) a lateral ankle strategy, which comprises a medial or lateral movement of the centre of pressure under the foot sole. The extrapolated centre of mass is defined as the centre of mass position plus the centre of mass velocity multiplied by a parameter related to the subject's leg length. The ankle strategy is the fastest, with a mechanical delay of about 200 ms (20% of a stride), but it can displace the centre of pressure no more than 2 cm. The stepping strategy needs at least 300 ms (30% of a stride) before foot placement, but has a range of 20 cm. When reaction time is sufficient, the magnitude of the total response is in good agreement with our hypothesis: mean centre of pressure (foot) position is a constant distance outward of the extrapolated centre of mass. If the reaction time falls short, a further correction is applied in the next step. In the healthy subjects studied here, no further corrections were necessary, so balance was recovered within two steps (one stride)."},{"title":"Turning crocodilian hearts into bird hearts: growth rates are similar for alligators with and without right-to-left cardiac shunt","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2673","abstract":"The functional and possible adaptive significance of non-avian reptiles' dual aortic arch system and the ability of all non-avian reptiles to perform central vascular cardiac shunts have been of great interest to comparative physiologists. The unique cardiac anatomy of crocodilians – a four-chambered heart with the dual aortic arch system – allows for only right-to-left (R–L; pulmonary bypass) cardiac shunt and for surgical elimination of this shunt. Surgical removal of the R–L shunt, by occluding the left aorta (LAo) upstream and downstream of the foramen of Panizza, results in a crocodilian with an obligatory, avian/mammalian central circulation. In this study, R–L cardiac shunt was eliminated in age-matched, female American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis; 5–7 months of age). We tested the hypothesis that surgical elimination of R–L cardiac shunt would impair growth (a readily measured proxy for fitness) compared with sham-operated, age-matched controls, especially in animals subjected to exhaustive exercise. While regular exercise caused a decrease in size (snout-to-vent length, head length and body mass), elimination of the capacity for R–L cardiac shunt did not greatly reduce animal growth, despite a chronic ventricular enlargement in surgically altered juvenile alligators. We speculate that, despite being slightly smaller, alligators with an occluded LAo would have reached sexual maturity in the same breeding season as control alligators. This study suggests that crocodilian R–L cardiac shunt does not provide an adaptive advantage for juvenile alligator growth and supports the logic that cardiac shunts persist in crocodilians because they have not been selected against."},{"title":"Acid–base responses to feeding and intestinal Cl– uptake in freshwater- and seawater-acclimated killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, an agastric euryhaline teleost","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2681","abstract":"Marine teleosts generally secrete basic equivalents (HCO3–) and take up Na+ and Cl– in the intestine so as to promote absorption of H2O. However, neither the integration of these functions with feeding nor the potential role of the gut in ionoregulation and acid–base balance in freshwater have been well studied. The euryhaline killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) is unusual in lacking both an acid-secreting stomach and a mechanism for Cl– uptake at the gills in freshwater. Responses to a satiation meal were evaluated in both freshwater- and seawater-acclimated killifish. In intact animals, there was no change in acid or base flux to the external water after the meal, in accord with the absence of any post-prandial alkaline tide in the blood. Indeed, freshwater animals exhibited a post-prandial metabolic acidosis (‘acidic tide’), whereas seawater animals showed no change in blood acid–base status. In vitro gut sac experiments revealed a substantially higher rate of Cl– absorption by the intestine in freshwater killifish, which was greatest at 1–3 h after feeding. The Cl– concentration of the absorbate was higher in preparations from freshwater animals than from seawater killifish and increased with fasting. Surprisingly, net basic equivalent secretion rates were also much higher in preparations from freshwater animals, in accord with the ‘acidic tide’; in seawater preparations, they were lowest after feeding and increased with fasting. Bafilomycin (1 μmol l–1) promoted an 80% increase in net base secretion rates, as well as in Cl– and fluid absorption, at 1–3 h post-feeding in seawater preparations only, explaining the difference between freshwater and seawater fish. Preparations from seawater animals at 1–3 h post-feeding also acidified the mucosal saline, and this effect was associated with a marked rise in PCO2, which was attenuated by bafilomycin. Measurements of chyme pH from intact animals confirmed that intestinal fluid (chyme) pH and basic equivalent concentration were lowest after feeding in seawater killifish, whereas PCO2 was greatly elevated (80–95 Torr) in chyme from both seawater and freshwater animals but declined to lower levels (13 Torr) after 1–2 weeks fasting. There were no differences in pH, PCO2 or the concentrations of basic equivalents in intestinal fluid from seawater versus freshwater animals at 12–24 h or 1–2 weeks post-feeding. The results are interpreted in terms of the absence of gastric HCl secretion, the limitations of the gills for acid–base balance and Cl– transport, and therefore the need for intestinal Cl– uptake in freshwater killifish, and the potential for O2 release from the mucosal blood flow by the high PCO2 in the intestinal fluids. At least in seawater killifish, H+-ATPase running in parallel to HCO3–:Cl– exchange in the apical membranes of teleost enterocytes might reduce net base secretion and explain the high PCO2 in the chyme after feeding."},{"title":"Fruit bats (Pteropodidae) fuel their metabolism rapidly and directly with exogenous sugars","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2693","abstract":"Previous studies reported that fed bats and birds mostly use recently acquired exogenous nutrients as fuel for flight, rather than endogenous fuels, such as lipids or glycogen. However, this pattern of fuel use may be a simple size-related phenomenon because, to date, only small birds and bats have been studied with respect to the origin of metabolized fuel, and because small animals carry relatively small energy reserves, considering their high mass-specific metabolic rate. We hypothesized that ∼150 g Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus Pteropodidae), which are more than an order of magnitude heavier than previously studied bats, also catabolize dietary sugars directly and exclusively to fuel both rest and flight metabolism. We based our expectation on the observation that these animals rapidly transport ingested dietary sugars, which are absorbed via passive paracellular pathways in the intestine, to organs of high energy demand. We used the stable carbon isotope ratio in exhaled CO2 (δ13Cbreath) to assess the origin of metabolized substrates in 16 Egyptian fruit bats that were maintained on a diet of C3 plants before experiments. First, we predicted that in resting bats δ13Cbreath remains constant when bats ingest C3 sucrose, but increases and converges on the dietary isotopic signature when C4 sucrose and C4 glucose are ingested. Second, if flying fruit bats use exogenous nutrients exclusively to fuel flight, we predicted that δ13Cbreath of flying bats would converge on the isotopic signature of the C4 sucrose they were fed. Both resting and flying Egyptian fruit bats, indeed, directly fuelled their metabolism with freshly ingested exogenous substrates. The rate at which the fruit bats oxidized dietary sugars was as fast as in 10 g nectar-feeding bats and 5 g hummingbirds. Our results support the notion that flying bats, irrespective of their size, catabolize dietary sugars directly, and possibly exclusively, to fuel flight."},{"title":"The importance of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in subtraction of electrosensory reafference in the dorsal nucleus of skates","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2700","abstract":"The dorsal nucleus of the little skate is a cerebellum-like sensory structure that adaptively filters out predictable electrosensory inputs. The filter's plasticity is mediated by anti-Hebbian associative depression at the synapses between parallel fibers and ascending efferent neurons (AENs). Changes in synaptic strength are indicated by the formation of a cancellation signal which is initiated by co-activation of parallel fibers and AENs, and can be reversed by parallel fiber activity in the absence of AEN activation. In other cerebellum-like sensory structures, the formation of the cancellation signal requires activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors on the principal neurons. We demonstrate here by immunohistochemistry that the somas and the initial portion of both apical and basal dendrites of the AENs are labeled with antibodies raised against the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors from a South American electric fish. In in vivo physiological experiments, we show that the formation of the cancellation signal induced by coupling an electrosensory stimulus to ventilatory movements or direct parallel fiber stimulation is blocked when either of the NMDA receptor antagonists 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) or MK801 is injected into the molecular layer above the recorded AEN. Blocking NMDA receptors prevented formation of a cancellation signal in 79% (15/19; APV) and 60% (3/5; MK801) of the AENs. This blockage was reversible in 40% (6/15) of the AENs after APV removal. Thus, in the dorsal nucleus, the activity-dependent, long-lasting but reversible change in synaptic strength of the parallel fiber–AEN synapses appears to be an NMDA receptor-dependent process."},{"title":"Thermobiology, energetics and activity patterns of the Eastern tube-nosed bat (Nyctimene robinsoni) in the Australian tropics: effect of temperature and lunar cycle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2557","abstract":"Currently, there are no data on the thermal biology of free-ranging pteropodid bats (Chiroptera). Therefore, our aim was to investigate physiological and behavioural strategies employed by the fruit bat Nyctimene robinsoni (body mass ∼50 g) in winter in tropical Northern Queensland in relation to ambient temperature (Ta) and the lunar cycle. Daily body temperature (Tb) fluctuations in free-ranging bats were measured via radio-telemetry and metabolic rate was measured in captivity via open-flow respirometry (Ta, 15–30°C). Free-ranging bats showed a significant 24 h circadian cycle in Tb, with the lowest Tb at the end of the rest phase just after sunset and the highest Tb at the end of the activity phase just before sunrise. Average daily core Tb ranged from 34.7±0.6 to 37.3±0.8°C (mean ± s.d.) over an average daily Ta range of 17.1±1.1 to 23.5±1.8°C. Tb never fell below 30°C but Tb was significantly reduced during the full moon period compared with that during the new moon period. Tb was correlated with Ta during the second half of the rest phase (P<0.001) but not during the active phase. Resting metabolic rate of bats was significantly affected by Ta (P<0.001, R2=0.856). Our results show that tube-nosed bats exhibit reduced Tb on moonlit nights when they reduce foraging activity, but during our study torpor was not expressed. The energy constraints experienced here by tube-nosed bats with relatively moderate Ta fluctuations, short commuting distances between roosting and feeding locations, and high availability of food were probably not substantial enough to require use of torpor."},{"title":"Kinematic evidence for superfast locomotory muscle in two species of teneriffiid mites","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2551","abstract":"Locomotory muscles typically operate over a narrow range of contraction frequencies, characterized by the predominant fiber types and functional roles. The highest documented frequencies in the synchronous sound-producing muscles of insects (550 Hz) and toadfish (200 Hz) far exceed the contraction frequencies observed in weight-bearing locomotory muscles, which have maximum documented frequencies below 15–30 Hz. Laws of scaling, however, predict that smaller arthropods may employ stride frequencies exceeding this range. In this study we measured running speed and stride frequency in two undescribed species of teneriffiid mites from the coastal sage scrub of southern California. Relative speeds of both species [129–133 body lengths (BL)s–1] are among the fastest documented for any animal. Measured stride frequencies for both species far exceed those documented for any weight-bearing locomotory muscle, with measured values for one species ranging from 93 Hz at 25°C to 111 Hz at 45°C. Stride frequencies either closely approximate or, for one species, exceed predicted values based on an interspecific scaling of frequency and animal mass. Consequently, while the ultra-high frequencies of these muscles must depend on appropriately scaled kinetics of the calcium transient and contraction–relaxation cycle, these do not appear to limit the operating frequencies during running. The predicted low muscle forces operating at these very high frequencies evidently suffice for locomotion, probably because of the larger relative muscle force generated by smaller animals."},{"title":"Immediate spectral flexibility in singing chiffchaffs during experimental exposure to highway noise","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2575","abstract":"Sound plays an important role in the life of many animals, including many bird species. Typically, male birds sing to defend a territory and to attract mates. Ambient noise may negatively affect the signal efficiency of their songs, which may be critical to reproductive success. Consequently, anthropogenic noise may be detrimental to individual birds and to populations in cities and along highways. Several bird species that are still common in urban areas have been shown to sing at higher frequency at locations where there is more low-frequency traffic noise. Here we show that chiffchaffs along noisy highways also sing with a higher minimum frequency than chiffchaffs nearby at a quiet riverside. Furthermore, through experimental exposure to highway noise we show that these birds are capable of making such adjustments over a very short time scale. The first 10 songs sung during the noise exposure revealed an immediate shift to higher frequencies, with a return to pre-exposure levels in recordings without noise the following day. In a transmission re-recording experiment we tested the impact of a potential measurement artifact by recording playback of the same songs repeatedly under different controlled noise conditions. We found an upward shift in the minimum frequency measurement associated with more noisy recordings of the same song, but this artifact was not of a scale that it could explain the noise-dependent spectral shifts in chiffchaffs."},{"title":"Genetic differences in hemoglobin function between highland and lowland deer mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2565","abstract":"In high-altitude vertebrates, adaptive changes in blood–O2 affinity may be mediated by modifications of hemoglobin (Hb) structure that affect intrinsic O2 affinity and/or responsiveness to allosteric effectors that modulate Hb–O2 affinity. This mode of genotypic specialization is considered typical of mammalian species that are high-altitude natives. Here we investigated genetically based differences in Hb–O2 affinity between highland and lowland populations of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), a generalist species that has the broadest altitudinal distribution of any North American mammal. The results of a combined genetic and proteomic analysis revealed that deer mice harbor a high level of Hb isoform diversity that is attributable to allelic polymorphism at two tandemly duplicated α-globin genes and two tandemly duplicated β-globin genes. This high level of isoHb diversity translates into a correspondingly high level of interindividual variation in Hb functional properties. O2 equilibrium experiments revealed that the Hbs of highland mice exhibit slightly higher intrinsic O2 affinities and significantly lower Cl– sensitivities relative to the Hbs of lowland mice. The experiments also revealed distinct biochemical properties of deer mouse Hb related to the anion-dependent allosteric regulation of O2 affinity. In conjunction with previous findings, our results demonstrate that modifications of Hb structure that alter allosteric anion sensitivity play an important role in the adaptive fine-tuning of blood–O2 affinity."},{"title":"On muscle, tendon and high heels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2582","abstract":"Wearing high heels (HH) places the calf muscle–tendon unit (MTU) in a shortened position. As muscles and tendons are highly malleable tissues, chronic use of HH might induce structural and functional changes in the calf MTU. To test this hypothesis, 11 women regularly wearing HH and a control group of 9 women were recruited. Gastrocnemius medialis (GM) fascicle length, pennation angle and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), the Achilles' tendon (AT) length, cross-sectional area (CSA) and mechanical properties, and the plantarflexion torque–angle and torque–velocity relationships were assessed in both groups. Shorter GM fascicle lengths were observed in the HH group (49.6±5.7 mm vs 56.0±7.7 mm), resulting in greater tendon-to-fascicle length ratios. Also, because of greater AT CSA, AT stiffness was higher in the HH group (136.2±26.5 N mm–1 vs 111.3±20.2 N mm–1). However, no differences in the GM PCSA to AT CSA ratio, torque–angle and torque–velocity relationships were found. We conclude that long-term use of high-heeled shoes induces shortening of the GM muscle fascicles and increases AT stiffness, reducing the ankle's active range of motion. Functionally, these two phenomena seem to counteract each other since no significant differences in static or dynamic torques were observed."},{"title":"Developmental plasticity of shell morphology of quagga mussels from shallow and deep-water habitats of the Great Lakes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2602","abstract":"The invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) has quickly colonized shallow-water habitats in the North American Great Lakes since the 1980s but the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) is becoming dominant in both shallow and deep-water habitats. While quagga mussel shell morphology differs between shallow and deep habitats, functional causes and consequences of such difference are unknown. We examined whether quagga mussel shell morphology could be induced by three environmental variables through developmental plasticity. We predicted that shallow-water conditions (high temperature, food quantity, water motion) would yield a morphotype typical of wild quagga mussels from shallow habitats, while deep-water conditions (low temperature, food quantity, water motion) would yield a morphotype present in deep habitats. We tested this prediction by examining shell morphology and growth rate of quagga mussels collected from shallow and deep habitats and reared under common-garden treatments that manipulated the three variables. Shell morphology was quantified using the polar moment of inertia. Of the variables tested, temperature had the greatest effect on shell morphology. Higher temperature (∼18–20°C) yielded a morphotype typical of wild shallow mussels regardless of the levels of food quantity or water motion. In contrast, lower temperature (∼6–8°C) yielded a morphotype approaching that of wild deep mussels. If shell morphology has functional consequences in particular habitats, a plastic response might confer quagga mussels with a greater ability than zebra mussels to colonize a wider range of habitats within the Great Lakes."},{"title":"Opsin co-expression in Limulus photoreceptors: differential regulation by light and a circadian clock","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2589","abstract":"A long-standing concept in vision science has held that a single photoreceptor expresses a single type of opsin, the protein component of visual pigment. However, the number of examples in the literature of photoreceptors from vertebrates and invertebrates that break this rule is increasing. Here, we describe a newly discovered Limulus opsin, Limulus opsin5, which is significantly different from previously characterized Limulus opsins, opsins1 and 2. We show that opsin5 is co-expressed with opsins1 and 2 in Limulus lateral and ventral eye photoreceptors and provide the first evidence that the expression of co-expressed opsins can be differentially regulated. We show that the relative levels of opsin5 and opsin1 and 2 in the rhabdom change with a diurnal rhythm and that their relative levels are also influenced by the animal's central circadian clock. An analysis of the sequence of opsin5 suggests it is sensitive to visible light (400–700 nm) but that its spectral properties may be different from that of opsins1 and 2. Changes in the relative levels of these opsins may underlie some of the dramatic day–night changes in Limulus photoreceptor function and may produce a diurnal change in their spectral sensitivity."},{"title":"Postprandial metabolism of Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/14/2379","abstract":"Specific dynamic action (SDA) is defined as the energy expended during ingestion, digestion, absorption and assimilation of a meal.

The median brain cooling was about 1°C during 15 min diving, but in some cases it was as much as 2.5°C. Cooling rates were slow for the first couple of minutes, but increased significantly after about 5 min of diving. The onset of cooling sometimes occurred before the start of the dive, confirming that the cooling is under cortical control, like the rest of the diving responses. Taorta also fell significantly, and was always lower than Tbrain, while Tm was fairly stable during dives. Detailed studies of the vascular anatomy of front flippers revealed that brachial arterial blood can be routed either through flipper skin capillaries for nutritive purposes and return through sophisticated vascular heat exchangers to avoid heat loss to the environment, or, alternatively, through numerous arterio-venous shunts in the skin and return by way of large superficial veins, which then carry cold blood to the heart. In the latter situation the extent to which the brain is cooled is determined by the ratio of carotid to brachial arterial blood flow, and water temperature, and the cooling is selective in that only those organs that are circulated will be cooled. It is concluded that Tbrain is actively down-regulated during diving, sometimes by as much as 2.5°C, whereby cerebral oxygen requirements may be reduced by as much as 25% during extended dives."},{"title":"In vivo bite and grip forces, morphology and prey-killing behavior of North American accipiters (Accipitridae) and falcons (Falconidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/15/2617","abstract":"Raptors exhibit a diversity of strategies to procure their prey but ultimately kill using their beaks and/or talons. Thus, bite and grip forces are ecologically important variables that have direct survival implications. Whereas hawks rely primarily on their feet for killing prey, falcons tend to employ their beaks. Consequently, falcons are expected to achieve relatively greater bite forces, and hawks are expected to generate relatively greater grip forces. Force estimates predicted from musculoskeletal morphology in a previous study indicated that falcons (Falco spp.) possess greater jaw force capabilities than accipiters (Accipiter spp.) but there were no clear differences in predicted grip-force capacity outside of differences in scaling. The objective of this study was to complement those results with measurements of in vivo forces by inducing captive and wild accipiters and falcons to bite and grasp force transducers. Bite force increased isometrically in both groups whereas grip force tended toward positive allometry. After adjusting for body mass, falcons produced greater bite forces, and accipiters produced greater grip forces. Thus, previous anatomical estimates of forces predicted the expected direction and magnitude of differences in bite forces but the overall greater in vivo grip forces of accipiters deviated from the pattern obtained from biomechanical estimates. Although the scaling relationships were similar between data sets, forces generated by live birds were consistently lower than those predicted from biomechanics. Estimated and in vivo jaw and digital forces were nevertheless correlated, and therefore provide an important link between morphology and killing behavior in these raptors."},{"title":"Jumping mechanisms and performance of pygmy mole crickets (Orthoptera, Tridactylidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/14/2386","abstract":"Pygmy mole crickets live in burrows at the edge of water and jump powerfully to avoid predators such as the larvae and adults of tiger beetles that inhabit the same microhabitat. Adults are 5–6 mm long and weigh 8 mg. The hind legs are dominated by enormous femora containing the jumping muscles and are 131% longer than the body. The ratio of leg lengths is: 1:2.1:4.5 (front:middle:hind, respectively). The hind tarsi are reduced and their role is supplanted by two pairs of tibial spurs that can rotate through 180 deg. During horizontal walking the hind legs are normally held off the ground. Jumps are propelled by extension of the hind tibiae about the femora at angular velocities of 68,000 deg s−1 in 2.2 ms, as revealed by images captured at rates of 5000 s−1. The two hind legs usually move together but can move asynchronously, and many jumps are propelled by just one hind leg. The take-off angle is steep and once airborne the body rotates backwards about its transverse axis (pitch) at rates of 100 Hz or higher. The take-off velocity, used to define the best jumps, can reach 5.4 m s−1, propelling the insect to heights of 700 mm and distances of 1420 mm with an acceleration of 306 g. The head and pronotum are jerked rapidly as the body is accelerated. Jumping on average uses 116 μJ of energy, requires a power output of 50 mW and exerts a force of 20 mN. In jumps powered by one hind leg the figures are about 40% less."},{"title":"Co-variation between autotrophy and heterotrophy in the Mediterranean coral Cladocora caespitosa","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/14/2399","abstract":"This study quantifies the relative contributions of autotrophy and heterotrophy to the energy budget of the temperate scleractinian species Cladocora caespitosa Linnaeus 1767. Colonies were incubated under different light and feeding regimes, and changes in carbon acquisition through photosynthesis and feeding were measured during a 2-month time period. This approach allowed us to quantify the rate at which adjustments to physiology occurred, as well as the magnitude of up- or downregulation of both feeding modes. In addition, we explored how shifts in carbon acquisition mode influenced tissue biomass (protein content), energy stores (lipid content) and colony growth (calcification). Increases in feeding capacity during prolonged exposure to darkness were correlated with decreases in photosynthetic capacity. However, feeding effort did not decrease when photosynthesis was high. In fact, feeding was maximal under high light conditions when food was not available. During starvation, colonies used their lipid stores to partially meet their metabolic requirements. Colonies kept in low light used nutrients from feeding to supplement calcification, whereas those kept at high light converted carbon from feeding into tissue biomass. This work provides the first estimates of rates of adjustment of heterotrophic feeding capacity in a Mediterranean scleractinian coral. For the study species, flexibility in carbon acquisition through heterotrophy was approximately equal to flexibility in photosynthesis both in magnitude and in the rate at which physiological adjustments occurred. The ability to alter feeding effort rapidly and strongly may explain the wide depth distribution of C. caespitosa, and its ability to survive in turbid coastal waters where light is often limited."},{"title":"Selection of entomopathogenic nematodes for enhanced responsiveness to a volatile root signal helps to control a major root pest","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/14/2417","abstract":"The efficacy of natural enemies as biological control agents against insect pests can theoretically be enhanced by artificial selection for high responsiveness to foraging cues. The recent discovery that maize roots damaged by the western corn rootworm (WCR) emit a key attractant for insect-killing nematodes has opened the way to explore whether a selection strategy can improve the control of root pests. The compound in question, (E)-β-caryophyllene, is only weakly attractive to Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, one of the most infectious nematodes against WCR. To overcome this drawback, we used a six-arm below-ground olfactometer to select for a strain of H. bacteriophora that is more readily attracted to (E)-β-caryophyllene. After six generations of selection, the selected strain responded considerably better and moved twice as rapidly towards a (E)-β-caryophyllene source than the original strain. There was a minor trade-off between this enhanced responsiveness and nematode infectiveness. Yet, in subsequent field tests, the selected strain was significantly more effective than the original strain in reducing WCR populations in plots with a maize variety that releases (E)-β-caryophyllene, but not in plots with a maize variety that does not emit this root signal.

Even though adult Drosophila can survive in 0% oxygen (anoxia) environments for hours, air with less than 2% oxygen rapidly induces locomotory failure resulting in an anoxic coma. We use natural genetic variation and an induced mutation in the foraging (for) gene, which encodes a Drosophila PKG, to demonstrate that the onset of anoxic coma is correlated with PKG activity. Flies that have lower PKG activity demonstrate a significant increase in time to the onset of anoxic coma. Further, in vivo pharmacological manipulations reveal that reducing either PKG or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity increases tolerance of behavior to acute hypoxic conditions. Alternatively, PKG activation and phosphodiesterase (PDE5/6) inhibition significantly reduce the time to the onset of anoxic coma. By manipulating these targets in paired combinations, we characterized a specific PKG cascade, with upstream and downstream components. Further, using genetic variants of PKG expression/activity subjected to chronic anoxia over 6 h, ~50% of animals with higher PKG activity survive, while only ~25% of those with lower PKG activity survive after a 24 h recovery. Therefore, in this report we describe the PKG pathway and the differential protection of function vs survival in a critically low oxygen environment."},{"title":"Effects of nutritional condition on spring migration: do migrants use resource availability to keep pace with a changing world?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/14/2424","abstract":"Because of their reliance on temporally predictable resources across large spatial scales, migratory birds may be especially vulnerable to anthropogenic climate and land-use changes. Although some long-distance migrants appear unable to adjust to phenological shifts on their wintering grounds, several short- and medium-distance migrants appear to have altered the timing and/or distance of their yearly movements to compensate for the environmental effects of global warming. Which environmental cues are responsible for stimulating these adjustments is an unanswered question, although most studies have focused on weather conditions. Here, we present a novel field experiment that demonstrates that an alternative cue, food availability, may be a crucial link between local conditions on the wintering grounds and the timing of spring departure. When we provided dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) with an abundant food supply in early spring, we observed an advance in migration, especially among individuals that increased their mass and fat stores in response to the treatment.

Movement in aquatic organisms can also be strongly affected by abiotic factors such as the viscosity of the medium. We examined the effects of both biotic factors and abiotic factors on buccal pumping kinematics in Xenopus tadpoles using high-speed imaging of an ontogenetic series of tadpoles combined with experimental manipulation of the medium over a 10-fold range of viscosity. We found influences of both biotic and abiotic factors on tadpole movements; absolute velocities and excursions of the jaws and hyoid were greater in higher viscosity fluid but durations of movements were unaffected. Smaller tadpoles have relatively wider heads and more robust hyoid muscles used in buccal expansion and compression. Lever arm ratios were found to be constant at all sizes; therefore, smaller tadpoles have relatively higher resolved muscle forces and, like tadpoles in more viscous medium, displayed higher absolute velocities of jaw and hyoid movements. Nonetheless, small tadpoles drew in water at lower Reynolds numbers (Re) than predicted by kinematics, due to negative allometry of the buccal pump. Finally, tadpoles transitioned from a flow regime dominated by viscous forces (Re=2) to an intermediate regime (Re=106)."},{"title":"The ultrastructure and contractile properties of a fast-acting, obliquely striated, myosin-regulated muscle: the funnel retractor of squids","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/14/2430","abstract":"We investigated the ultrastructure, contractile properties, and in vivo length changes of the fast-acting funnel retractor muscle of the long-finned squid Doryteuthis pealeii.

The contractile apparatus consists of ‘myofibrils’ ~0.25–0.5 μm wide in cross section arrayed around the periphery of each cell, surrounding a central core that contains the nucleus and large mitochondria.

Our physiological experiments, conducted at 17°C, showed that the longitudinal muscle fibers of the funnel retractor were activated rapidly (8 ms latent period following stimulation) and generated force rapidly (peak twitch force occurred within 50 ms). The longitudinal fibers had low Vmax (2.15 ±0.26 L0 s−1, where L0 was the length that generated peak isometric force) but generated relatively high isometric stress (270±20 mN mm−2 physiological cross section).

During the exhalant phase of the jet the range of strains was even narrower: maximum range less than ±0.04, with the muscle operating nearly isometrically during ventilation and slow, arms-first swimming.

Our bearing choice analysis also revealed that gannets anticipate the general direction of their foraging area during the first 30 min and the first 10 km of the trip.

Motion detected by the secondary eyes may elicit an orienting response, whereupon the object of interest is examined further using the high-acuity principal eyes. The anterior lateral (AL) eyes are particularly interesting, as they are the only forward-facing pair of secondary eyes. In this study, we aimed to determine characteristics of stimuli that elicit orienting responses mediated by the AL eyes. After covering all eyes except the AL eyes, we measured orienting responses to dot stimuli that varied in size and contrast, and moved at different speeds. We found that all stimulus parameters had significant effects on orientation propensity. When tethered flies were used as prey, we found that visual information from the AL eyes alone was sufficient to elicit stalking behaviour. These results suggest that, in terms of overall visual processing, the relevance of spatial vision in the AL eyes has been underestimated in the literature. Our results also show that female spiders are significantly more responsive than males. We found that hunger caused similar increases in orientation propensity in the two sexes, but females responded more often than males both when sated and when hungry. A higher propensity by females to orient toward moving objects may be related to females tending to experience higher nutritional demands than males."},{"title":"Cave-dwelling bats do not avoid TMT and 2-PT – components of predator odour that induce fear in other small mammals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/14/2453","abstract":"Recognition and avoidance of predators is fundamental for the survival of prey animals. Here we conducted the first study assessing chemosensory predator recognition in cave-dwelling bats. We used a Y-maze approach to test the reaction of greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) to two synthetically derived components of predator odour (2,4,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline, TMT, a component of fox faeces scent; and 2-propylthietane, 2-PT, a component of mustelid scent) and to the natural scent of the least weasel (Mustela nivalis). It is well documented that rodents and several other small mammals show strong and at least partly innate fear reactions when confronted with these odorants. By contrast, the bats did not show any avoidance or fear reaction, despite the fact that relatively high odorant concentrations were presented. Furthermore, they did not react differently towards predator scent and towards acrid but otherwise neutral odours (basil or goat). The number of entries into in the Y-maze arm with the odour source and the time spent in this arm as well as the bats' overall exploratory activity and several other behavioural variables were not affected by the odour treatments. Generally, the sense of smell is well developed in bats and plays an important role in bat behavioural ecology. It is thus somewhat surprising that the bats did not show any avoidance reaction to predator scent, even though direct contact with a mustelid or fox would result in death. We discuss ecological explanations that might have prevented bats from evolving olfactory predatory recognition and avoidance."},{"title":"Effects of nutritional condition on spring migration: do migrants use resource availability to keep pace with a changing world?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/14/2424","abstract":"Because of their reliance on temporally predictable resources across large spatial scales, migratory birds may be especially vulnerable to anthropogenic climate and land-use changes.

Three hoverflies were considered. By taking out the camber deformation and the spanwise twist deformation one by one and by comparing the results of the deformable wing with those of the rigid flat-plate wing (the angle of attack of the rigid flat-plate wing was equal to the local angle of attack at the radius of the second moment of wing area of the deformable wing), effects of camber deformation and spanwise twist were identified. The main results are as follows. For the hovering hoverflies considered, the time courses of the lift, drag and aerodynamic power coefficients of the deformable wing are very similar to their counterparts of the rigid flat-plate wing, although lift of the deformable wing is about 10% larger, and its aerodynamic power required about 5% less than that of the rigid flat-plate wing. The difference in lift is mainly caused by the camber deformation, and the difference in power is mainly caused by the spanwise twist. The main reason that the deformation does not have a very large effect on the aerodynamic force is that, during hovering, the wing operates at a very high angle of attack (about 50 deg) and the flow is separated, and separated flow is not very sensitive to wing deformation. Thus, as a first approximation, the deformable wing in hover flight could be modeled by a rigid flat-plate wing with its angle of attack being equal to the local angle of attack at the radius of second moment of wing area of the deformable wing."},{"title":"Collision avoidance by running insects: antennal guidance in cockroaches","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2294","abstract":"Cockroaches were observed with videographic methods as escape running was initiated, but with obstacles in the path of their run. The goal was to determine the repertoire of possible responses to obstacles and the sensory cues used to trigger the responses. Intact cockroaches collided with obstacles on only about 10% of trials. The most common collision avoidance strategy was simply to stop running prior to impact. However, occasionally animals moved vertically and climbed over the barrier, or turned and navigated an edge of the obstacle, or completely reversed run direction. The avoidance strategies chosen depended on the size and configuration of the obstacle. Tests for the use of vision in detecting obstacles showed that its role, if any, is small. However, all manipulations that altered the antennal system changed behavior in a way consistent with the hypothesis that antennal mechanosensation plays a major role in collision avoidance. For example, reducing antennal length, or severing the main antennal nerve without altering the length produced significant increases in the frequency of collisions. Tests with tethered insects showed that (1) the antennae are preferentially directed forward as animals run, and (2) nearly simultaneous contact with both antennae is required to make the cockroach stop. Our data indicate that running cockroaches employ strategies that set their sensorimotor systems in a mode of readiness to deal with obstacles and they suggest that sensory information about the presence and configuration of obstacles is used to make choices, at very short latencies, about how to respond to obstructions."},{"title":"The effects of turbulent eddies on the stability and critical swimming speed of creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2284","abstract":"The effect of turbulent eddy diameter, vorticity and orientation on the 2 min critical swimming speed and stability of creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) is reported. Turbulent eddies were visualized and their properties were quantified using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Flow fields with an increasing range in eddy diameter were created by inserting cylinder arrays upstream from the swimming test section. Eddy vorticity increased with increasing velocity. Two orientations of eddies, eddies spinning about a vertical axis and eddies spinning about a horizontal (wall-to-wall) axis, were investigated. Stability challenges were not observed until the largest (95th percentile) eddy diameters reached 76% of the fish body total length. Under these conditions fish were observed to spin in an orientation consistent with the rotational axis of the large eddies and translate downstream. These losses in postural control were termed ‘spills’. Spills were 230% more frequent and lasted 24% longer in turbulent flow fields dominated by horizontal eddies than by vertical eddies of the same diameter. The onset of spills coincided with a 10% and 22% reduction in critical swimming speed in turbulent flows dominated by large vertical and horizontal eddies, respectively. These observations confirm predictions by Pavlov et al., Cada and Odeh, Lupandin, and Liao that the eddy diameter, vorticity and orientation play an important role in the swimming capacity of fishes."},{"title":"Motor patterns associated with crawling in a soft-bodied arthropod","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2303","abstract":"Soft-bodied animals lack distinct joints and levers, and so their locomotion is expected to be controlled differently from that of animals with stiff skeletons. Some invertebrates, such as the annelids, use functionally antagonistic muscles (circumferential and longitudinal) acting on constant-volume hydrostatics to produce extension and contraction. These processes form the basis for most theoretical considerations of hydrostatic locomotion in organisms including larval insects. However, caterpillars do not move in this way, and their powerful appendages provide grip independent of their dimensional changes. Here, we show that the anterograde wave of movement seen in the crawling tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is mediated by co-activation of dorsal and ventral muscles within a body segment, rather than by antiphasic activation, as previously believed. Furthermore, two or three abdominal segments are in swing phase simultaneously, and the activities of motor neurons controlling major longitudinal muscles overlap in more than four segments. Recordings of muscle activity during natural crawling show that some are activated during both their shortening and elongation. These results do not support the typical peristaltic model of crawling, but they do support a tension-based model of crawling, in which the substrate is utilized as an anchor to generate propulsion."},{"title":"Evidence for glutamate, GABA and NO in coordinating behaviour in the sponge, Ephydatia muelleri (Demospongiae, Spongillidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2310","abstract":"The view that sponges lack tissue level organisation, epithelia, sensory cells and coordinated behaviour is challenged by recent molecular studies showing the existence in Porifera of molecules and proteins that define cell signalling systems in higher order metazoans. Demonstration that freshwater sponges can contract their canals in an organised manner in response to both external and endogenous stimuli prompted us to examine the physiology of the contraction behaviour. Using a combination of digital time-lapse microscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS) analysis, immunocytochemistry and pharmacological manipulations, we tested the role of the diffusible amino acids glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and a short-lived diffusible gas, nitric oxide (NO), in triggering or modulating contractions in Ephydatia muelleri. We identified pools of glutamate, glutamine and GABA used to maintain a metabotropic glutamate and GABA receptor signalling system. Glutamate induced contractions and propagation of a stereotypical behaviour inflating and deflating the canal system, acting in a dose-dependent manner. Glutamate-triggered contractions were blocked by the metabatropic glutamate receptor inhibitor AP3 and by incubation of the sponge in an allosteric competitive inhibitor of glutamate, Kynurenic acid. Incubation in GABA inhibited glutamate-triggered contractions of the sponge. Nitric oxide synthase, involved in the formation of the diffusible gas NO, was localised using NADPH-diaphorase to mesenchyme cells in the osculum and pinacoderm. A cGMP assay showed the same cells were labelled suggesting that the NO system is functional. Our findings suggest sponges coordinate behaviour using chemical messenger systems common to other animals."},{"title":"Effect of laboratory acclimation on the variation of reproduction-related characters in Drosophila melanogaster","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2322","abstract":"The natural variation of sex-specific characters between populations can favor their behavioral isolation, eventually leading to the formation of new species. Marked variations for male courtship, mating and the production of sex pheromones – three complex characters potentially inducing sexual isolation – were found between Drosophila melanogaster populations of various origins acclimated for many generations in research laboratories. However, the natural variation of these three characters between natural populations and their evolution after long-term acclimation in the laboratory remains unknown. We measured many traits involved in these characters in six stocks initiated with distinct populations sampled in a restricted geographic area. Several sex-specific traits varied between stocks freshly brought back to the laboratory. After 100 generations spent in the laboratory without any experimental selection, traits varied in a strain-dependent manner. This variation was not related to a reduction of their variance except for copulation duration. This indicates that reproduction-related characters can diverge between neighboring D. melanogaster populations, and differently adapt to stable laboratory conditions."},{"title":"Partition of aerobic and anaerobic swimming costs related to gait transitions in a labriform swimmer","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2177","abstract":"Members of the family Embiotocidae exhibit a distinct gait transition from exclusively pectoral fin oscillation to combined pectoral and caudal fin propulsion with increasing swimming speed. The pectoral–caudal gait transition occurs at a threshold speed termed Up–c. The objective of this study was to partition aerobic and anaerobic swimming costs at speeds below and above the Up–c in the striped surfperch Embiotoca lateralis using swimming respirometry and video analysis to test the hypothesis that the gait transition marks the switch from aerobic to anaerobic power output. Exercise oxygen consumption rate was measured at 1.4, 1.9 and 2.3 L s–1. The presence and magnitude of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) were evaluated after each swimming speed. The data demonstrated that 1.4 L s–1 was below the Up–c, whereas 1.9 and 2.3 L s–1 were above the Up–c. These last two swimming speeds included caudal fin propulsion in a mostly steady and unsteady (burst-assisted) mode, respectively. There was no evidence of EPOC after swimming at 1.4 and 1.9 L s–1, indicating that the pectoral–caudal gait transition was not a threshold for anaerobic metabolism. At 2.3 L s–1, E. lateralis switched to an unsteady burst and flap gait. This swimming speed resulted in EPOC, suggesting that anaerobic metabolism constituted 25% of the total costs. Burst activity correlated positively with the magnitude of the EPOC. Collectively, these data indicate that steady axial propulsion does not lead to EPOC whereas transition to burst-assisted swimming above Up–c is associated with anaerobic metabolism in this labriform swimmer."},{"title":"Snout allometry in seahorses: insights on optimisation of pivot feeding performance during ontogeny","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2184","abstract":"As juvenile life-history stages are subjected to strong selection, these stages often show levels of performance approaching those of adults, or show a disproportionately rapid increase of performance with age. Although testing performance capacity in aquatic suction feeders is often problematic, in pivot feeders such as seahorses models have been proposed to estimate whether snout length is optimal to minimise the time needed to reach the prey. Here, we investigate whether the same model can also explain the snout lengths in an ontogenetic series of seahorses, explore how pivot feeding kinematics change during ontogeny, and test whether juveniles show disproportionate levels of performance. Our analysis shows that the dimensions of the snout change during ontogeny from short and broad to long and narrow. Model calculations show that the snout lengths of newborn and juvenile seahorses are nearly optimal for minimising prey reach time. However, in juveniles the centre of head rotation in the earth-bound frame of reference is located near the posterior end of the head, whereas in adults it is shifted forward and is located approximately above the eye. Modelling shows that this forward shift in the centre of rotation has the advantage of decreasing the moment of inertia and the torque required to rotate the head, but has the disadvantage of slightly increasing the time needed to reach the prey. Thus, the snout lengths of juvenile seahorses appear to be close to optimal, suggesting that they reach levels of performance close to adult levels, which illustrates the pervasive nature of selection on performance in juveniles."},{"title":"Hydrodynamic determination of the moving direction of an artificial fin by a harbour seal (Phoca vitulina)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2194","abstract":"Harbour seals can use their vibrissal system to detect and follow hydrodynamic trails left by moving objects. In this study we determined the maximum time after which a harbour seal could indicate the moving direction of an artificial fish tail and analysed the hydrodynamic parameters allowing the discrimination. Hydrodynamic trails were generated using a fin-like paddle moving from left to right or from right to left in the calm water of an experimental box. The blindfolded seal was able to recognise the direction of the paddle movement when the hydrodynamic trail was up to 35 s old. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) revealed that the seal might have perceived and used two different hydrodynamic parameters to determine the moving direction of the fin-like paddle. The structure and spatial arrangement of the vortices in the hydrodynamic trail and high water velocities between two counter-rotating vortices are characteristic of the movement direction and are within the sensory range of the seal."},{"title":"The mechanical function of linked muscles in the guinea fowl hind limb","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2201","abstract":"Although mechanical linkages between the proximal and distal limb are present in a range of species, their functional significance is unknown. We have investigated the mechanical function of the flexor cruris lateralis pars pelvica (FCLP), flexor cruris lateralis pars accessoria (FCLA) and gastrocnemius intermedia (GI), a system of linked muscles spanning proximal and distal limb segments in the guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) hind limb. The FCLP, which is in the anatomical position of a hamstring muscle, is the primary component of the linkage. It is connected to the distal femur via the FCLA, the tarsometatarsus via the tendon of insertion of the GI and the common Achilles tendon, and the tibiotarsus via a distal tendon of insertion. The FCLP may, therefore, potentially exert moments at the hip, knee and ankle joints depending on the joint angles and the relative states of activation in the three muscles. Evidence presented here suggests that the GI and FCLA act as actively controlled links that alter distal action of the FCLP. The FCLP and GI are coactive in the late swing and early stance phases of the stride, forming a triarticular complex, and likely act together to resist and control ankle flexion immediately after foot-down in addition to providing hip extension and knee flexion moments. The FCLP and FCLA are coactive from mid-through to late stance, acting together as a uniarticular hip extensor. Available evidence suggests that this role of the FCLP and FCLA is of increased importance in inclined running and accelerations. This linkage between a proximal muscle and alternate distal connections allows for functional flexibility, both in terms of the site at which the muscle exerts force and the nature of the muscle's mechanical function. The interactions generated between the proximal and distal limb by linkages of this type suggest that less emphasis should be placed on the distinct functional roles of specific anatomical classes of muscle within proximal and distal limb segments."},{"title":"Asymmetry of different brain structures in homing pigeons with and without navigational experience","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2219","abstract":"Homing pigeons (Columba livia f.d.) are well-known for their homing abilities, and their brains seem to be functionally adapted to homing as exemplified, e.g. by their larger hippocampi and olfactory bulbs. Their hippocampus size is influenced by navigational experience, and, as in other birds, functional specialisation of the left and right hemispheres (‘lateralisation’) occurs in homing pigeons. To show in what way lateralisation is reflected in brain structure volume, and whether some lateralisation or asymmetry in homing pigeons is caused by experience, we compared brains of homing pigeons with and without navigational experience referring to this. Fourteen homing pigeons were raised under identical constraints. After fledging, seven of them were allowed to fly around the loft and participated successfully in races. The other seven stayed permanently in the loft and thus did not share the navigational experiences of the first group. After reaching sexual maturity, all individuals were killed and morphometric analyses were carried out to measure the volumes of five basic brain parts and eight telencephalic brain parts. Measurements of telencephalic brain parts and optic tectum were done separately for the left and right hemispheres. The comparison of left/right quotients of both groups reveal that pigeons with navigational experience show a smaller left mesopallium in comparison with the right mesopallium and pigeons without navigational experience a larger left mesopallium in comparison with the right one. Additionally, there are significant differences between left and right brain subdivisions within the two pigeon groups, namely a larger left hyperpallium apicale in both pigeon groups and a larger right nidopallium, left hippocampus and right optic tectum in pigeons with navigational experience. Pigeons without navigational experience did not show more significant differences between their left and right brain subdivisions. The results of our study confirm that the brain of homing pigeons is an example for mosaic evolution and indicates that lateralisation is correlated with individual life history (experience) and not exclusively based on heritable traits."},{"title":"Oxidative stress and information content of black and yellow plumage coloration: an experiment with greenfinches","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2225","abstract":"Carotenoid and melanin pigments in the plumage of birds are hypothesized to be sensitive to oxidative stress. We manipulated oxidative status of captive greenfinches (Carduelis chloris L.) by the administration of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a selective inhibitor of the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), an intracellular antioxidant. Half of the birds in the treated group, as well as in the control group, also received dietary carotenoid (lutein) supplementation. BSO treatment reduced erythrocyte GSH levels and caused oxidative damage as indicated by the increased concentration of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid peroxidation. BSO treatment also reduced the brightness (i.e. increased blackness) of the tips of tail feathers grown during the experiment. These results show that a low systemic GSH level is required for development of eumelanin plumage coloration and that such a low GSH level is also potentially dangerous for the organism. Carotenoid supplementation increased plasma carotenoid levels and chroma of the yellow parts of the feathers grown during the experiment. However, carotenoid supplementation did not reduce plasma MDA levels. Manipulation of GSH did not affect plasma carotenoids or carotenoid-based plumage coloration. These findings argue against the antioxidant function of lutein in vivo and carotenoid signaling of antioxidant status."},{"title":"Oxygen limitation and thermal tolerance in two terrestrial arthropod species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2209","abstract":"Recent studies of marine invertebrates and fish have suggested that lower and upper critical temperatures (CTmin and CTmax) are coupled by a common mechanism: oxygen and capacity limitation of thermal tolerance (OCLT).

Critical temperatures were identified as particular points on both activity and <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/213/13/2209/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/> traces in four ways.

Minimum and maximum metabolic rates were determined using CO2 traces, and the temperatures corresponding to these identified as TMetMin and TMetMax. For both species, ambient oxygen concentration did not influence CTmin, minimum metabolic rate, or TMetMin. By contrast, severe hypoxia (2.5% O2) caused a 6.9°C decline in activity-based CTmax for T. molitor and a 10.6°C decline for P. scaber, relative to normoxia (21% O2). The magnitude of this decrease differed between methods used to estimated critical thermal limits, highlighting the need for a standard method to determine these endpoints during thermolimit respirometry. Maximum metabolic rate also declined with decreasing ambient oxygen in both species. The combination of increasing metabolic rate and oxygen limitation affected upper thermal limits in these arthropods only in severe hypoxia (2.5% O2). In both species, CTmin and CTmax responded differently to oxygen limitation, suggesting that this is not a common mechanism coupling upper and lower limits in terrestrial arthropods."},{"title":"Chirping response of weakly electric knife fish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) to low-frequency electric signals and to heterospecific electric fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2234","abstract":"Brown ghost knife fish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) can briefly increase their electric organ discharge (EOD) frequency to produce electrocommunication signals termed chirps. The chirp rate increases when fish are presented with conspecific fish or high-frequency (700–1100 Hz) electric signals that mimic conspecific fish. We examined whether A. leptorhynchus also chirps in response to artificial low-frequency electric signals and to heterospecific electric fish whose EOD contains low-frequency components. Fish chirped at rates above background when presented with low-frequency (10–300 Hz) sine-wave stimuli; at 30 and 150 Hz, the threshold amplitude for response was 1 mV cm–1. Low-frequency (30 Hz) stimuli also potentiated the chirp response to high-frequency (∼900 Hz) stimuli. Fish increased their chirp rate when presented with two heterospecific electric fish, Sternopygus macrurus and Brachyhypopomus gauderio, but did not respond to the presence of the non-electric fish Carassius auratus. Fish chirped to low-frequency (150 Hz) signals that mimic those of S. macrurus and to EOD playbacks of B. gauderio. The response to the B. gauderio playback was reduced when the low-frequency component (<150 Hz) was experimentally filtered out. Thus, A. leptorhynchus appears to chirp specifically to the electric signals of heterospecific electric fish, and the low-frequency components of heterospecific EODs significantly influence chirp rate. These results raise the possibility that chirps function to communicate to conspecifics about the presence of a heterospecific fish or to communicate directly to heterospecific fish."},{"title":"The fish eye view: are cichlids conspicuous?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2243","abstract":"The extent of animal colouration is determined by an interplay between natural and sexual selection. Both forces probably shape colouration in the speciose, rock-dwelling cichlids of Lake Malawi. Sexual selection is thought to drive male colouration, overcoming natural selection to create conspicuous colour patterns via female mate choice and male–male competition. However, natural selection should make female cichlids cryptic because they mouthbrood their young. We hypothesize that as a result of both sexual and natural selection, males will have colours that are more conspicuous than female colours. Cichlid spectral sensitivity, especially in the ultraviolet, probably influences how colours appear to them. Here we use simple models of the trichromatic colour space of cichlid visual systems to compare the conspicuousness of male and female nuptial colours of nine species. Conspicuousness of colours was evaluated as their Euclidian distance in colour space from environmental backgrounds and from other colours on the same fish. We find in six of the nine species that breeding males have colours that are statistically more conspicuous than female colours. These colours contrast strongly with each other or with the backgrounds, and they fall within a range of spectra best transmitted in the habitat. Female colour distances were sometimes smaller, suggesting that females of some species are more cryptic than males. Therefore, selection can differentially act to generate male colours that are more conspicuous than those in females. However, in two species, females had colours that were more conspicuous than male colours, suggesting that other selective forces and possibly sexual conflicts are acting in this system."},{"title":"Neuropeptides in the Drosophila central complex in modulation of locomotor behavior","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2256","abstract":"The central complex is one of the most prominent neuropils in the insect brain. It has been implicated in the control of locomotor activity and is considered as a pre-motor center. Several neuropeptides are expressed in circuits of the central complex, and thus may be modulators of locomotor behavior. Here we have investigated the roles of two different neuropeptides, Drosophila tachykinin (DTK) and short neuropeptide F (sNPF), in aspects of locomotor behavior. In the Drosophila brain, DTK and sNPF are expressed in interneurons innervating the central complex. We have directed RNA interference (RNAi) towards DTK and sNPF specifically in different central complex neurons. We also expressed a temperature-sensitive dominant negative allele of the fly ortholog of dynamin called shibirets1, essential in membrane vesicle recycling and endocytosis, to disrupt synaptic transmission in central complex neurons. The spontaneous walking activity of the RNAi- or shibirets1-expressing flies was quantified by video tracking. DTK-deficient flies displayed drastically increased center zone avoidance, suggesting that DTK is involved in the regulation of spatial orientation. In addition, DTK deficiency in other central complex neurons resulted in flies with an increased number of activity–rest bouts. Perturbations in the sNPF circuit indicated that this peptide is involved in the fine regulation of locomotor activity levels. Our findings suggest that the contribution of DTK and sNPF to locomotor behavior is circuit dependent and associated with particular neuronal substrates. Thus, peptidergic pathways in the central complex have specific roles in the fine tuning of locomotor activity of adult Drosophila."},{"title":"Chewing rates among domestic dog breeds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2266","abstract":"The mammalian masticatory rhythm is produced by a brainstem timing network. The rhythm is relatively fixed within individual animals but scales allometrically with body mass (Mb) across species. It has been hypothesized that sensory feedback and feed-forward adjust the rhythm to match the jaw's natural resonance frequency, with allometric scaling being an observable consequence. However, studies performed with adult animals show that the rhythm is not affected by jaw mass manipulations, indicating that either developmental or evolutionary mechanisms are required for allometry to become manifest. The present study was performed to tease out the relative effects of development versus natural selection on chewing rate allometry. Thirty-one dog breeds and 31 mass-matched non-domestic mammalian species with a range in Mb from ∼2 kg to 50 kg were studied. Results demonstrated that the chewing rhythm did not scale with Mb among dog breeds (R=0.299, P>0.10) or with jaw length (Lj) (R=0.328, P>0.05). However, there was a significant relationship between the chewing rhythm and Mb among the non-domestic mammals (R=0.634, P<0.001). These results indicate that scaling is not necessary in the adult animal. We conclude that the central timing network and related sensorimotor systems may be necessary for rhythm generation but they do not explain the 1/3rd to 1/4th allometric scaling observed among adult mammals. The rhythm of the timing network is either adjusted to the physical parameters of the jaw system during early development only, is genetically determined independently of the jaw system or is uniquely hard-wired among dogs and laboratory rodents."},{"title":"Cardiovascular performance of six species of field-acclimatized centrarchid sunfish during the parental care period","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2332","abstract":"Parental care is an energetically costly period of the life history of many fish species characterized by extended high intensity activity.

Using Doppler flow probes, the cardiovascular performance of six syntopic centrarchid fish species (N=232) that provide sole, male parental care was examined across a range of water temperatures that encompass their reproductive periods (14–26°C). Experiments were restricted to males but included both nesting and non-nesting individuals to evaluate the cardiovascular performance of fish during parental care. Resting values for cardiac output (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/213/13/2332/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>) and heart rate (fH) tended to be higher for nesting fish when adjusted for variation in temperature. Both of these cardiac variables also increased with water temperature. Stroke volume (VS) was similar among nesting and non-nesting fish and was generally thermally insensitive. When exposed to exhaustive exercise, nesting fish took longer to exhaust than non-nesting individuals. The high resting levels found in nesting fish accompanied by only minor increases in maximal values typically resulted in reductions in cardiac scope. Cardiovascular variables recovered more quickly in nesting fish, which could facilitate the high activity and bursting associated with parental care. Interspecifically, several cardiovascular variables were correlated with parental care activity. Parental care investment became more energetically expensive as the degree of cardiac frequency modulation decreased. Additionally, as the duration of parental care increased, so did the time required for fish to become exhausted, although this relationship was probably influenced by the fact that the larger species (e.g. smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu; largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides) provided the lengthiest care. Collectively, these data indicate that fish that provide parental care possess adaptations, including sufficient phenotypic plasticity, such that they can enhance their ability to provide high intensity protracted care, and emphasize the nexus between behavior and physiology."},{"title":"Slow waves during sleep in crayfish.

To study the temporal organization of such activity, we developed a tethered crayfish preparation that allows us to place electrodes on visually identified regions of the brain. Recording the electrical activity of different brain areas shows that when the animal is active (awake), slow waves are present only in the central complex. However, simultaneously with the animal becoming limp (sleeping), slow waves spread first to deuto- and then to protocerebrum, suggesting that the central complex of the crayfish brain acts as the sleep generator."},{"title":"Inhibition of glutamine synthetase during ammonia exposure in rainbow trout indicates a high reserve capacity to prevent brain ammonia toxicity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/13/2343","abstract":"Glutamine synthetase (GSase), the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of glutamate and ammonia to glutamine, is present at high levels in vertebrate brain tissue and is thought to protect the brain from elevated ammonia concentrations. We tested the hypothesis that high brain GSase activity is critical in preventing accumulation of brain ammonia and glutamate during ammonia loading in the ammonia-intolerant rainbow trout. Trout pre-injected with saline or the GSase inhibitor methionine sulfoximine (MSOX, 6 mg kg–1), were exposed to 0, 670 or 1000 μmol l–1 NH4Cl in the water for 24 and 96 h. Brain ammonia levels were 3- to 6-fold higher in ammonia-exposed fish relative to control fish and MSOX treatment did not alter this. Brain GSase activity was unaffected by ammonia exposure, while MSOX inhibited GSase activity by ∼75%. Brain glutamate levels were lower and glutamine levels were higher in fish exposed to ammonia relative to controls. While MSOX treatment had little impact on brain glutamate, glutamine levels were significantly reduced by 96 h. With ammonia treatment, significant changes in the concentration of multiple other brain amino acids occurred and these changes were mostly reversed or eliminated with MSOX. Overall the changes in amino acid levels suggest that multiple enzymatic pathways can supply glutamate for the production of glutamine via GSase during ammonia exposure and that alternative transaminase pathways can be recruited for ammonia detoxification. Plasma cortisol levels increased 7- to 15-fold at 24 h in response to ammonia and MSOX did not exacerbate this stress response. These findings indicate that rainbow trout possess a relatively large reserve capacity for ammonia detoxification and for preventing glutamate accumulation during hyperammonaemic conditions."},{"title":"Rotational behaviour of encapsulated pond snail embryos in diverse natural environments","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2086","abstract":"Encapsulated freshwater pond snail embryos display a cilia-driven rotation behaviour that is stimulated by artificially induced hypoxia. Previous studies have suggested that the mixing effect of this behaviour causes enhanced oxygen delivery to embryos within their egg capsules. Despite extensive laboratory-based studies describing this behaviour, it is unclear how this behaviour is used to cope with changes in oxygen concentration and other environmental factors in natural water bodies. We made field measurements of embryo rotation rates in laboratory-reared Helisoma trivolvis embryos placed in ponds of different trophic levels that ranged geographically from the southern Alberta prairie to the Rocky Mountains. Abiotic factors including temperature, pH, conductivity and water oxygen concentration were measured to understand how embryonic rotation is influenced by environmental conditions. Results showed that H. trivolvis embryos exhibit differences in rotational behaviour depending on the environmental conditions. Temperature and oxygen concentration were the primary factors significantly affecting rotation rates. The effect of oxygen concentration on rotation rates was not as widespread as observed under laboratory conditions, probably because the measured oxygen concentrations were above the range that influences embryonic rotation in the laboratory. The rotational behaviour of laboratory-reared Lymnaea stagnalis provided confirmation that embryos of other encapsulated pulmonates exhibit a similar rotational response in natural environments. These results suggest that embryo rotation is influenced by a complex interplay of environmental factors."},{"title":"Effects of static magnetic fields on the development and aging of Caenorhabditis elegans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2079","abstract":"The current study investigated the possible effects of static magnetic fields (SMFs) on the developmental and aging processes of Caenorhabditis elegans.

Treatment with a 200 mT SMF reduced the development time from the L2 to the L3 stage by 20%, from L3 to L4 by 23%, and from L4 to young adult by 31%. After SMF treatment, the average lifespan was reduced from 31 days to 24 days for wild-type nematodes. The up-regulation of clk-1, lim-7, daf-2, unc-3 and age-1 after SMF treatment was verified by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Apparently, induction of gene expression is selective and dose dependent. The total developmental time was significantly reduced for the lin-4, lin-14, lin-41 and lim-7 mutants, but not for the let-7, clk-1, unc-3 and age-1 mutants. Lifespan analyses revealed that the let-7, unc-3 and age-1 mutants were not affected by SMF treatment.

Here, we address whether the ubiquitous and versatile form of G-protein regulation in mammals is also found in simpler invertebrate nervous systems. Remarkably, the invertebrate LCav2 channel from the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, does not bear any of the hallmarks of mammalian, voltage-dependent G-protein inhibition of Cav2.2. Swapping either the I-II linker or N-terminus of Cav2.2, which serve as key binding domains for G-protein inhibition, does not endow invertebrate LCav2 channels with voltage-dependent G-protein modulatory capacity. Instead, in vitro expressed LCav2 channels are inhibited slowly by the activation of cAMP, in a manner that depends on G-proteins but does not depend on Gβγ subunits. A similar G-protein and cAMP-dependent inhibition of nifedipine-insensitive LCav2 currents is also consistent in native and identified Lymnaea VD4 neurons. The slower inhibition using a cellular messenger such as cAMP may meet the modulatory needs in invertebrates while an activity-dependent regulation, evolving in vertebrates, provides a more dynamic, fine-tuning of neurosecretion by regulating the influence of neurotransmitter inputs through presynaptic GPCRs."},{"title":"Carotenoid-based coloration, oxidative stress and corticosterone in common lizards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2116","abstract":"Environmental factors including stressors, health status and social context significantly affect carotenoid-based coloration. For instance, stressors may induce the diversion of carotenoids from pigmentation pathways, potentially explaining why stressed animals often exhibit reduced coloration. However, we recently showed that high blood corticosterone concentrations, which are part of the physiological stress response, are associated with increased redness of the belly in the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). This result clearly contrasts with the findings of many studies of carotenoid-based coloration because corticosterone is believed to increase oxidative stress. Here, we examined whether these positive effects are influenced by differences in food availability. We tested the effect of high corticosterone levels on carotenoid-based coloration, antioxidant enzyme activity and oxidative damage in common lizards subject to low and high food availability. Food restriction abolished the carotenoid-based color enhancement when corticosterone concentrations in animals were high. We discuss how carotenoid-based color can honestly signal individual quality in this species and how the increased redness induced by corticosterone could be a terminal investment in an environment where long-term survival prospects are poor but not when immediate survival is endangered."},{"title":"Physiological and immunocytochemical evidence that glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in the activation of arm autotomy in the featherstar Antedon mediterranea (Echinodermata: Crinoidea)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2104","abstract":"The crinoid echinoderm Antedon mediterranea autotomises its arms at specialised skeletal joints known as syzygies that occur at regular intervals along the length of each arm. Detachment is achieved through the nervously mediated destabilisation of ligament fibres at a particular syzygy. The aim of this investigation was to identify neurotransmitters that are involved in the autotomy response. Physiological experiments were conducted on isolated preparations of syzygial joints, which can be induced to undergo autotomy-like fracture by applying stimulatory agents such as elevated [K+]o. Initial experiments with elevated [K+]o showed that the autotomy threshold (the minimum amount of stimulation required to provoke autotomy) is lowest in syzygies at the arm base and rises distally. Of a range of neurotransmitter agonists tested, only l-glutamate invoked syzygial destabilisation, as did its analogues l-aspartate, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and kainate, but not l-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (l-AP4) or N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA). The implication that l-glutamate stimulates syzygial fracture through AMPA/kainate-like receptors was supported by the finding that the action of l-glutamate was inhibited by the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). Acetylcholine depressed the response of syzygial preparations to l-glutamate, suggesting a possible mechanism by which the autotomy threshold could be varied constitutively and facultatively. An immunocytochemical method employing a polyclonal antibody against l-glutamate conjugated to glutaraldehyde revealed l-glutamate-like immunoreactivity in all components of the putative neural pathway controlling the autotomy reflex, including the epidermis, brachial nerve, syzygial nerves and cellular elements close to the syzygial ligaments. We conclude that it is highly probable that l-glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the activation of arm autotomy in A. mediterranea."},{"title":"Effect of two types of stress (heat shock/high temperature and malnutrition/serum deprivation) on porcine ovarian cell functions and their response to hormones","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2125","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to understand the interrelationships between stress, hormones and basic ovarian functions in the ovary. For this purpose, we compared the expression of markers of proliferation (PCNA, cyclin B1), of apoptosis (Bax, caspase-3) and secretory activity (release of progesterone, P4, and insulin-like growth factor, IGF-I) in whole ovarian follicles and granulosa cells cultured in conditions of normal temperature (37.5°C) and feeding (with serum), high temperature (41.5°C, with serum) and malnutrition (37.5°C, without serum), with and without hormones [IGF-I, leptin and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)]. The expression of proliferation and apoptosis markers was evaluated by SDS PAGE–western blotting whereas radioimmunoassay (RIA) measured the release of hormones. High temperature dramatically induced a reduction in both proliferation and apoptosis markers in both ovarian follicles and granulosa cells and induced a significant increase in P4 and IGF-I release by ovarian granulosa cells but not in P4 secretion by ovarian follicles. Serum deprivation increased accumulation of cyclin B1 but not other markers of proliferation (PCNA) and apoptosis (Bax, caspase-3) or P4 release in ovarian follicles. On the contrary, it inhibited the expression of apoptotic marker (Bax), release of both P4 and IGF-I but it did not affect proliferation marker (PCNA) in granulosa cells. Adding IGF-I, leptin and FSH affected proliferation, apoptosis and secretory activity of ovarian cell functions but also prevented an inhibitory effect of high temperature on the expression of Bax and PCNA and an inhibitory action of serum deprivation on PCNA in ovarian follicles. Furthermore, treatment with these hormones prevented an inhibitory action of thermal stress on Bax, PCNA, P4 and IGF-I in ovarian granulosa cells. The present observations (1) confirm the involvement of hormones (IGF-I, leptin and FSH) in the control of proliferation, apoptosis and secretory activity of ovarian cells, (2) demonstrate for the first time that heat stress/increased temperature can induce a reduction in ovarian cell proliferation and apoptosis and an oversecretion of ovarian hormones, (3) show that malnutrition/serum deprivation can reduce both apoptosis and secretory activity of ovarian cells, (4) demonstrate the differences in the response of granulosa and other ovarian follicular cells to stresses, and (5) are the first demonstration that hormones (IGF-I, leptin and FSH) could be used for preventing the effect of stresses on ovarian cell functions."},{"title":"Lizards respond to an extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/1985","abstract":"Animals from a wide range of taxa have been shown to possess magnetic sense and use magnetic compasses to orient; however, there is no information in the literature on whether lizards have either of these abilities. In this study, we investigated the behavioral responses of a diurnal agamid lizard (Pogona vitticeps) to a sinusoidal extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF; 6 and 8 Hz, peak magnetic field 2.6 μT, peak electric field 10 V m−1). Fourteen adult lizards were divided randomly into two groups (the EMF and control groups; each group had three males and four females). The EMF group received whole-body exposure to ELF-EMF and the control group did not. Lizards in the EMF group were exposed to ELF-EMF for 12 h per day (during the light period). The number of tail lifts was monitored beginning 3 days before exposure and ending after 5 days of exposure. For each individual, the average number of tail lifts per day was calculated. The average number of tail lifts per individual per day was greater in the EMF group than in the control group (20.7±6.3 and 9.1±4.5 tail lifts, respectively, N=7 each, P=0.02). We confirmed the reproducibility of this response by a cross-over trial. These results suggest that at least some lizards are able to perceive ELF-EMFs. Furthermore, when the parietal eye of the lizards was covered with a small round aluminum ‘cap’ which could block light, the tail-lifting response to ELF-EMF disappeared. Our experiments suggest that (1) lizards perceive EMFs and (2) the parietal eye may be involved in light-dependent magnetoreceptive responses."},{"title":"Kinematics of flight and the relationship to the vortex wake of a Pallas' long tongued bat (Glossophaga soricina)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2142","abstract":"To obtain a full understanding of the aerodynamics of animal flight, the movement of the wings, the kinematics, needs to be connected to the wake left behind the animal. Here the detailed 3D wingbeat kinematics of bats, Glossophaga soricina, flying in a wind tunnel over a range of flight speeds (1–7 m s−1) was determined from high-speed video. The results were compared with the wake geometry and quantitative wake measurements obtained simultaneously to the kinematics. The wingbeat kinematics varied gradually with flight speed and reflected the changes observed in the wake of the bats. In particular, several of the kinematic parameters reflected the differences in the function of the upstroke at low and high flight speeds. At lower flight speeds the bats use a pitch-up rotation to produce a backward flick which creates thrust and some weight support. At higher speeds this mechanism disappears and the upstroke generates weight support but no thrust. This is reflected by the changes in e.g. angle of attack, span ratio, camber and downstroke ratio. We also determined how different parameters vary throughout a wingbeat over the flight speeds studied. Both the camber and the angle of attack varied over the wingbeat differently at different speeds, suggesting active control of these parameters to adjust to the changing aerodynamic conditions. This study of the kinematics strongly indicates that the flight of bats is governed by an unsteady high-lift mechanism at low flight speeds and points to differences between birds and bats."},{"title":"Directional constraint of endpoint force emerges from hindlimb anatomy","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2131","abstract":"Postural control requires the coordination of force production at the limb endpoints to apply an appropriate force to the body. Subjected to horizontal plane perturbations, quadruped limbs stereotypically produce force constrained along a line that passes near the center of mass. This phenomenon, referred to as the force constraint strategy, may reflect mechanical constraints on the limb or body, a specific neural control strategy or an interaction among neural controls and mechanical constraints. We used a neuromuscular model of the cat hindlimb to test the hypothesis that the anatomical constraints restrict the mechanical action of individual muscles during stance and constrain the response to perturbations to a line independent of perturbation direction. In a linearized neuromuscular model of the cat hindlimb, muscle lengthening directions were highly conserved across 10,000 different muscle activation patterns, each of which produced an identical, stance-like endpoint force. These lengthening directions were closely aligned with the sagittal plane and reveal an anatomical structure for directionally constrained force responses. Each of the 10,000 activation patterns was predicted to produce stable stance based on Lyapunov stability analysis. In forward simulations of the nonlinear, seven degree of freedom model under the action of 200 random muscle activation patterns, displacement of the endpoint from its equilibrium position produced restoring forces, which were also biased toward the sagittal plane. The single exception was an activation pattern based on minimum muscle stress optimization, which produced destabilizing force responses in some perturbation directions. The sagittal force constraint increased during simulations as the system shifted from an inertial response during the acceleration phase to a viscoelastic response as peak velocity was obtained. These results qualitatively match similar experimental observations and suggest that the force constraint phenomenon may result from the anatomical arrangement of the limb."},{"title":"Evidence for within-individual energy reallocation in cold-challenged, egg-producing birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/1991","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that the metabolic cost of avian egg production involves a 16–27% increase in metabolic rate (MR) above non-reproductive basal or resting values (BMR and RMR, respectively). To determine how the metabolic cost of egg production interacted with the costs of other essential processes (such as cold acclimation and active heat production), we measured the MR of non-breeding and egg-producing zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) while (a) warm-acclimated (to 19–21°C) and measured within their thermoneutral zone (at 35°C), (b) cold-acclimated (to 7°C) and measured at thermoneutrality (at 35°C, i.e. not actively producing heat), and (c) cold-acclimated and measured below thermoneutrality (at 7°C) (i.e. during active heat production). The metabolic cost of egg production was small (24% above BMR) compared with the additive costs of cold acclimation and active heat production (224% above BMR). Exposure to low ambient temperatures was accompanied by an increase in seed consumption (by 72%) and a decrease in locomotor activity (by 72%) compared with warm-acclimated, non-breeding values. By contrast, egg production in heat-producing females was associated with an 11% decrease in MR and a 22% decrease in seed consumption compared with non-breeding thermoregulating values. Our data suggest that while the increase in MR associated with egg production is small in relation to the birds' capacity to increase MR in response to other energetically demanding processes, the addition of egg production to these metabolically costly activities may be enough to necessitate the use of energy-saving strategies, such as internal energy reallocation, to cope with the additional energetic demands."},{"title":"Feasting, fasting and freezing: energetic effects of meal size and temperature on torpor expression by little brown bats Myotis lucifugus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2165","abstract":"Torpor is an adaptation for energy conservation employed by many species of small-bodied endotherms. However, surprisingly little is known regarding proximate factors influencing day-to-day variation in torpor expression in the wild. We used open-flow respirometry to quantify torpor expression in nine little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus, LeConte 1831) at two ambient temperatures (7°C and 17°C) following either sham feeding or consumption of a high-protein meal (50% or 100% of the mass required to reach satiation for each individual). Food consumption significantly increased the time spent normothermic before torpor entry but did not affect either the rate of body cooling or torpid metabolic rate. Bats did not fully exploit potential energy savings by maximising their use of torpor. Instead they varied torpor expression such that total energy expenditure over the course of each 22-h trial was balanced against gross energy intake immediately before the trial, independent of ambient temperature. This was accomplished by adjusting the timing of entry into torpor (thus altering the time spent torpid), rather than by modulating torpid metabolic rate. However, pre-trial body mass was also a significant predictor of torpor expression, which suggests that energy reserves combine with recent foraging success to influence individuals' decisions about depth and duration of their torpor bouts. We also present evidence that little brown bats use the heat generated through digestion (i.e. the heat increment of feeding) to substitute for active thermogenesis at sub-thermoneutral temperatures, thereby reducing the energetic costs of thermoregulation prior to torpor entry."},{"title":"Aquatic feeding in pipid frogs: the use of suction for prey capture","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2001","abstract":"Inertial suction feeding is the most common method of prey capture among aquatic vertebrates. However, it had been unclear whether the aquatic frogs in the family Pipidae also used inertial suction for prey capture. In this study, we examined feeding behavior in four species of pipids, Pipa pipa, Xenopus laevis, Hymenochirus boettgeri and Pseudhymenochirus merlini. Pressure in the buccopharyngeal cavity was measured during prey capture. These pressure measurements were coupled with high-speed recordings of feeding behavior. For each species, the internal buccopharyngeal pressure was found to drop significantly below ambient pressure, and changes in pressure corresponded with the onset of mouth opening. Kinematic analysis revealed that all species of pipids generated subambient pressure during prey capture; H. boettgeri and P. merlini relied solely on inertial suction feeding. Pipa pipa and X. laevis additionally employed forelimb scooping during prey capture but both of these species demonstrated the ability to capture prey with inertial suction alone. Based on buccopharyngeal pressure measurements as well as kinematic analyses, we conclude that inertial suction feeding is used during prey capture in these four species of pipids."},{"title":"Osmoregulation in the Antarctic nematode Panagrolaimus davidi","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2025","abstract":"A technique for determining the internal osmotic concentration of a small nematode using a modified nanolitre osmometer is described and used to investigate osmoregulation in the Antarctic nematode Panagrolaimus davidi.

The pattern of melting in the nematode's different body compartments suggests that it is the osmolality of its pseudocoelomic fluid that is being measured.

In the laboratory during the winter hibernation period, many hibernators enter a series of multi-day torpor bouts, dropping their body temperature to near ambient, and cease to feed even if food is present in their cage. The mechanism(s) that regulates food intake in hibernators is unclear. Recently, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to play a key role in the central regulation of food intake in mammals. We hypothesized that infusing an AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1 B-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), intracerebroventricularly (ICV) into the third ventricle of the hypothalamus would stimulate yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) to feed during their hibernation season. Infusion of AICAR ICV into marmots at an ambient temperature of 22°C caused a significant (P<0.05) increase in food intake. In addition, animals stimulated to feed did not enter torpor during the infusion period. Marmots ICV infused with saline did not increase food intake and these animals continued to undergo torpor at an ambient temperature of 22°C. Our results suggest that AICAR stimulated the food intake pathway, presumably by activating AMPK. These results support the hypothesis that AMPK may be involved in regulating food intake in hibernators and that there may be common neural pathways involved in regulating feeding and eliciting torpor."},{"title":"Hydrodynamic fin function of brief squid, Lolliguncula brevis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2009","abstract":"Although the pulsed jet is often considered the foundation of a squid's locomotive system, the lateral fins also probably play an important role in swimming, potentially providing thrust, lift and dynamic stability as needed. Fin morphology and movement vary greatly among squid species, but the locomotive role of the fins is not well understood. To begin to elucidate the locomotive role of the fins in squids, fin hydrodynamics were studied in the brief squid Lolliguncula brevis, a species that exhibits a wide range of fin movements depending on swimming speed. Individual squid were trained to swim in both the arms-first and tail-first orientations against currents in a water tunnel seeded with light-reflective particles. Particle-laden water around the fins was illuminated with lasers and videotaped so that flow dynamics around the fins could be analyzed using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). Time-averaged forces generated by the fin were quantified from vorticity fields of the fin wake. During the low swimming speeds considered in this study [<2.5 dorsal mantle lengths (DML) per second], L. brevis exhibited four unique fin wake patterns, each with distinctive vortical structures: (1) fin mode I, in which one vortex is shed with each downstroke, generally occurring at low speeds; (2) fin mode II, an undulatory mode in which a continuous linked chain of vortices is produced; (3) fin mode III, in which one vortex is shed with each downstroke and upstroke, and; (4) fin mode IV, in which a discontinuous chain of linked double vortex structures is produced. All modes were detected during tail-first swimming but only fin modes II and III were observed during arms-first swimming. The fins produced horizontal and vertical forces of varying degrees depending on stroke phase, swimming speed, and swimming orientation. During tail-first swimming, the fins functioned primarily as stabilizers at low speeds before shifting to propulsors as speed increased, all while generating net lift. During arms-first swimming, the fins primarily provided lift with thrust production playing a reduced role. These results demonstrate the lateral fins are an integral component of the complex locomotive system of L. brevis, producing lift and thrust forces through different locomotive modes."},{"title":"Numerical simulation of a pectoral fin during labriform swimming","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2038","abstract":"We numerically examine the fluid–structure interaction and force generation of a skeleton-reinforced fin that geometrically, structurally and kinematically resembles the pectoral fin of a fish during labriform swimming. This fin contains a soft membrane with negligible bending stiffness and 12 embedded rays (modeled as beams). A potential flow-based boundary element model is applied to solve the fluid flow around the fin, in which the vorticity field is modeled as thin vorticity sheets shed from prescribed locations (the sharp trailing edge). The fin motion is actuated by dorsoventral and anteroposterior rotations of the rays (the motion of each ray is controlled individually), as well as pitching motion of the baseline. Consequently, the fin undergoes a combination of flapping (lift-based) and rowing (drag-based) motions typical in labriform swimming. The fin motion contains two strokes: a recovery stroke and a power stroke. The performance of the fin depends upon kinematic parameters such as the Strouhal number, the phase lag between rays, the pitching motion of the baseline and the passive deformations of the rays. The most interesting finding is that the strengthening of the ray at the leading edge plays a pivotal role in performance enhancement by reducing the effective angle of attack and decreasing the power expenditure during the recovery stroke."},{"title":"A sky polarization compass in lizards: the central role of the parietal eye","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2048","abstract":"The present study first examined whether ruin lizards Podarcis sicula are able to orientate using the e-vector direction of polarized light. Ruin lizards were trained and tested indoors, inside a hexagonal Morris water maze, positioned under an artificial light source producing plane polarized light with a single e-vector, which provided an axial cue. Lizards were subjected to axial training by positioning two identical goals in contact with the centre of two opposite side walls of the Morris water maze. Goals were invisible because they were placed just beneath the water surface, and water was rendered opaque. The results showed that the directional choices of lizards meeting learning criteria were bimodally distributed along the training axis, and that after 90 deg rotation of the e-vector direction of polarized light the lizards directional choices rotated correspondingly, producing a bimodal distribution which was perpendicular to the training axis. The present results confirm in ruin lizards results previously obtained in other lizard species showing that these reptiles can use the e-vector direction of polarized light in the form of a sky polarization compass. The second step of the study aimed at answering the still open question of whether functioning of a sky polarization compass would be mediated by the lizard parietal eye. To test this, ruin lizards meeting learning criteria were tested inside the Morris water maze under polarized light after their parietal eyes were painted black. Lizards with black-painted parietal eyes were completely disoriented. Thus, the present data show for the first time that the parietal eye plays a central role in mediating the functioning of a putative sky polarization compass of lizards."},{"title":"Methamphetamine enhances memory of operantly conditioned respiratory behavior in the snail Lymnaea stagnalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2055","abstract":"Amphetamines have been used as cognitive enhancers to promote learning and memory. Amphetamines are also drugs of abuse that may promote the initiation of strong memories that ultimately lead to addiction. To understand how methamphetamine (Meth) may be augmenting learning and memory, we chose a relatively simple system, the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. We studied the effects of Meth exposure on the long-term memory (LTM), extinction and reinstatement of operantly conditioned aerial respiratory behavior in Lymnaea. We first determined doses of Meth that would acutely alter respiratory behavior. Next, we measured the impact of training snails in Meth solution or water (control group) using a training procedure that produces LTM (>6 h) in control conditions. Meth exposure impaired the expression of LTM 21 h after two training sessions, but this appeared to be a context-dependent effect only. However, snails exposed to 3.3 μmol l−1 Meth during training had a decreased rate of extinction of the operantly conditioned memory. We then tested whether this decreased ability of snails to extinguish memory was due to enhanced LTM or impaired extinction of that memory. Snails were operantly conditioned in water and exposed to Meth 16 h after their last trial but 4–5 h prior to extinction. Meth produced an increase rather than a decrease in extinction rate. Thus, Meth impaired extinction only when snails were exposed to Meth during training. Last, we tested the effect of Meth on the ability to form LTM using a single training procedure that is suboptimal for LTM formation. Control snails did not demonstrate LTM, as expected, but pre-exposure of snails to 3.3 μmol l−1 Meth 24 h prior to the single training session produced LTM 24 h later, indicating that Meth pre-exposure primed snails for LTM formation. Taken together, our studies suggest that LTM is strengthened by Meth such that extinction training is less effective. Lymnaea provides a simple and useful model system to dissect the cellular and/or molecular mechanisms of how Meth may initiate the formation of stronger memories."},{"title":"Income breeding and temperature-induced plasticity in reproductive traits in lizards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2073","abstract":"We used the northern grass lizard Takydromus septentrionalis as a model animal to examine the energy allocation strategy and whether body temperature can affect maternal reproductive traits in lizards. We maintained adult females collected from the field soon after winter dormancy under three thermal conditions (24.0±1.0°C, 28.0±1.0°C and 32.0±1.0°C) throughout the subsequent reproductive season, and then recorded their energy intake, digestive efficiency, body size and mass changes, and reproductive parameters. Manipulation of body temperature in reproducing females affected energy intake and several maternal reproductive characteristics. Females allocated energy to reproduction following the fulfillment of energetic requirements for metabolism and growth. The reduced energy availability for reproduction constrained females at low or high body temperatures to produce fewer and smaller eggs per season but had no role in influencing the number of eggs produced in single reproductive bouts. Females used currently acquired energy to fuel reproduction, and this strategy did not shift seasonally from the first to subsequent clutches. Our study supports the idea that the use of currently acquired energy for reproduction may be more widespread in ectotherms than thought before, and shows for the first time that egg size is thermally plastic in T. septentrionalis, where eggs produced in single reproductive bouts are believed to be well optimized for size."},{"title":"Effect of anomalous pulse timing on call discrimination by females of the gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor): behavioral correlates of neurobiology","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/12/2066","abstract":"Research has demonstrated that certain midbrain neurons of anurans ‘count’ interpulse intervals (IPIs). Some neurons fire after exposure to fewer intervals than do others. Counting can be reset to zero if an IPI falls outside the cell's tolerance range. We tested female gray treefrogs for behavioral correlates of these neural response patterns using phonotaxis tests in order to gain a better understanding of the mechanistic bases of female responses to calls. For example, previous work demonstrated females often prefer longer to shorter pulsed advertisement calls, even when the former occur at lower rates. Call attractiveness can also be reduced when pulse duration and timing have been manipulated experimentally or disrupted by acoustic interference. In this study, female responses were consistent with neural data, emphasizing the importance of IPIs. Females discriminated in favor of calls with normal interpulse timing relative to those in which a single IPI was too long or too short. Our data suggest that neural resetting of interval counting by inappropriate intervals may more strongly influence females than reduced firing in response to such intervals on an individual basis. Data also suggest a transition point between 125 ms and 175 ms at which an interval between pulse strings is treated as an interval between calls."},{"title":"Predicting bite force in mammals: two-dimensional versus three-dimensional lever models","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1844","abstract":"Bite force is a measure of whole-organism performance that is often used to investigate the relationships between performance, morphology and fitness. When in vivo measurements of bite force are unavailable, researchers often turn to lever models to predict bite forces. This study demonstrates that bite force predictions based on two-dimensional (2-D) lever models can be improved by including three-dimensional (3-D) geometry and realistic physiological cross-sectional areas derived from dissections. Widely used, the 2-D method does a reasonable job of predicting bite force. However, it does so by over predicting physiological cross-sectional areas for the masseter and pterygoid muscles and under predicting physiological cross-sectional areas for the temporalis muscle. We found that lever models that include the three dimensional structure of the skull and mandible and physiological cross-sectional areas calculated from dissected muscles provide the best predictions of bite force. Models that accurately represent the biting mechanics strengthen our understanding of which variables are functionally relevant and how they are relevant to feeding performance."},{"title":"Orientation and autumn migration routes of juvenile sharp-tailed sandpipers at a staging site in Alaska","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1829","abstract":"Arctic waders are well known for their impressive long-distance migrations between their high northerly breeding grounds and wintering areas in the Southern hemisphere. Performing such long migrations requires precise orientation mechanisms. We conducted orientation cage experiments with juvenile sharp-tailed sandpipers (Calidris acuminata) to investigate what cues they rely on when departing from Alaska on their long autumn migration flights across the Pacific Ocean to Australasia, and which possible migration routes they could use. Experiments were performed under natural clear skies, total overcast conditions and in manipulated magnetic fields at a staging site in Alaska. Under clear skies the juvenile sharp-tailed sandpipers oriented towards SSE, which coincides well with reported sun compass directions from their breeding grounds in Siberia towards Alaska and could reflect their true migratory direction towards Australasia assuming that they change direction towards SW somewhere along the route. Under overcast skies the sandpipers showed a mean direction towards SW which would lead them to Australasia, if they followed a sun compass route. However, because of unfavourable weather conditions (headwinds) associated with overcast conditions, these south-westerly directions could also reflect local movements. The juvenile sharp-tailed sandpipers responded clearly to the manipulated magnetic field under overcast skies, suggesting the use of a magnetic compass for selecting their courses."},{"title":"A model of visual–olfactory integration for odour localisation in free-flying fruit flies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1886","abstract":"Flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) locate a concealed appetitive odour source most accurately in environments containing vertical visual contrasts. To investigate how visuomotor and olfactory responses may be integrated, we examine the free-flight behaviour of flies in three visual conditions, with and without food odour present. While odour localisation is facilitated by uniformly distributed vertical contrast as compared with purely horizontal contrast, localised vertical contrast also facilitates odour localisation, but only if the odour source is situated close to it. We implement a model of visuomotor control consisting of three parallel subsystems: an optomotor response stabilising the model fly's yaw orientation; a collision avoidance system to saccade away from looming obstacles; and a speed regulation system. This model reproduces many of the behaviours we observe in flies, including visually mediated ‘rebound’ turns following saccades. Using recordings of real odour plumes, we simulate the presence of an odorant in the arena, and investigate ways in which the olfactory input could modulate visuomotor control. We reproduce the experimental results by using the change in odour intensity to regulate the sensitivity of collision avoidance, resulting in visually mediated chemokinesis. Additionally, it is necessary to amplify the optomotor response whenever odour is present, increasing the model fly's tendency to steer towards features of the visual environment. We conclude that visual and olfactory responses of Drosophila are not independent, but that relatively simple interaction between these modalities can account for the observed visual dependence of odour source localisation."},{"title":"Myoglobin production in emperor penguins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1901","abstract":"Increased oxygen storage is essential to the diving capacities of marine mammals and seabirds.

Mean Mb concentration in 5.9 month old juveniles was 2.7±0.4 g 100 g−1 muscle (44% that of wild adults), and in adults that had been captive all their lives it was 3.7±0.1 g 100 g−1 muscle. The Mb and Mb mRNA data are consistent with regulation of Mb production at the level of transcription as in other animals. Significant Mb and Mb mRNA production occurred in chicks and young juveniles even without any diving activity. The further increase in adult Mb concentrations appears to require the exercise/hypoxia of diving because Mb concentration in captive, non-diving adults only reached 60% of that of wild adults. The much greater relative increase in Mb concentration than in Mb mRNA content between young chicks and adults suggests that there is not a simple 1:1 relationship between Mb mRNA content and Mb concentration. Nutritional limitation in young chicks and post-transcriptional regulation of Mb concentration may also be involved."},{"title":"Sustained performance by red and white muscle fibres from the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1921","abstract":"The mechanical performance of red and white muscle fibres from dogfish was compared during a long series of contractions with sinusoidal movement or under isometric conditions at 12°C (normal in vivo temperature). Power output was measured during sinusoidal movement at 0.75 Hz and peak-to-peak amplitude about 12% L0. Tetanus duty cycle was 33% (0.44 s) at phase −8% (first stimulus at 0.107 s before shortening started). Initially, the red fibres produced only about one third as much power as the white fibres, 6.57±0.63 W kg−1 wet mass (mean ± s.e.m.) and 18.3±2.3, respectively. Red fibres were better at sustaining power output; it declined rapidly to about 60% of its initial value and then remained relatively steady for up to 450 cycles of movement. Force during shortening declined, but force during stretch did not increase: force always relaxed to a low value before stretch started. By contrast, net power output by white fibres declined rapidly to zero within about 50 cycles. Two changes contributed: decline in force during shortening and an increase in force during stretch because relaxation became progressively less complete during the series of contractions. In isometric series (0.44 s stimulation every 1.33 s, cycle frequency 0.75 Hz), red and white fibres sustained peak isometric force similarly; in the 50th cycle force was 59±3% and 56±4% of initial values. The time required for force to relax to 10% of its maximum value decreased during the series for red fibres and increased for white fibres."},{"title":"Insects running on elastic surfaces","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1907","abstract":"In nature, cockroaches run rapidly over complex terrain such as leaf litter. These substrates are rarely rigid, and are frequently very compliant. Whether and how compliant surfaces change the dynamics of rapid insect locomotion has not been investigated to date largely due to experimental limitations. We tested the hypothesis that a running insect can maintain average forward speed over an extremely soft elastic surface (10 N m−1) equal to 2/3 of its virtual leg stiffness (15 N m−1). Cockroaches Blaberus discoidalis were able to maintain forward speed (mean ± s.e.m., 37.2±0.6 cm s−1 rigid surface versus 38.0±0.7 cm s−1 elastic surface; repeated-measures ANOVA, P=0.45). Step frequency was unchanged (24.5±0.6 steps s−1 rigid surface versus 24.7±0.4 steps s−1 elastic surface; P=0.54). To uncover the mechanism, we measured the animal's centre of mass (COM) dynamics using a novel accelerometer backpack, attached very near the COM. Vertical acceleration of the COM on the elastic surface had a smaller peak-to-peak amplitude (11.50±0.33 m s−2, rigid versus 7.7±0.14 m s−2, elastic; P=0.04). The observed change in COM acceleration over an elastic surface required no change in effective stiffness when duty factor and ground stiffness were taken into account. Lowering of the COM towards the elastic surface caused the swing legs to land earlier, increasing the period of double support. A feedforward control model was consistent with the experimental results and provided one plausible, simple explanation of the mechanism."},{"title":"The importance of leading edge vortices under simplified flapping flight conditions at the size scale of birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1930","abstract":"Over the last decade, interest in animal flight has grown, in part due to the possible use of flapping propulsion for micro air vehicles. The importance of unsteady lift-enhancing mechanisms in insect flight has been recognized, but unsteady effects were generally thought to be absent for the flapping flight of larger animals. Only recently has the existence of LEVs (leading edge vortices) in small vertebrates such as swifts, small bats and hummingbirds been confirmed. To study the relevance of unsteady effects at the scale of large birds [reduced frequency k between 0.05 and 0.3, k=(πfc)/U∞; f is wingbeat frequency, U∞ is free-stream velocity, and c is the average wing chord], and the consequences of the lack of kinematic and morphological refinements, we have designed a simplified goose-sized flapping model for wind tunnel testing. The 2-D flow patterns along the wing span were quantitatively visualized using particle image velocimetry (PIV), and a three-component balance was used to measure the forces generated by the wings. The flow visualization on the wing showed the appearance of LEVs, which is typically associated with a delayed stall effect, and the transition into flow separation. Also, the influence of the delayed stall and flow separation was clearly visible in measurements of instantaneous net force over the wingbeat cycle. Here, we show that, even at reduced frequencies as low as those of large bird flight, unsteady effects are present and non-negligible and have to be addressed by kinematic and morphological adaptations."},{"title":"Echolocation in sympatric Peale's dolphins (Lagenorhynchus australis) and Commerson's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) producing narrow-band high-frequency clicks","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1940","abstract":"An increasing number of smaller odontocetes have recently been shown to produce stereotyped narrow-band high-frequency (NBHF) echolocation clicks. Click source parameters of NBHF clicks are very similar, and it is unclear whether the sonars of individual NBHF species are adapted to specific habitats or the presence of other NBHF species. Here, we test whether sympatric NBHF species sharing the same habitat show similar adaptations in their echolocation clicks and whether their clicks display signs of character displacement. Wide-band sound recordings were obtained with a six-element hydrophone array from wild Peale's (Lagenorhynchus australis) and Commerson's (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) dolphins off the Falkland Islands. The centroid frequency was different between Commerson's (133±2 kHz) and Peale's (129±3 kHz) dolphins. The r.m.s. bandwidth was 12±3 kHz for both species. The source level was higher for Peale's dolphin (185±6 dB re 1 μPa p.–p.) than for Commerson's (177±5 dB re 1 μPa p.–p.). The mean directivity indexes were 25 dB for both species. The relatively low source levels in combination with the high directivity index may be an adaptation to reduce clutter when foraging in a coastal environment. We conclude that the small species-specific shifts in distribution of centroid frequencies around 130 kHz may reflect character displacement in otherwise-stereotyped NBHF clicks."},{"title":"Evidence that water exudes when holothurian connective tissue stiffens","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1960","abstract":"The dermis of the body wall of sea cucumbers is composed mainly of extracellular materials such as collagens, proteoglycans and water; the water content is as high as 80%. Yet it shows rapid changes in stiffness under neural control. The dermis has been proposed to assume three mechanical states, soft, standard, and stiff. We investigated the relationship between the stiffness and the dermal mass and volume. Both the mass and volume decreased by 15% when the dermis stiffened from the standard state to the stiff state by mechanical stimulation and by chemical stimulation with potassium-rich seawater. The effect of the latter was abolished by anesthesia. The mass decrease was caused largely by water exudation. Tensilin, a holothurian protein that stiffens the soft dermis to form the standard state, did not cause any changes in mass. These results suggested that the stiffening mechanisms responsible for the transition from the soft state to the standard state, and that from the standard to the stiff state, are different. The removal of water from the dermis in the standard state, by soaking in hypertonic solution, caused only slight stiffening, which suggested that water exudation was not the direct cause of the stiffening. A change of pH of the surrounding medium, either more acidic or basic, was not associated with mass changes, although it caused a large increase in stiffness. The implications of the present results for the molecular mechanisms of the stiffness changes are discussed."},{"title":"Underwater attachment in current: the role of setose attachment structures on the gills of the mayfly larvae Epeorus assimilis (Ephemeroptera, Heptageniidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1950","abstract":"Setose pads of aquatic Epeorus assimilis larvae are specialised structures located ventrally on the part of the gill lamella contacting the substrate and were suggested to have an attachment function in strong currents. In order to test the role of these setose pads in underwater attachment for the first time, we measured friction (shear) forces generated by the gill lamellae on solid substrates. Moreover, the influence of a different kind of surface roughness on attachment was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy showed that four different seta types can be found on the pads. Our results revealed that the pads significantly contributed to friction force generated on smooth and on some rough substrates but not on certain surfaces of intermediate roughness. The contribution of pads to the friction coefficient in experiments was lower than expected under natural conditions, which may be caused by a smaller contact area between the pads and the substrate (changes in material properties, lack of the active control of body positioning of the larva). The friction coefficient of the gill lamellae with the substrate depended on the surface roughness of the substrate and on the pulling direction. These results suggest that interlocking between structures of the insect cuticle and substrate irregularities, as well as molecular adhesion, contribute to friction."},{"title":"Sea ice protects the embryos of the Antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri from oxidative damage due to naturally enhanced levels of UV-B radiation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1967","abstract":"The ‘ozone hole’ has caused an increase in ultraviolet B radiation (UV-B, 280–320 nm) penetrating Antarctic coastal marine ecosystems, however the direct effect of this enhanced UV-B on pelagic organisms remains unclear. Oxidative stress, the in vivo production of reactive oxygen species to levels high enough to overcome anti-oxidant defences, is a key outcome of exposure to solar radiation, yet to date few studies have examined this physiological response in Antarctic marine species in situ or in direct relation to the ozone hole. To assess the biological effects of UV-B, in situ experiments were conducted at Cape Armitage in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica (77.06°S, 164.42°E) on the common Antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri Meissner (Echinoidea) over two consecutive 4-day periods in the spring of 2008 (26–30 October and 1–5 November). The presence of the ozone hole, and a corresponding increase in UV-B exposure, resulted in unequivocal increases in oxidative damage to lipids and proteins, and developmental abnormality in embryos of S. neumayeri growing in open waters. Results also indicate that embryos have only a limited capacity to increase the activities of protective antioxidant enzymes, but not to levels sufficient to prevent severe oxidative damage from occurring. Importantly, results show that the effect of the ozone hole is largely mitigated by sea ice coverage. The present findings suggest that the coincidence of reduced stratospheric ozone and a reduction in sea ice coverage may produce a situation in which significant damage to Antarctic marine ecosystems may occur."},{"title":"Discordancy or template-based recognition? Dissecting the cognitive basis of the rejection of foreign eggs in hosts of avian brood parasites","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1976","abstract":"Many avian hosts have evolved antiparasite defence mechanisms, including egg rejection, to reduce the costs of brood parasitism. The two main alternative cognitive mechanisms of egg discrimination are thought to be based on the perceived discordancy of eggs in a clutch or the use of recognition templates by hosts. Our experiments reveal that the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), a host of the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), relies on both mechanisms. In support of the discordancy mechanism, hosts rejected their own eggs (13%) and manipulated (‘parasitic’) eggs (27%) above control levels in experiments when manipulated eggs were in the majority but when clutches also included a minority of own eggs. Hosts that had the chance to observe the manipulated eggs daily just after laying did not show stronger rejection of manipulated eggs than when the eggs were manipulated at clutch completion. When clutches contained only manipulated eggs, in 33% of the nests hosts showed rejection, also supporting a mechanism of template-based egg discrimination. Rejection using a recognition template might be more advantageous because discordancy-based egg discrimination is increasingly error prone with higher rates of multiple parasitism."},{"title":"Quantity discrimination in salamanders","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1822","abstract":"We investigated discrimination of large quantities in salamanders of the genus Plethodon. Animals were challenged with two different quantities (8 vs 12 or 8 vs 16) in a two-alternative choice task. Stimuli were live crickets, videos of live crickets or images animated by a computer program. Salamanders reliably chose the larger of two quantities when the ratio between the sets was 1:2 and stimuli were live crickets or videos thereof. Magnitude discrimination was not successful when the ratio was 2:3, or when the ratio was 1:2 when stimuli were computer animated. Analysis of the salamanders' success and failure as well as analysis of stimulus features points towards movement as a dominant feature for quantity discrimination. The results are generally consistent with large quantity discrimination investigated in many other animals (e.g. primates, fish), current models of quantity representation (analogue magnitudes) and data on sensory aspects of amphibian prey-catching behaviour (neuronal motion processing)."},{"title":"Oral and integumental uptake of free exogenous glycine by the Japanese spiny lobster Panulirus japonicus phyllosoma larvae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1859","abstract":"The possibility of direct integumental absorption of the amino acid glycine from a solution in seawater was investigated in 250–260 day old (16.9–50.0 mg wet mass) phyllosoma larvae of the Japanese spiny lobster Panulirus japonicus Von Siebold 1824. The uptake of the amino acid was assessed by autoradiography and liquid scintillation counting (LSC) of larvae incubated with [2-3H]glycine and the net uptake was estimated by a time course high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the concentration of glycine in the incubation medium. Autoradiography revealed the presence of labelled glycine in the cuticle, epidermis and internal tissues (digestive system, muscle, haemocytes) within 30 min of the onset of incubation. Absorption through the integument was confirmed by autoradiography and LSC as glycine uptake was observed even in larvae whose mouths were artificially sealed with cyanoacrylate bond prior to incubation. Scanning electron microscopic examination of the body surface revealed no bacterial population that could have mediated the uptake. HPLC revealed a consistent net uptake (0.29–0.39 μmol g−1 body mass h−1) of glycine in larvae incubated in 6 μmol l−1 glycine and high individual variation (e.g. absorption or release) in larvae incubated at higher concentrations (30 and 60 μmol l−1). Thus, the results of this study provide clear confirmation that, in addition to the known mode of oral feeding on macroscopic food masses, P. japonicus phyllosoma larvae are also able to absorb nutrients directly from the surrounding medium."},{"title":"Target tracking during venom ‘spitting’ by cobras","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1797","abstract":"Spitting cobras, which defend themselves by streaming venom towards the face and/or eyes of a predator, must be highly accurate because the venom they spit is only an effective deterrent if it lands on the predator's cornea. Several factors make this level of accuracy difficult to achieve; the target is moving, is frequently >1 m away from the snake and the venom stream is released in approximately 50 ms. In the present study we show that spitting cobras can accurately track the movements of a potentially threatening vertebrate, and by anticipating its subsequent (short-term) movements direct their venom to maximize the likelihood of striking the target's eye. Unlike other animals that project material, in spitting cobras the discharge orifice (the fang) is relatively fixed so directing the venom stream requires rapid movements of the entire head. The cobra's ability to track and anticipate the target's movement, and to perform rapid cephalic oscillations that coordinate with the target's movements suggest a level of neural processing that has not been attributed to snakes, or other reptiles, previously."},{"title":"Effect of slow desiccation and freezing on gene transcription and stress survival of an Antarctic nematode","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1803","abstract":"Nematodes are the dominant soil animals of the Antarctic Dry Valleys and are capable of surviving desiccation and freezing in an anhydrobiotic state. Genes induced by desiccation stress have been successfully enumerated in nematodes; however, little is known about gene regulation by Antarctic nematodes that can survive multiple types and incidences of environmental stress. In order to reveal the molecular response of anhydrobiotic survival, we investigated the genetic response of an Antarctic nematode, Plectus murrayi, which can survive desiccation and freezing. Using molecular approaches, we provide insight into the regulation of desiccation-induced transcripts during different stages of stress survival under conditions characteristic of the Antarctic Dry Valley environment. Our study revealed that exposure to slow desiccation and freezing plays an important role in the transcription of stress, metabolism and signal transduction-related genes and improves desiccation and freezing survival compared with nematodes exposed to fast desiccation and freezing. Temporal analyses of gene expression showed that pre-exposure to mild stress promotes survival of harsher stress. Our results further show that exposure to slow dehydration not only improves extreme desiccation survival but also promotes enhanced cold tolerance. We also provide evidence that slow dehydration can enhance freeze tolerance in an Antarctic nematode. Expression profiling of P. murrayi transcripts is an important step in understanding the genome-level response of this nematode to different environmental stressors."},{"title":"Indirect closing of the elytra in a cockchafer, Melolontha hippocastani F.

We investigated closing (1) by loading or arrest of some thoracic segments in a tethered flying beetle, (2) by animation, i.e. passive motion of preparations of the thorax simulating the action of some muscle, and (3) by excision of some parts of sclerites or cuts across certain muscles. We found out that depression of the prothorax, necessary to unlock the elytra, precedes their opening but elevation of the prothorax is synchronous with the closing. The closing is retarded if the elevation is retarded by loading; if the elevating prothorax is clamped, then the closing is also arrested or hindered; animation of the elevation of the prothorax in the dead animal is enough for the closing of the previously spread elytra; the closing is prevented if a piece at the hind edge of the pronotum, positioned in front of the root of an elytron, is excised. This excision also prevents closing in the in vivo experiments. Mechanical interaction between the elytron and the prothorax is limited to the contact point between the posterior edge of the pronotum and the lateral apophysis of the root. Thus, the elevation of the prothorax is the indirect and main mechanism of the closing in Melolontha."},{"title":"Homeostasis of glucose in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum): the role of serotonin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1813","abstract":"In this study, we evaluated, for the first time, the 5-HT (serotonin)-mediated control of glucose homeostasis in the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Intraperitoneal administration of 5-HT increased plasma levels of glucose, adrenaline and noradrenaline. By contrast, intracerebroventricular administration of 5-HT did not cause any significant variation in plasma levels of glucose. The release of endogenous 5-HT following intraperitoneal administration of d-fenfluramine led to a significant increase in plasma levels of glucose and adrenaline. Intraperitoneal administration of (1) MIAN (a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist) did not block either the hyperglycaemic action or the increase in plasma levels of adrenaline induced by 5-HT, but did block the increase in plasma levels of noradrenaline, and (2) 5-CT (a 5-HT1 agonist) increased the plasma levels of glucose and of adrenaline, without altering those of noradrenaline. Administration of TFMPP (a 5-HT1B agonist) did not increase the plasma levels of glucose, and the hyperglycaemic action of 5-HT was not blocked by antagonists of 5-HT1A (WAY 100635), 5-HT1D (BRL 15572), 5-HT2B (SB 204741) or 5-HT7 (pimozide) receptors. It was demonstrated that, in rainbow trout, peripheral 5-HT, but not brain 5-HT intervenes in the modulation of glucose homeostasis with a hyperglycaemic effect. This effect is associated with the release of adrenaline and activation of 5-HT1-like receptors. As far as could be determined in the present study, these 5-HT1-like receptors are unrelated to either the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B or 5-HT1D receptor subtypes of mammals. The 5-HT2-type receptors may mediate the release of noradrenaline, but not of adrenaline, and furthermore, do not appear to play an important role in the hyperglycaemic effect exerted by 5-HT."},{"title":"Functional physiology of lantern shark (Etmopterus spinax) luminescent pattern: differential hormonal regulation of luminous zones","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1852","abstract":"Lantern sharks are small deep-sea sharks that harbour complex species-specific luminescent photophore patterns. The luminescent pattern of one of these sharks, Etmopterus spinax, is made up of nine luminous zones. Previous experiments revealed that in the largest of these zones (ventral zone), photophores are under hormonal control, light being triggered by both melatonin (MT) and prolactin (PRL). In this study, we analysed the luminescent responses to MT and PRL in five other luminous zones from 12 female and eight male E. spinax specimens. The results showed that all luminous zones respond to both hormones, with each zone having its own kinetic parameters (maximum light intensity, Lmax; total light emitted, Ltot; time from stimulation to Lmax, TLmax), which confirms the multifunctional character of this shark's luminescence. Ltot and Lmax were found to be directly dependent on the photophore density (PD) of the luminous zone, while TLmax varied independently from PD. In addition, we demonstrate a sexual dimorphism in the luminescent response to PRL, with male specimens having smaller Ltot and TLmax in the luminous zones from the pelvic region. As this region also harbours the sexual organs of this species, this strongly suggests a role for the luminescence from these zones in reproduction."},{"title":"Rhythmic chewing with oral jaws in teleost fishes: a comparison with amniotes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1868","abstract":"Intra-oral prey processing (chewing) using the mandibular jaws occurs more extensively among teleost fishes than previously documented. The lack of muscle spindles, γ-motoneurons and periodontal afferents in fishes makes them useful for testing hypotheses regarding the relationship between these sensorimotor components and rhythmic chewing in vertebrates. Electromyography (EMG) data from the adductor mandibulae (AM) were used to quantify variation in chew cycle duration in the bowfin Amia, three osteoglossomorphs (bony-tongues), four salmonids and one esocid (pike). All species chewed prey using their oral jaw in repetitive trains of between 3 and 30 consecutive chews, a pattern that resembles cyclic chewing in amniote vertebrates. Variance in rhythmicity was compared within and between lineages using coefficients of variation and Levene's test for homogeneity of variance. These comparisons revealed that some teleosts exhibit degrees of rhythmicity that are comparable to mammalian mastication and higher than in lepidosaurs. Moreover, chew cycle durations in fishes, as in mammals, scale positively with mandible length. Chewing among basal teleosts may be rhythmic because it is stereotyped and inflexible, the result of patterned interactions between sensory feedback and a central pattern generator, because the lack of a fleshy tongue renders jaw–tongue coordination unnecessary and/or because stereotyped opening and closing movements are important for controlling fluid flow in the oral cavity."},{"title":"Carotenoid-based coloration predicts resistance to oxidative damage during immune challenge","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1685","abstract":"Many animal ornaments may have evolved as signals advertising the quality of the bearer. The honesty of the information content of these signals would rely on the costs associated with their expression, these being relatively greater for low-quality than for high-quality individuals. Given the physiological functions of carotenoids, carotenoid-based ornaments could indicate individual immunocompetence, and possibly the ability to mount an immune response at a lower cost. We evaluated whether the red carotenoid-based coloration of male red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) predicts the capacity of the individual to counteract the oxidative stress generated by a cell-mediated immune response. Individuals were subcutaneously injected with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) or phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as a control. We found that eye ring pigmentation predicted the change in the amount of peroxidized lipids (TBARS) in blood after the PHA-induced inflammatory challenge. The degree of pigmentation of this carotenoid-based ornament was also negatively related to individual changes in γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), another biomarker of oxidative stress involved in antioxidant metabolism (i.e. glutathione recycling). However, changes in circulating carotenoids did not significantly explain changes in lipid peroxidation or GGT levels, suggesting that the higher resistance to oxidative stress of those individuals with more pigmented eye rings was not directly mediated by their greater circulating levels of carotenoids. Our results indicate that carotenoid-based coloration can predict not only immune responsiveness (more coloured males mount greater responses) but also an individual's ability to counter the oxidative stress generated during immune challenge (more coloured males experience less oxidative damage when mounting an immune response)."},{"title":"Exceptional high-frequency hearing and matched vocalizations in Australian pygopod geckos","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/11/1876","abstract":"We describe exceptional high-frequency hearing and vocalizations in a genus of pygopod lizards (Delma) that is endemic to Australia. Pygopods are a legless subfamily of geckos and share their highly specialized hearing organ. Hearing and vocalizations of amniote vertebrates were previously thought to differ clearly in their frequency ranges according to their systematic grouping. The upper frequency limit would thus be lowest in chelonians and increasingly higher in crocodilians, lizards, birds and mammals. We report data from four Delma species (D. desmosa, D. fraseri, D. haroldi, D. pax) from the Pilbara region of Western Australia that were studied using recordings of auditory-nerve compound action potentials (CAP) under remote field conditions. Hearing limits and vocalization energy of Delma species extended to frequencies far above those reported for any other lizard group, 14 kHz and >20 kHz, respectively. Their remarkable high-frequency hearing derives from the basilar papilla, and forward masking of CAP responses suggests a unique division of labor between groups of sensory cells within the hearing organ. These data also indicate that rather than having only strictly group-specific frequency ranges, amniote vertebrate hearing is strongly influenced by species-specific physical and ecological constraints."},{"title":"Parental behavior in pythons is responsive to both the hydric and thermal dynamics of the nest","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1691","abstract":"Parental behavior contributes to the success of a diverse array of taxa, and female-only nest attendance is particularly widespread. Python egg-brooding behavior is an intriguing example of female-only nest attendance because it significantly influences several critical developmental variables, namely embryonic predation, hydration, respiration and temperature. During brooding, females predominately adopt a tightly coiled posture that reduces the exchange of heat, water vapor, O2 and CO2 between the nest and clutch environment, which benefits egg water balance at the cost of respiration. To determine the plasticity of this important behavior, we manipulated nest temperature and humidity while monitoring nest–clutch thermal, hydric and respiratory relationships to test the hypothesis that female Children's pythons (Antaresia childreni) modify their egg-brooding behavior due to an interaction between environmental thermal and hydric conditions. During moderate and high nest humidity treatments (23 and 32 g m−3 H2O, respectively), females spent more time coiling tightly when the nest was cooling than when it was warming, which benefited clutch temperature. However, brooding females in low-humidity nest environments (13 g m−3 H2O) showed a high frequency of tight coiling even when the nest was warming; thus, nest temperature and humidity had an interactive effect on egg-brooding behavior in support of our hypothesis. Our results also suggest that certain egg-brooding behaviors (i.e. postural adjustments) are more energetically costly to females than other behaviors (i.e. tight coiling). In sum, we provide empirical support for the adaptive plasticity of python egg-brooding behavior, which offers insight into the general significance of female-only nest attendance in animals."},{"title":"Ant search strategies after interrupted tandem runs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1697","abstract":"Tandem runs are a form of recruitment in ants. During a tandem run, a single leader teaches one follower the route to important resources such as sources of food or better nest sites. In the present study, we investigate what tandem leaders and followers do, in the context of nest emigration, if their partner goes missing. Our experiments involved removing either leaders or followers at set points during tandem runs. Former leaders first stand still and wait for their missing follower but then most often proceed alone to the new nest site. By contrast, former followers often first engage in a Brownian search, for almost exactly the time that their former leader should have waited for them, and then former followers switch to a superdiffusive search. In this way, former followers first search their immediate neighbourhood for their lost leader before becoming ever more wide ranging so that in the absence of their former leader they can often find the new nest, re-encounter the old one or meet a new leader. We also show that followers gain useful information even from incomplete tandem runs. These observations point to the important principle that sophisticated communication behaviours may have evolved as anytime algorithms, i.e. procedures that are beneficial even if they do not run to completion."},{"title":"Mutation of the Drosophila vesicular GABA transporter disrupts visual figure detection","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1717","abstract":"The role of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) release and inhibitory neurotransmission in regulating most behaviors remains unclear. The vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) is required for the storage of GABA in synaptic vesicles and provides a potentially useful probe for inhibitory circuits. However, specific pharmacologic agents for VGAT are not available, and VGAT knockout mice are embryonically lethal, thus precluding behavioral studies. We have identified the Drosophila ortholog of the vesicular GABA transporter gene (which we refer to as dVGAT), immunocytologically mapped dVGAT protein expression in the larva and adult and characterized a dVGATminos mutant allele. dVGAT is embryonically lethal and we do not detect residual dVGAT expression, suggesting that it is either a strong hypomorph or a null. To investigate the function of VGAT and GABA signaling in adult visual flight behavior, we have selectively rescued the dVGAT mutant during development. We show that reduced GABA release does not compromise the active optomotor control of wide-field pattern motion. Conversely, reduced dVGAT expression disrupts normal object tracking and figure–ground discrimination. These results demonstrate that visual behaviors are segregated by the level of GABA signaling in flies, and more generally establish dVGAT as a model to study the contribution of GABA release to other complex behaviors."},{"title":"Comparative visual function in four piscivorous fishes inhabiting Chesapeake Bay","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1751","abstract":"Maintaining optimal visual performance is a difficult task in photodynamic coastal and estuarine waters because of the unavoidable tradeoffs between luminous sensitivity and spatial and temporal resolution, yet the visual systems of coastal piscivores remain understudied despite differences in their ecomorphology and microhabitat use. We therefore used electroretinographic techniques to describe the light sensitivities, temporal properties and spectral sensitivities of the visual systems of four piscivorous fishes common to coastal and estuarine waters of the western North Atlantic: striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) and cobia (Rachycentron canadum). Benthic summer flounder exhibited higher luminous sensitivity and broader dynamic range than the three pelagic foragers. The former were at the more sensitive end of an emerging continuum for coastal fishes. By contrast, pelagic species were comparatively less sensitive, but showed larger day–night differences, consistent with their use of diel light-variant photic habitats. Flicker fusion frequency experiments revealed significant interspecific differences at maximum intensities that correlated with lifestyle and habitat. Spectral responses of most species spanned 400–610 nm, with significant day–night differences in striped bass and bluefish. Anadromous striped bass additionally responded to longer wavelengths, similar to many freshwater fishes. Collectively, these results suggest that pelagic piscivores are well adapted to bright photoclimates, which may be at odds with the modern state of eutrified coastal and estuarine waters that they utilize. Recent anthropogenic degradation of water quality in coastal environments, at a pace faster than the evolution of visual systems, may impede visually foraging piscivores, change selected prey, and eventually restructure ecosystems."},{"title":"Migration-related changes in gene expression in leg muscle of the Christmas Island red crab Gecarcoidea natalis: seasonal preparation for long-distance walking","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1740","abstract":"During their annual breeding migration the Christmas Island land crab Gecarcoidea natalis sustains locomotion aerobically for up to 12 h per day compared with just 10 min during the dry season when their muscles quickly become anaerobic. A seasonal transition to an endurance-muscle phenotype would thus seem essential for migrating crabs. The current study employed a gene discovery approach comparing two expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries, one each for leg muscle from dry (non-migrating) and wet season (migrating) crabs. The 14 most abundant transcripts differed in their representation between the two libraries. The abundances of transcripts of genes predicted to code for different proteins forming contractile muscle components, including actin, troponin and tropomyosin, were significantly different between seasons and thus between physiological states. The shift in the isoform composition of the contractile elements provided evidence for a switch from slow phasic (S1) to slow tonic (S2) fatigue-resistant muscle fibres. A tropomyosin (tm) transcript aligned with a tm isoform of lobster (tmS2), and semi-quantitative RT-PCR confirmed this isoform to be more abundant in the migrating crab muscle. Two LIM protein coding genes, a paxillin-like transcript (pax) and a muscle LIM protein (mlp), were relatively up-regulated in muscle of wet season crabs. These proteins have a fundamental role in muscle development and reconstruction, and their comparative up-regulation is consistent with a remodelling of leg muscle for migration in the wet season. Such a transition would result in an increased representation of aerobic endurance-type fibres concomitant with the greater aerobic exercise capacity of the migrating red crabs."},{"title":"Mast cell population in the frog brain: distribution and influence of thyroid status","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1762","abstract":"In the developing frog brain, the majority of mast cells (MC) are distributed in the pia mater, and some immature MC are located adjacent to the blood capillaries in and around the neuropil. In the adult brain, MC are more numerous than in pre- and pro-metamorphic tadpoles; they are mainly located within the pia mater and are particularly numerous in the choroid plexuses. Many MC are found within the brain ventricles juxtaposed to the ependymal lining. MC are rarely observed in the brain parenchyma. In the adult brain, MC number is much higher than in the brain of post-metamorphic froglets. In the latter, MC number is nearly 2-fold over that found in the pre-metamorphic brain. Treatment of pre- and pro-metamorphic tadpoles with 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) stimulates overall larval development but does not induce a significant change in MC population within the brain. By contrast, treatment with 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) delays larval development and leads to a significant numerical increase of brain MC. In the adult, PTU treatment also has a similar effect whereas hypophysectomy causes a drastic decrease of MC population. The negative effects of hypophysectomy are successfully counteracted by a two-week replacement therapy with homologous pars distalis homogenate. In the adult frog, MC population seems to be refractory to thyroid hormone treatment. The present study on frog brain suggests that pituitary–thyroid axis may be involved in the regulation of MC frequency."},{"title":"Red junglefowl have individual body odors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1619","abstract":"Olfaction may play an important role in regulating bird behavior, and has been suggested to be involved in feather-pecking. We investigated possible differences in the body odors of red junglefowl females by using an automated olfactometer which assessed the ability of trained mice to discriminate between the odors of uropygial gland secretions (the main carrier of potential individual odors in chickens) of six feather-pecked and six non-pecked birds. All mice were clearly able to discriminate between all individual red junglefowl odors, showing that each bird has an individual body odor. We analyzed whether it was more difficult to discriminate between the odors of two feather-pecked, or two non-pecked birds, than it was to discriminate between the odors of two randomly selected birds. This was not the case, suggesting that feather-pecked birds did not share a common odor signature. Analyses using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry showed that the composition of aliphatic carboxylic acids in uropygial gland secretions differed consistently between individuals. However, chemical composition did not vary according to feather-pecking status. We conclude that red junglefowl have individual body odors which appear to be largely based on differences in the relative abundance of aliphatic carboxylic acids, but there is no evidence of systematic differences between the body odors of pecked and non-pecked birds."},{"title":"Comb construction in mixed-species colonies of honeybees, Apis cerana and Apis mellifera","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1659","abstract":"Comb building in mixed-species colonies of Apis cerana and Apis mellifera was studied. Two types of cell-size foundation were made from the waxes of these species and inserted into mixed colonies headed either by an A. cerana or an A. mellifera queen. The colonies did not discriminate between the waxes but the A. cerana cell-size foundation was modified during comb building by the workers of both species. In pure A. cerana colonies workers did not accept any foundation but secreted wax and built on foundation in mixed colonies. Comb building is performed by small groups of workers through a mechanism of self-organisation. The two species cooperate in comb building and construct nearly normal combs but they contain many irregular cells. In pure A. mellifera colonies, the A. cerana cell size was modified and the queens were reluctant to lay eggs on such combs. In pure A. cerana colonies, the A. mellifera cell size was built without any modification but these cells were used either for drone brood rearing or for food storing. The principal elements of comb-building behaviour are common to both species, which indicates that they evolved prior to and were conserved after speciation."},{"title":"The myosin light chain 1 isoform associated with masticatory myosin heavy chain in mammals and reptiles is embryonic/atrial MLC1","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1633","abstract":"We recently reported that masticatory myosin heavy chain (MHC-M) is expressed as the exclusive or predominant MHC isoform in masseter and temporalis muscles of several rodent species, contrary to the prevailing dogma that rodents express almost exclusively MHC isoforms that are typically found in fast limb muscles and not masticatory myosin. We also reported that the same rodent species express the embryonic/atrial isoform of myosin light chain 1 (MLC1E/A) in jaw-closing muscles and not a unique masticatory MLC1 isoform that others have reported as being expressed in jaw-closing muscles of carnivores that express MHC-M. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that MLC1E/A is consistently expressed in jaw-closing muscles whenever MHC-M is expressed as the predominant or exclusive MHC isoform. Jaw-closing muscles, fast and slow limb muscles, and cardiac atria and ventricles of 19 species (six Carnivora species, one Primates species, one Chiroptera species, five marsupial species, an alligator and five turtle species) were analyzed using protein gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing. Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting indicate that MHC-M is the exclusive or predominant MHC isoform in the jaw-closing muscles of each of the studied species. The results from all of the approaches collectively show that MLC1E/A is exclusively or predominantly expressed in jaw-closing muscles of the same species. We conclude that MLC1E/A is the exclusive or predominant MLC1 isoform that is expressed in jaw-closing muscles of vertebrates that express MHC-M, and that a unique masticatory isoform of MLC1 probably does not exist."},{"title":"Minimum viewing angle for visually guided ground speed control in bumblebees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1625","abstract":"To control flight, flying insects extract information from the pattern of visual motion generated during flight, known as optic flow. To regulate their ground speed, insects such as honeybees and Drosophila hold the rate of optic flow in the axial direction (front-to-back) constant. A consequence of this strategy is that its performance varies with the minimum viewing angle (the deviation from the frontal direction of the longitudinal axis of the insect) at which changes in axial optic flow are detected. The greater this angle, the later changes in the rate of optic flow, caused by changes in the density of the environment, will be detected. The aim of the present study is to examine the mechanisms of ground speed control in bumblebees and to identify the extent of the visual range over which optic flow for ground speed control is measured. Bumblebees were trained to fly through an experimental tunnel consisting of parallel vertical walls. Flights were recorded when (1) the distance between the tunnel walls was either 15 or 30 cm, (2) the visual texture on the tunnel walls provided either strong or weak optic flow cues and (3) the distance between the walls changed abruptly halfway along the tunnel's length. The results reveal that bumblebees regulate ground speed using optic flow cues and that changes in the rate of optic flow are detected at a minimum viewing angle of 23–30 deg., with a visual field that extends to approximately 155 deg. By measuring optic flow over a visual field that has a low minimum viewing angle, bumblebees are able to detect and respond to changes in the proximity of the environment well before they are encountered."},{"title":"Wing and body kinematics of takeoff and landing flight in the pigeon (Columba livia)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1651","abstract":"Takeoff and landing are critical phases in a flight. To better understand the functional importance of the kinematic adjustments birds use to execute these flight modes, we studied the wing and body movements of pigeons (Columba livia) during short-distance free-flights between two perches. The greatest accelerations were observed during the second wingbeat of takeoff. The wings were responsible for the majority of acceleration during takeoff and landing, with the legs contributing only one-quarter of the acceleration. Parameters relating to aerodynamic power output such as downstroke amplitude, wingbeat frequency and downstroke velocity were all greatest during takeoff flight and decreased with each successive takeoff wingbeat. This pattern indicates that downstroke velocity must be greater for accelerating flight to increase the amount of air accelerated by the wings. Pigeons used multiple mechanisms to adjust thrust and drag to accelerate during takeoff and decelerate during landing. Body angle, tail angle and wing plane angles all shifted from more horizontal orientations during takeoff to near-vertical orientations during landing, thereby reducing drag during takeoff and increasing drag during landing. The stroke plane was tilted steeply downward throughout takeoff (increasing from −60±5 deg. to −47±1 deg.), supporting our hypothesis that a downward-tilted stroke plane pushes more air rearward to accelerate the bird forward. Similarly, the stroke plane tilted upward during landing (increasing from −1±2 deg. to 17±7 deg.), implying that an upward-tilted stroke plane pushes more air forward to slow the bird down. Rotations of the stroke plane, wing planes and tail were all strongly correlated with rotation of the body angle, suggesting that pigeons are able to redirect aerodynamic force and shift between flight modes through modulation of body angle alone."},{"title":"The spatial frequency tuning of optic-flow-dependent behaviors in the bumblebee Bombus impatiens","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1643","abstract":"Insects use visual estimates of flight speed for a variety of behaviors, including visual navigation, odometry, grazing landings and flight speed control, but the neuronal mechanisms underlying speed detection remain unknown. Although many models and theories have been proposed for how the brain extracts the angular speed of the retinal image, termed optic flow, we lack the detailed electrophysiological and behavioral data necessary to conclusively support any one model. One key property by which different models of motion detection can be differentiated is their spatiotemporal frequency tuning. Numerous studies have suggested that optic-flow-dependent behaviors are largely insensitive to the spatial frequency of a visual stimulus, but they have sampled only a narrow range of spatial frequencies, have not always used narrowband stimuli, and have yielded slightly different results between studies based on the behaviors being investigated. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of the spatial frequency dependence of the centering response in the bumblebee Bombus impatiens using sinusoidal and square wave patterns."},{"title":"Thermal sensitivity of mitochondrial metabolism in two distinct mitotypes of Drosophila simulans: evaluation of mitochondrial plasticity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1665","abstract":"The overall aim of this study was to (1) evaluate the adaptive value of mitochondrial DNA by comparing mitochondrial performance in populations possessing different haplotypes and distribution, and to (2) evaluate the sensitivity of different enzymes of the electron transport system (ETS) during temperature-induced changes. We measured the impact of temperature of mitochondrial respiration and several key enzymes of mitochondrial metabolism in two mitotypes (siII and siIII) of Drosophila simulans. The temperature dependencies of oxygen consumption for mitochondria isolated from flight muscle was assessed with complex I substrates (pyruvate + malate + proline) and with sn glycerol-3-phosphate (to reduce complex III via glycerophosphate dehydrogenase) in both coupled and uncoupled states. Activities of citrate synthase, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), catalase and aconitase, and the excess capacity of COX at high convergent pathway flux were also measured as a function of temperature. Overall, our results showed that functional differences between the two mitotypes are few. Results suggest that differences between the two mitotypes could hardly explain the temperature-specific differences measured in mitochondria performances. It suggests that some other factor(s) may be driving the maintenance of mitotypes. We also show that the different enzymes of the ETS have different thermal sensitivities. The catalytic capacities of these enzymes vary with temperature changes, and the corresponding involvement of the different steps on mitochondrial regulation probably varies with temperature. For example, the excess COX capacity is low, even non-existent, at high and intermediate temperatures (18°C, 24°C and 28°C) whereas it is quite high at a lower temperature (12°C), suggesting release of respiration control by COX at low temperature."},{"title":"Stretch-activated cation channel from larval bullfrog skin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1782","abstract":"Cell-attached patches from isolated epithelial cells from larval bullfrog skin revealed a cation channel that was activated by applying suction (−1 kPa to −4.5 kPa) to the pipette. Activation was characterized by an initial large current spike that rapidly attenuated to a stable value and showed a variable pattern of opening and closing with continuing suction. Current–voltage plots demonstrated linear or inward rectification and single channel conductances of 44–56 pS with NaCl or KCl Ringer's solution as the pipette solution, and a reversal potential (−Vp) of 20–40 mV. The conductance was markedly reduced with N-methyl-D-glucamide (NMDG)-Cl Ringer's solution in the pipette. Neither amiloride nor ATP, which are known to stimulate an apical cation channel in Ussing chamber preparations of larval frog skin, produced channel activation nor did these compounds affect the response to suction. Stretch activation was not affected by varying the pipette concentrations of Ca2+ between 0 mmol l−1 and 4 mmol l−1 or by varying pH between 6.8 and 8.0. However, conductance was reduced with 4 mmol l−1 Ca2+. Western blot analysis of membrane homogenates from larval bullfrog and larval toad skin identified proteins that were immunoreactive with mammalian TRPC1 and TRPC5 (TRPC, canonical transient receptor potential channel) antibodies while homogenates of skin from newly metamorphosed bullfrogs were positive for TRPC1 and TRPC3/6/7 antibodies. The electrophysiological response of larval bullfrog skin resembles that of a stretch-activated cation channel characterized in Xenopus oocytes and proposed to be TRPC1. These results indicate this channel persists in all life stages of anurans and that TRP isoforms may be important for sensory functions of their skin."},{"title":"Age-related differences in skeletal muscle lipid profiles of Weddell seals: clues to developmental changes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1676","abstract":"Our objective was to elucidate age-related changes in lipids associated with skeletal muscle of Weddell seals and to suggest possible physiological implications. Muscle biopsies were collected from pups, juveniles and adults in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica and analyzed for intramuscular lipid (IML) and triacylglyceride (IMTG) amounts, fatty acid groups, as well as individual fatty acid profiles. The results from this study suggest a switch from primarily saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in the skeletal muscle of young pups to increases in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as the percentage of blubber increases, resulting in possible thermoregulatory benefits. As Weddell pups continue to develop into juveniles, fatty acids associated with the skeletal muscle changes such that MUFA levels are relatively higher, which may be in response to energy depletion associated with their restricted diving ability and rapid growth. As juveniles transform into adults, a reduction in n-3 PUFA levels in the muscle as the percentage of blubber increases may be indicative of a trigger to prepare for deep diving or could be a mechanism for oxygen conservation during long-duration dives. We speculate that the observed change in lipids associated with the skeletal muscle of Weddell seals is related to ontogenetic differences in thermoregulation and locomotion."},{"title":"Drosophila fly straight by fixating objects in the face of expanding optic flow","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1771","abstract":"Flies, like all animals that depend on vision to navigate through the world, must integrate the optic flow created by self-motion with the images generated by prominent features in their environment. Although much is known about the responses of Drosophila melanogaster to rotating flow fields, their reactions to the more complex patterns of motion that occur as they translate through the world are not well understood. In the present study we explore the interactions between two visual reflexes in Drosophila: object fixation and expansion avoidance. As a fly flies forward, it encounters an expanding visual flow field. However, recent results have demonstrated that Drosophila strongly turn away from patterns of expansion. Given the strength of this reflex, it is difficult to explain how flies make forward progress through a visual landscape. This paradox is partially resolved by the finding reported here that when undergoing flight directed towards a conspicuous object, Drosophila will tolerate a level of expansion that would otherwise induce avoidance. This navigation strategy allows flies to fly straight when orienting towards prominent visual features."},{"title":"Ultradian components in the locomotor activity rhythms of the genetically normal mouse, Mus musculus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1788","abstract":"Ultradian periodicities in physiological processes have been reported for a wide variety of organisms and may appear as bouts in locomotor activity. In some instances, this temporal organization can be related to some ethological strategy. In mice, however, ultradian rhythms have been reported largely in animals with circadian pacemakers disrupted either by genetic or surgical manipulation. Using analysis techniques capable of resolving periodicities in the ultradian range in the presence of strong diel periodicity, we found unequivocal evidence of ultradian rhythms in mice entrained to an light:dark cycle. We collected locomotor activity data of individuals from 11 genetically disparate strains of mice whose activity was recorded in 12 h:12 h L:D photoperiods for 3 days. Data were subjected to maximum entropy spectral analysis and autocorrelation, both before and after filtering to remove the 24-h periodicity. We found that every strain had a majority of individuals with strong ultradian rhythms ranging from ~3 to ~5 h. These periodicities were commonly visible in individual animals both in high-pass-filtered and in unfiltered data. Furthermore, when all raw data from a given strain were pooled to get a 24-h ensemble average across all animals and days, the rhythms continued to be discernable. We fitted Fourier series to these form estimates to model the frequency structure of each strain and found significant effects of strain and an interaction between period and strain indicating significant genetic variation for rhythmicity in the ultradian range. The techniques employed in this study should have wider use in a range of organisms and fields."},{"title":"Immune-system activation depletes retinal carotenoids in house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1709","abstract":"The costs of developing, maintaining, and activating the immune system have been cited as an important force shaping life-history evolution in animals. Immunological defenses require energy, nutrients and time that might otherwise be devoted to other life-history traits like sexual displays or reproduction. Carotenoid pigments in animals provide a unique opportunity to track the costs of immune activation, because they are diet-derived, modulate the immune system, and are used to develop colorful signals of quality. Carotenoids also accumulate in the retinas of birds, where they tune spectral sensitivity and provide photoprotection. If carotenoid accumulation in the retina follows the patterns of other tissues, then immune activation may deplete retinal carotenoid levels and impact visual health and function. To test this hypothesis, we challenged molting wild-caught captive house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) with weekly injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) over the course of 8 weeks. Immunostimulated adult males and females produced significant antibody responses and molted more slowly than uninjected control birds. After 8 weeks, immune-challenged birds had significantly lower levels of specific retinal carotenoid types (galloxanthin and zeaxanthin), but there were no significant differences in the plasma, liver or feather carotenoid levels between the treatment groups. These results indicate that immune-system activation can specifically deplete retinal carotenoids, which may compromise visual health and performance and represent an additional somatic and behavioral cost of immunity."},{"title":"Phosphorylation state of the Na+–K+–Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1) in the gills of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) during acclimation to water of varying salinity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1558","abstract":"Euryhaline teleosts such as Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) are able to acclimate to changing environmental salinity by tightly regulating NaCl absorption and secretion across their gills. Many studies have examined the mechanisms responsible for long-term (days) salinity acclimation; however, much remains unknown about the mechanisms of acute (hours) salinity acclimation. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that phosphorylation of the Na+–K+–Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1) located in the basolateral membrane of the gill plays a role in acute salinity acclimation and that changes in NKCC1 phosphorylation are mediated by a cAMP–protein kinase A (cAMP–PKA) pathway. Using a phospho-specific antibody, we determined the time course of changes in total and phosphorylated NKCC1 protein during acclimation to water of various salinities. Long-term (≥14 days) acclimation of killifish to seawater (SW) and 2× SW resulted in 4- to 6-fold and 5- to 8-fold increases, respectively, in total gill NKCC1 protein relative to fish maintained in freshwater (FW). NKCC1 was found to be between 20% and 70% activated in fish, with lower average activation in fish acclimated to SW and 2× SW compared with FW fish. Increases and decreases in the fractional level of NKCC1 phosphorylation were seen within 1 h of transfer of fish to water of higher and lower salinity, respectively, consistent with a regulatory role of phosphorylation prior to an increase in the biosynthesis of NKCC1; large changes in protein expression of NKCC1 were observed over periods of hours to days. We found that NKCC1 phosphorylation is acutely regulated in the killifish gill in response to changing environmental salinity and that phosphorylation in excised gills increases in response to forskolin stimulation of the cAMP–PKA pathway. The role of phosphorylation is further underscored by the observation that mRNA expression of sterile 20 (Ste20)-related proline–alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) changes with salinity acclimation, being 2.7-fold greater in SW-acclimated killifish relative to FW fish. Overall, these results demonstrate an important role of NKCC1 phosphorylation in the gill of Atlantic killifish during acute salinity acclimation."},{"title":"ATP-induced temperature independence of hemoglobin–O2 affinity in heterothermic billfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1579","abstract":"The inverse relationship between temperature and hemoglobin–O2 affinity resulting from the exothermic nature of heme oxygenation favors O2 unloading from blood to warm, metabolically active tissues. However, this temperature sensitivity is maladaptive, and commonly countered in regional heterotherms, where it may hamper unloading (e.g. in cold extremities of arctic mammals) or increase the diffusive arterio-venous short-circuiting of O2 (e.g. in counter-current heat exchangers of warm swimming muscles of tuna). We hypothesized analogous blood specializations in heterothermic billfish, whose warm eyes and brains increase the temporal resolution of vision, and measured hemoglobin–O2 binding properties in three species over a wide pH range, at two temperatures, and in the absence and presence of the major red cell effector, ATP, permitting detailed assessment of overall oxygenation enthalpies (ΔH′) and contributions from oxygenation-linked proton and ATP dissociation. Billfish express multiple isohemoglobins with similar O2 affinities and pronounced sensitivities to pH and ATP. Compared with the moderate effects associated with proton dissociation upon oxygenation, dissociation of ATP and coupled extra Bohr protons virtually obliterates the temperature sensitivities. At pH 7.4, where this effect is maximal, ATP changes ΔH′ values of blue marlin, striped marlin and shortbill spearfish hemoglobins from −39, −49 and −44 kJ mol−1 O2, respectively, to +26, +4 and −7 kJ mol−1. Thus in addition to allosterically modulating hemoglobin–O2 affinity, ATP diminishes its temperature sensitivity, reducing deleterious arterio-venous short-circuiting of oxygen in the cranial billfish heat exchangers. The mechanism underlying this reduction in oxygenation enthalpy differs fundamentally from that in tuna, supporting independent evolution of this trait in these scombroid lineages."},{"title":"Frequency coding of particle motion by saccular afferents of a teleost fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1591","abstract":"The saccule is known to play an important role in hearing in fishes. In this study we investigated spatial frequency selectivity of single saccular afferents in a teleost fish (the sleeper goby, Dormitator latifrons) to acoustic particle motion at 50–400 Hz. Saccular afferents have similar distributions of best sensitivity (−90.0 to −54.8 dB re. 1 g, mean ± s.d.=−81.1±8.0 dB) and characteristic frequencies (≤50–400 Hz, median=80 Hz) along the longitudinal, side-to-side and dorsoventral axes of fish. They were lowpass, bandpass or broadly tuned to low frequencies with Q50% at 15 dB above threshold in ranges from 0.28 to 3.30 (1.46±0.71), 0.18 to 2.54 (1.36±0.78), and 0.41 to 4.26 (2.25±0.1.12) along the three axes, showing slightly greater frequency tuning in the vertical axis than horizontal axes. At supra threshold we found tuning plasticity, i.e. best frequencies of saccular afferents shifted to high frequencies as stimulus level increased. Isolevel rate–frequency curves were asymmetrical with shallow slopes at the low-frequency edge and steep slopes at the high-frequency edge. Saccular afferents of the sleeper goby have similar capabilities of coding particle motion frequencies in the three orthogonal axes. Results from this and other studies suggest that (1) the saccule is the major hearing organ in this species, (2) the saccule of this species is capable of encoding sound frequencies in three dimensional space, and (3) saccular afferents in fishes without accessory auditory structures exhibit similar frequency selectivity in response to particle motion."},{"title":"Gender expression and group size: a test in a hermaphroditic and a gonochoric congeneric species of Ophryotrocha (Polychaeta)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1586","abstract":"Hermaphroditism and gonochorism are two contrasting forms of sexuality. Hermaphroditic species are generally seen as species adapted to conditions of low density, stabilized by poor mate search efficiency and high costs of searching. They can adjust allocation of reproductive resources to each sex function in response to current social conditions, making reproduction more efficient, at least in principle. By contrast, gonochorism (separate sexes) is advantageous when mates are frequent, making it ineffective to maintain two sex functions in a single individual. This, however, also rules out the need for a flexible response to mating opportunities as known for hermaphrodites. In the hermaphroditic marine polychaete worm Ophryotrocha diadema we showed earlier that group size is assessed through a chemical cue. In this study we verified the accuracy of the response to gradients of the chemical cue used to assess group size by O. diadema by checking reduction in egg production as the group of partners increases, as expected according to sex allocation theory. Furthermore we compared the effect of such a gradient with a similar gradient in a closely related gonochoric species (O. labronica). Here sex allocation adjustment is not predicted, thus an adaptive change in egg production in response to group-size cues is not expected. In fact, our results show that the group-size effect only occurs in O. diadema and not in O. labronica. Moreover, our study provides evidence of high perceptual abilities of chemical cues in O. diadema, suggesting that perceiving social cues and adjusting sex allocation appropriately are special properties of hermaphrodites."},{"title":"Frequency tuning and intensity coding of sound in the auditory periphery of the lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1567","abstract":"Acipenser fulvescens, the lake sturgeon, belongs to one of the few extant non-teleost ray-finned (bony) fishes.

The study reported here is the first investigation of peripheral coding strategies for spectral analysis in the auditory system in a non-teleost bony fish. We used a shaker system to simulate the particle motion component of sound during electrophysiological recordings of isolated single units from the eighth nerve innervating the saccule and lagena. Background activity and response characteristics of saccular and lagenar afferents (such as thresholds, response–level functions and temporal firing) resembled the ones found in teleosts. The distribution of best frequencies also resembled data in teleosts (except for Carassius auratus, goldfish) tested with the same stimulation method. The saccule and lagena in A. fulvescens contain otoconia, in contrast to the solid otoliths found in teleosts, however, this difference in otolith structure did not appear to affect threshold, frequency tuning, intensity- or temporal responses of auditory afferents. In general, the physiological characteristics common to A. fulvescens, teleosts and land vertebrates reflect important functions of the auditory system that may have been conserved throughout the evolution of vertebrates."},{"title":"Sonation in the male common snipe (Capella gallinago gallinago L.) is achieved by a flag-like fluttering of their tail feathers and consequent vortex shedding","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1602","abstract":"Male common snipe (Capella gallinago gallinago) produce a ‘drumming’ sound with their outer tail feathers during their mating dives, but little is known about how this is achieved. We investigated the movements and sound producing capabilities of the outer tail feathers. Using a wind tunnel, we compared observations of the frequencies of sound produced with the predictions from aerodynamic theory. The feathers were also filmed in an air-flow with a high speed video camera, and subjected to morphological examination and biomechanical testing. We propose a mechanistic hypothesis of how the modified outer feathers of the male common snipe generate sound, and the adaptations that facilitate this. Video and audio analysis of the feather demonstrated that a fluttering of the trailing vane generated the sound. The flutter of the vane is facilitated by the rearward curvature of the feather shaft, reduced branching angles of the barbs in the trailing vane and the lack of hooks on the barbs along a hinge region, all of which increase its flexural compliance. Sound production occurred at the same frequency as the vane movements, at frequencies consistent with it being produced by a fluttering flag mechanism powered by vortex shedding."},{"title":"Detective mice assess relatedness in baboons using olfactory cues","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1399","abstract":"The assessment of relatedness may be crucial in the evolution of socio-sexual behaviour, because it can be associated with fitness benefits mediated by both nepotism and inbreeding avoidance. In this context, one proposed mechanism for kin recognition is ‘phenotype matching’; animals might compare phenotypic similarities between themselves and others in order to assess the probability that they are related. Among cues potentially used for kin discrimination, body odours constitute interesting candidates that have been poorly investigated in anthropoid primates so far, because of a mixture of theoretical considerations and methodological/experimental constraints. In this study, we used an indirect approach to examine the similarity in odour signals emitted by related individuals from a natural population of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). For that purpose, we designed an innovative behavioural tool using mice olfactory abilities in a habituation–discrimination paradigm. We show that: (i) mice can detect odour differences between individuals of same sex and age class in another mammal species, and (ii) mice perceive a higher odour similarity between related baboons than between unrelated baboons. These results suggest that odours may play a role in both the signalling of individual characteristics and of relatedness among individuals in an anthropoid primate. The ‘biological olfactometer’ developed in this study offers new perspectives to the exploration of olfactory signals from a range of species."},{"title":"The mechanics of azimuth control in jumping by froghopper insects","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1406","abstract":"Many animals move so fast that there is no time for sensory feedback to correct possible errors. The biomechanics of the limbs participating in such movements appear to be configured to simplify neural control. To test this general principle, we analysed how froghopper insects control the azimuth direction of their rapid jumps, using high speed video of the natural movements and modelling to understand the mechanics of the hind legs. We show that froghoppers control azimuth by altering the initial orientation of the hind tibiae; their mean angle relative to the midline closely predicts the take-off azimuth. This applies to jumps powered by both hind legs, or by one hind leg. Modelling suggests that moving the two hind legs at different times relative to each other could also control azimuth, but measurements of natural jumping showed that the movements of the hind legs were synchronised to within 32 μs of each other. The maximum timing difference observed (67 μs) would only allow control of azimuth over 0.4 deg. to either side of the midline. Increasing the timing differences between the hind legs is also energetically inefficient because it decreases the energy available and causes losses of energy to body spin; froghoppers with just one hind leg spin six times faster than intact ones. Take-off velocities also fall. The mechanism of azimuth control results from the mechanics of the hind legs and the resulting force vectors of their tibiae. This enables froghoppers to have a simple transform between initial body position and motion trajectory, therefore potentially simplifying neural control."},{"title":"Serotonin prolongs survival of encapsulated pond snail embryos exposed to long-term anoxia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1529","abstract":"Embryos of the pond snail, Helisoma trivolvis, develop bilateral serotonergic neurons that innervate ciliary bands and stimulate cilia-driven rotation. This behaviour is postulated to increase oxygen availability during hypoxia by mixing the capsular fluid. We hypothesised that the stimulation of ciliary-driven rotation by serotonin (5-HT) enhances the survival of embryos during prolonged hypoxia. Embryo rotation and survival were monitored in different levels of oxygen for 24–48 h while in the presence or absence of 5-HT (100 μmol l−1) or a 5-HT antagonist (50 μmol l−1). Long-term hypoxia caused delayed embryonic development that appeared morphologically normal. Hypoxia also induced a transient increase in rotation rate in embryos exposed to artificial pond water (APW) or 5-HT that lasted around 3 h. 5-HT-treated embryos had an elevated rotation rate over embryos in APW throughout the long-term exposure to hypoxia. Long-term anoxia also induced a transient increase in rotation rate in embryos exposed to APW or 5-HT. Rotation ceased in embryos exposed to APW by 13 h but persisted in 5-HT-treated embryos for up to 40 h. Fifty percent mortality was reached at 9 h of anoxia in embryos in APW and at 24 h in 5-HT-treated embryos. The 5-HT antagonist mianserin partially inhibited the 5-HT enhancement of rotation but not the prolongation of survival in anoxia. The ability of 5-HT to prolong survival in anoxia reveals a 5-HT-activated metabolic pathway that liberates an alternative energy source."},{"title":"The functional morphology of hooding in cobras","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1521","abstract":"Many snakes, particularly cobras, form as part of a defensive display, a hood, an active lateral expansion of their neck skin and underlying musculature and ribs. We identified muscle groups possibly involved in hooding based on their attachments on the specialized ribs of the neck. We then used a combination of morphology, kinematic analysis, morphometrics, electromyography and muscle stimulation to test hypotheses about the functional basis of hooding. We confirmed that hood protraction and erection is an active process that begins cranially and extends caudally, often in stages, through the combined action of several sets of muscles. One set of axial muscles (levator costae and supracostalis lateralis superior) coursing along a line of action to rib displacement are the prime erectors acting to lift the hood. However, a second set of muscles connecting ribs to skin primarily keep the skin taut, rather than to displace the ribs relative to the vertebrae. A third set of muscles coursing between ribs function primarily to transmit forces between adjacent ribs rather than to move ribs. The maintenance of the erect hood requires continued muscle activity. Hood relaxation is due to both active muscle contraction of a fourth set of axial muscles and to passive recoil events in the costovertebral ligaments. The shape of the fully erect hood is reflective of the morphometrics of the underlying ribs, while the duration and kinematics of hood erection and relaxation are related to the behavioral context of the display."},{"title":"Chitosan produces potent neuroprotection and physiological recovery following traumatic spinal cord injury","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1513","abstract":"Chitosan, a non-toxic biodegradable polycationic polymer with low immunogenicity, has been extensively investigated in various biomedical applications. In this work, chitosan has been demonstrated to seal compromised nerve cell membranes thus serving as a potent neuroprotector following acute spinal cord trauma. Topical application of chitosan after complete transection or compression of the guinea pig spinal cord facilitated sealing of neuronal membranes in ex vivo tests, and restored the conduction of nerve impulses through the length of spinal cords in vivo, using somatosensory evoked potential recordings. Moreover, chitosan preferentially targeted damaged tissues, served as a suppressor of reactive oxygen species (free radical) generation, and the resultant lipid peroxidation of membranes, as shown in ex vivo spinal cord samples. These findings suggest a novel medical approach to reduce the catastrophic loss of behavior after acute spinal cord and brain injury."},{"title":"Background colour matching by a crab spider in the field: a community sensory ecology perspective","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1425","abstract":"The question of whether a species matches the colour of its natural background in the perspective of the correct receiver is complex to address for several reasons; however, the answer to this question may provide invaluable support for functional interpretations of colour. In most cases, little is known about the identity and visual sensory abilities of the correct receiver and the precise location at which interactions take place in the field, in particular for mimetic systems. In this study, we focused on Misumena vatia, a crab spider meeting the criteria for assessing crypsis better than many other models, and claimed to use colour changes for both aggressive and protective crypsis. We carried out a systematic field survey to quantitatively assess the exactness of background colour matching in M. vatia with respect to the visual system of many of its receivers within the community. We applied physiological models of bird, bee and blowfly colour vision, using flower and spider spectral reflectances measured with a spectroradiometer. We observed that crypsis at long distance is systematically achieved, exclusively through achromatic contrast, in both bee and bird visions. At short distance, M. vatia is mostly chromatically detectable, whatever the substrate, for bees and birds. However, spiders can be either poorly discriminable or quite visible depending on the substrate for bees. Spiders are always chromatically undetectable for blowflies. We discuss the biological relevance of these results in both defensive and aggressive contexts of crypsis within a community sensory perspective."},{"title":"Place learning by mechanical contact","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1436","abstract":"For some animals (e.g. the night-active wandering spider) the encounters with the habitat that result in place learning are predominantly mechanical. We asked whether place learning limited to mechanical contact, like place learning in general, entails vectors tied to individual landmarks and relations between landmarks. We constructed minimal environments for blindfolded human participants. Landmarks were raised steps. ‘Home’ was a mechanically indistinct location. Travel was linear. The mechanical contacts were those of walking, stepping, and probing with a soft-tipped cane. Home-orienting activities preceded tests of finding home from a given location with landmarks unchanged or (unbeknown to participants) shifted. In a one-landmark environment, perceived home shifted in the same direction, with the same magnitude, as the shifted landmark. In an environment of two landmarks located in the same direction from home, shifting the further landmark toward home resulted in a change in home's perceived location that preserved the original ratio of distances separating home, nearer landmark, and further landmark. Both findings were invariant over the travel route to the test location and repetitions of testing. It seems, therefore, that for humans (and, perhaps, for wandering spiders), mechanical contact can reveal the vectors and relations specifying places."},{"title":"Hand and foot pressures in the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) reveal novel biomechanical trade-offs required for walking on gracile digits","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1549","abstract":"Arboreal animals with prehensile hands must balance the complex demands of bone strength, grasping and manipulation. An informative example of this problem is that of the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), a rare lemuriform primate that is unusual in having exceptionally long, gracile fingers specialized for foraging. In addition, they are among the largest primates to engage in head-first descent on arboreal supports, a posture that should increase loads on their gracile digits. We test the hypothesis that aye-ayes will reduce pressure on their digits during locomotion by curling their fingers off the substrate. This hypothesis was tested using simultaneous videographic and pressure analysis of the hand, foot and digits for five adult aye-ayes during horizontal locomotion and during ascent and descent on a 30° instrumented runway. Aye-ayes consistently curled their fingers during locomotion on all slopes. When the digits were in contact with the substrate, pressures were negligible and significantly less than those experienced by the palm or pedal digits. In addition, aye-ayes lifted their hands vertically off the substrate instead of ‘toeing-off’ and descended head-first at significantly slower speeds than on other slopes. Pressure on the hand increased during head-first descent relative to horizontal locomotion but not as much as the pressure increased on the foot during ascent. This distribution of pressure suggests that aye-ayes shift their weight posteriorly during head-first descent to reduce loads on their gracile fingers. This research demonstrates several novel biomechanical trade-offs to deal with complex functional demands on the mammalian skeleton."},{"title":"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-dependent regulation of the output in lobster olfactory receptor neurons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1417","abstract":"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels often play a role in sensory transduction, including chemosensory transduction. TRP channels, a common downstream target of phosphoinositide (PI) signaling, can be modulated by exogenous phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] and/or diacylglycerol (DAG). Lobster olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) express a TRP-related, non-selective, calcium/magnesium-permeable, sodium/calcium-gated cation (SGC) channel. Here we report that PIs regulate the function of the calcium-activated form of the lobster channel. Sequestering of endogenous PI(4,5)P2, either with an anti-PI(4,5)P2 antibody or by electrostatic screening with polyvalent cations, blocks the channel. Exogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 activates the channel independently of intracellular sodium and/or calcium. Exogenous non-hydrolysable DAG analogs fail to change the gating parameters of the channel, suggesting the channel is insensitive to DAG. Electrophysiological recording from lobster ORNs in situ using a panel of pharmacological tools targeting the key components of both PI and DAG metabolism (phospholipase C, phosphoinositide 4-kinase and DAG kinase) extend these findings to the intact ORN. PI(4,5)P2 depletion suppresses both the odorant-evoked discharge and whole-cell current of the cells, and does so possibly independently of DAG production. Collectively, our results argue that PIs can regulate output in lobster ORNs, at least in part through their action on the lobster SGC channel."},{"title":"Aversiveness of sounds in phocid seals: psycho-physiological factors, learning processes and motivation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1536","abstract":"Aversiveness of sounds and its underlying physiological mechanisms in mammals are poorly understood. In this study we tested the influence of psychophysical parameters, motivation and learning processes on the aversiveness of anthropogenic underwater noise in phocid seals (Halichoerus grypus and Phoca vitulina). We compared behavioural responses of seals to playbacks of sounds based on a model of sensory unpleasantness for humans, sounds from acoustic deterrent devices and sounds with assumed neutral properties in different contexts of food motivation. In a captive experiment with food presentation, seals habituated quickly to all sound types presented at normalised received levels of 146 dB re. 1 μPa (r.m.s., root mean square). However, the fast habituation of avoidance behaviour was also accompanied by a weak sensitisation process affecting dive times and place preference in the pool. Experiments in the wild testing animals without food presentation revealed differential responses of seals to different sound types. We observed avoidance behaviour at received levels of 135–144 dB re. 1 μPa (sensation levels of 59–79 dB). In this experiment, sounds maximised for ‘roughness’ perceived as unpleasant by humans also caused the strongest avoidance responses in seals, suggesting that sensory pleasantness may be the result of auditory processing that is not restricted to humans. Our results highlight the importance of considering the effects of acoustic parameters other than the received level as well as animal motivation and previous experience when assessing the impacts of anthropogenic noise on animals."},{"title":"Insulin-induced hypoglycaemia is co-ordinately regulated by liver and muscle during acute and chronic insulin stimulation in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1443","abstract":"The relative glucose intolerance of carnivorous fish species is often proposed to be a result of poor peripheral insulin action or possibly insulin resistance. In the present study, data from aortic cannulated rainbow trout receiving bovine insulin (75 mIU kg−1) injections show for the first time their ability to clear glucose in a very efficient manner. In another set of experiments, mRNA transcripts and protein phosphorylation status of proteins controlling glycaemia and glucose-related metabolism were studied during both acute and chronic treatment with bovine insulin. Our results show that fasted rainbow trout are well adapted at the molecular level to respond to increases in circulating insulin levels, and that this hormone is able to potentially improve glucose distribution and uptake by peripheral tissues. After acute insulin administration we found that to counter-regulate the insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, trout metabolism is strongly modified. This short-term, efficient response to hypoglycaemia includes a rapid, coordinated response involving the reorganization of muscle and liver metabolism. During chronic insulin treatment some of the functions traditionally attributed to insulin actions in mammals were observed, including increased mRNA levels of glucose transporters and glycogen storage (primarily in the muscle) as well as decreased mRNA levels of enzymes involved in de novo glucose production (in the liver). Finally, we show that the rainbow trout demonstrates most of the classic metabolic adjustments employed by mammals to efficiently utilize glucose in the appropriate insulin context."},{"title":"Effect of acute exposure to low environmental calcium on respiration and locomotion in Lymnaea stagnalis (L.)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1471","abstract":"Environmental calcium is a major factor affecting the distribution of freshwater gastropods. Whilst the effects on growth and morphology are fairly well understood, little is known about how calcium availability affects other aspects of gastropod biology. Lymnaea stagnalis (L.) is considered a calciphile and exhibits reduced growth and survival in environments containing less than 20 mg l−1 Ca2+. Many freshwater systems exhibit fluctuations in calcium concentration over time: where calcium levels are normally high there may be periods of low [Ca2+], for example following periods of flooding. Here we examined the effects of acute periods of low (20 mg l−1) environmental calcium on the physiology and behaviour of L. stagnalis, specifically measuring how locomotion and respiration differ between high calcium (80 mg l−1) and low calcium (20 mg l−1) environments. We found that in a low calcium environment crawling speed is reduced, and that this coincides with an increase in cutaneous respiration, indicating that the increased metabolic demands of calcium acquisition at low [Ca2+] reduce the energy available for locomotion. Conversely we found a decrease in aerial respiration in hypoxic conditions in the low calcium relative to the high calcium environment. In conclusion, we found that acute exposure to low environmental calcium has a highly significant effect on locomotion and respiration, which may have consequences for snail fitness when no morphological effects are apparent."},{"title":"Variation in the seasonal patterns of innate and adaptive immunity in the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1477","abstract":"The primary function of the immune system is to protect the organism from invading pathogens. In vertebrates, this has resulted in a multifaceted system comprised of both innate and adaptive components. The immune system of all jawed vertebrates is complex, but unlike the endothermic vertebrates, relatively little is known about the functioning of the ectothermic vertebrate immune system, especially the reptilian system. Because turtles are long-lived ectotherms, factors such as temperature and age may affect their immune response, but comprehensive studies are lacking. We investigated variation in immune responses of adult male and female red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta) across the entire active season. We characterized seasonal variation in innate, cell-mediated and humoral components via bactericidal capacity of plasma, delayed-type hypersensitivity and total immunoglobulin levels, respectively. Results indicate that all immune measures varied significantly across the active season, but each measure had a different pattern of variation. Interestingly, temperature alone does not explain the observed seasonal variation. Immune measures did not vary between males and females, but immunoglobulin levels did vary with age. This study demonstrates the highly dynamic nature of the reptilian immune system, and provides information on how biotic and abiotic factors influence the immune system of a long-lived ectotherm."},{"title":"A multi-stage anti-predator response increases information on predation risk","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1484","abstract":"Optimal escape theory generally assumes that animals have accurate information about predator distance and direction of approach. To what degree such information is available depends not only on the prey's sensory capabilities but also on its behaviour. The structure of behaviour can strongly constrain or support the gathering of information. The ability of animals to collect and process information is therefore an important factor shaping predator avoidance strategies. Fiddler crabs, like many prey animals, escape predators in a multi-step sequence. In their initial response, they do not have accurate information about a predator's distance and approach trajectory and are forced to base their response decision on incomplete information that is not strictly correlated with risk. We show here that fiddler crabs gather qualitatively different visual information during successive stages of their escape sequence. This suggests that multi-stage anti-predator behaviours serve not only to successively reduce risk but also to increase the quality of information with regards to the actual risk. There are countless reasons why prey animals are not able to accurately assess risk. By concentrating on sensory limitations, we can quantify such information deficits and investigate how improving risk assessment helps prey optimise the balance between predation risk and escape costs."},{"title":"Diapause termination and development of encysted Artemia embryos: roles for nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1464","abstract":"Encysted embryos (cysts) of the brine shrimp Artemia undergo diapause, a state of profound dormancy and enhanced stress tolerance. Upon exposure to the appropriate physical stimulus diapause terminates and embryos resume development. The regulation of diapause termination and post-diapause development is poorly understood at the molecular level, prompting this study on the capacity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) to control these processes. Exposure to H2O2 and NO, the latter generated by the use of three NO generators, promoted cyst development, emergence and hatching, effects nullified by catalase and the NO scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO). The maximal effect of NO and H2O2 on cyst development was achieved by 4 h of exposure to either chemical. NO was effective at a lower concentration than H2O2 but more cysts developed in response to H2O2. Promotion of development varied with incubation conditions, indicating for the first time a population of Artemia cysts potentially arrested in post-diapause and whose development was activated by either H2O2 or NO. A second cyst sub-population, refractory to hatching after prolonged incubation, was considered to be in diapause, a condition broken by H2O2 but not NO. These observations provide clues to the molecular mechanisms of diapause termination and development in Artemia, while enhancing the organism's value in aquaculture by affording a greater understanding of its growth and physiology."},{"title":"Function of the epaxial muscles in walking, trotting and galloping dogs: implications for the evolution of epaxial muscle function in tetrapods","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1490","abstract":"The body axis plays a central role in tetrapod locomotion. It contributes to the work of locomotion, provides the foundation for the production of mechanical work by the limbs, is central to the control of body posture, and integrates limb and trunk actions. The epaxial muscles of mammals have been suggested to mobilize and globally stabilize the trunk, but the timing and the degree to which they serve a particular function likely depend on the gait and the vertebral level. To increase our understanding of their function, we recorded the activity of the m. multifidus lumborum and the m. longissimus thoracis et lumborum at three cranio-caudal levels in dogs while they walked, trotted and galloped. The level of muscle recruitment was significantly higher during trotting than during walking, but was similar during trotting and galloping. During walking, epaxial muscle activity is appropriate to produce lateral bending and resist long-axis torsion of the trunk and forces produced by extrinsic limb muscles. During trotting, they also stabilize the trunk in the sagittal plane against the inertia of the center of mass. Muscle recruitment during galloping is consistent with the production of sagittal extension. The sequential activation along the trunk during walking and galloping is in accord with the previously observed traveling waves of lateral and sagittal bending, respectively, while synchronized activity during trotting is consistent with a standing wave of trunk bending. Thus, the cranio-caudal recruitment patterns observed in dogs resemble plesiomorphic motor patterns of tetrapods. In contrast to other tetrapods, mammals display bilateral activity during symmetrical gaits that provides increased sagittal stability and is related to the evolution of a parasagittal limb posture and greater sagittal mobility."},{"title":"Electrophysiological assessment of spectral sensitivity in adult Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus: evidence for violet sensitivity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1453","abstract":"The cichlid fish radiations of the African Great Lakes are an important model for evolutionary biology. Cichlids have diverse colour vision systems and predominately express three cone visual pigments. However, rare populations of spectrally distinct cones have been found in a number of species, but it is not known whether they contribute to spectral sensitivity. Adult Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, an ancestral outgroup to the cichlid radiations in the Great Lakes, have three cone types: short-wavelength sensitive (SWS), medium-wavelength sensitive (MWS) and long-wavelength sensitive (LWS) cones, but evidence from microspectrophotometry and cone opsin gene expression suggests they may also have violet-sensitive (VS) cones. We used electrophysiology to assess spectral sensitivity in this species and found evidence of four sensitivity peaks in the ranges 380–420, 440–480, 500–600 and 600–680 nm, with maximal sensitivity at longer wavelengths. The continued presence of a 380–420 nm peak under long-wavelength chromatic adapting backgrounds indicates that this is due to a VS cone mechanism not the β-band of the LWS cone mechanism. Differences in spectral sensitivity curves recorded at different times of year revealed evidence of A1/A2 shifts. The presence of notches in the sensitivity curves and a multiple-mechanisms model used to assess cone contributions indicated that the curves are the result of four cone mechanisms (VS, SWS, MWS and LWS cones) and that chromatically opponent processes occur between mechanisms. The spectral transmittance of the lens steeply declines between 410–380 nm, limiting the short-wavelength limb of the VS cone. As adults, Nile tilapia appear to possess the necessary retinal mechanisms for colour vision. While maximal sensitivity to longer wavelengths is an adaptation to the wavelengths of light predominantly available in their natural habitats, their broad sensitivity range suggests that Nile tilapia possess a flexible, generalised visual system able to adapt to changes in visual environment in their highly variable natural habitat."},{"title":"Butterfly wing colors: glass scales of Graphium sarpedon cause polarized iridescence and enhance blue/green pigment coloration of the wing membrane","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/10/1731","abstract":"The wings of the swordtail butterfly Graphium sarpedon nipponum contain the bile pigment sarpedobilin, which causes blue/green colored wing patches.

In the dorsal forewings, the colored patches lack the usual wing scales, but instead have bristles. We have found that on the ventral side most of these patches have very transparent scales that enhance, by reflection, the wing coloration when illuminated from the dorsal side. These glass scales furthermore create a strongly polarized iridescence when illuminated by obliquely incident light from the ventral side, presumably for intraspecific signaling. A few ventral forewing patches have diffusely scattering, white scales that also enhance the blue/green wing coloration when observed from the dorsal side."},{"title":"Ontogenetic scaling of locomotor kinetics and kinematics of the ostrich (Struthio camelus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1347","abstract":"Kinematic and kinetic parameters of running gait were investigated through growth in the ostrich, from two weeks up to 10 months of age, in order to investigate the effects of increasing body size. Ontogenetic scaling relationships were compared with published scaling relationships found to exist with increasing body size between species to determine whether dynamic similarity is maintained during growth. During the study, ostrich mass (Mb) ranged from 0.7 kg to 108.8 kg. Morphological measurements showed that lengths scaled with positive allometry during growth (hip height ∝Mb0.40; foot segment length ∝Mb0.40; tarsometatarsus length ∝Mb0.41; tibiotarsus length ∝Mb0.38; femur length ∝Mb0.37), significantly exceeding the close to geometric scaling observed between mammalian and avian species of increasing body size. Scaling of kinematic variables largely agreed with predicted scaling for increasing size and demonstrated relationships close to dynamic similarity and, as such, ontogenetic scaling of locomotor parameters was similar to that observed with increasing body mass between species. However, the ways in which these scaling trends were achieved were very different, with ontogenetic scaling of locomotor mechanics largely resulting from simple scaling of the limb segments rather than postural changes, likely to be due to developmental constraints. Small deviations from dynamic similarity of kinematic parameters and a reduction in the predicted scaling of limb stiffness (∝Mb0.59) were found to be accounted for by the positive allometric scaling of the limb during growth."},{"title":"Use it or lose it? Sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, a species representing a fifth teleostean group where the βNHE associated with the red blood cell adrenergic stress response has been secondarily lost","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1503","abstract":"Like most teleosts, sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria Pallas 1814) blood exhibits a moderate Root effect (~35% maximal desaturation), where a reduction in blood pH dramatically reduces O2 carrying capacity, a mechanism important for oxygenating the eye and filling the swim bladder (SB) in teleosts. Although sablefish lack a SB, we observed a well-defined choroid rete at the eye. The adrenergically mediated cell swelling typically associated with a functional red blood cell (RBC) β-adrenergic Na+/H+ exchanger (βNHE), which would normally protect RBC pH, and thus O2 transport, during a generalized acidosis, was not observed in sablefish blood. Neither isoproterenol (a β-agonist) nor 8-bromo cAMP could elicit this response. Furthermore, RBC osmotic shrinkage, known to stimulate NHEs in general and βNHE in other teleosts such as trout and flounder, resulted in no significant regulatory volume increase (RVI), further supporting the absence of a functional RBC βNHE. The onset of the Root effect occurs at a much lower RBC pH (6.83–6.92) than in other teleosts, and thus RBC βNHE may not be required to protect O2 transport during a generalized acidosis in vivo. Phylogenetically, sablefish may represent a fifth group of teleosts exhibiting a secondary reduction or loss of βNHE activity. However, sablefish have not lost the choroid rete at the eye (unlike in the other four groups), which may still function with the Root effect to oxygenate the retina, but the low pH onset of the Root effect may ensure haemoglobin (Hb)-O2 binding is not compromised at the respiratory surface during a general acidosis in the absence of RBC βNHE. The sablefish may represent an anomaly within the framework of Root effect evolution, in that they possess a moderate Root effect and a choroid rete at the eye, but lack the RBC βNHE and the SB system."},{"title":"Short-term group fission processes in macaques: a social networking approach","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1338","abstract":"Living in groups necessarily involves a certain amount of within-group competition for food. Group members may have different motivations, implying the reaching of a consensus to stay cohesive. In some cases individuals fail to reach a common decision and the group splits; this can be temporary, as seen in fission–fusion dynamics, or even irreversible. Most studies on fission–fusion dynamics published to date have focused on the influence of environmental constraints on sub-grouping patterns, but little is known about how social relationships affect individual choices for sub-groups. In this study, we used an agent-based model to understand the mechanisms underlying group fission in two semi-free-ranging groups of macaques: one group of Tonkean macaques (Macaca tonkeana) and one of rhesus macaques (M. mulatta). The results showed that sub-grouping patterns were mainly influenced by affiliative relationships. Moreover, the species-specific social style appeared to affect the probability of choosing a particular sub-group. In the tolerant Tonkean macaques, mechanisms underlying sub-grouping patterns resembled anonymous mimetism, while in the nepotistic rhesus macaques, kinship influenced the mechanisms underlying group fissions. As previous studies have shown, fission–fusion society may be a way to avoid social conflicts induced either by food or by social competition."},{"title":"When surfacers do not dive: multiple significance of extended surface times in marine turtles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1328","abstract":"Marine turtles spend more than 90% of their life underwater and have been termed surfacers as opposed to divers. Nonetheless turtles have been reported occasionally to float motionless at the surface but the reasons for this behaviour are not clear. We investigated the location, timing and duration of extended surface times (ESTs) in 10 free-ranging loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and the possible relationship to water temperature and diving activity recorded via satellite relay data loggers for 101–450 days. For one turtle that dived only in offshore areas, ESTs contributed 12% of the time whereas for the other turtles ESTs contributed 0.4–1.8% of the time. ESTs lasted on average 90 min but were mostly infrequent and irregular, excluding the involvement of a fundamental regulatory function. However, 82% of the ESTs occurred during daylight, mostly around noon, suggesting a dependence on solar radiation. For three turtles, there was an appreciable (7°C to 10.5°C) temperature decrease with depth for dives during periods when ESTs occurred frequently, suggesting a re-warming function of EST to compensate for decreased body temperatures, possibly to enhance digestive efficiency. A positive correlation between body mass and EST duration supported this explanation. By contrast, night-active turtles that exceeded their calculated aerobic dive limits in 7.6–16% of the dives engaged in nocturnal ESTs, probably for lactate clearance. This is the first evidence that loggerhead turtles may refrain from diving for at least two reasons, either to absorb solar radiation or to recover from anaerobic activity."},{"title":"Hindlimb interarticular coordinations in Microcebus murinus in maximal leaping","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1320","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the pattern of coordinations of the hindlimb joints in the world's smallest living primate (Microcebus murinus).

We used multidimensional analysis to determine the behavioral responses of six species of leeches to stimulation, as the responses are affected by species identity, diet, behavioral state and stimulus location. Our results show that each of the species tested while not feeding displayed remarkably similar behaviors in response to tactile stimulation of the surface of the body. When not feeding, stimulus location was the most reliable factor in determining behavioral response. While feeding, the three sanguivorous (bloodsucking) species tested ignored stimulation, whereas the three carnivorous leeches abandoned feeding in favor of locomotory responses, regardless of phylogenetic relationships. In the sanguivorous leeches, feeding abolished all mechanically elicited responses and mechanical stimulation in turn had no effect on feeding. We also show that the behavioral hierarchy of leeches was fixed and unchanging even in species that can consume both a carnivorous and a sanguivorous diet."},{"title":"Dynamics of optomotor responses in Drosophila to perturbations in optic flow","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1366","abstract":"For a small flying insect, correcting unplanned course perturbations is essential for navigating through the world. Visual course control relies on estimating optic flow patterns which, in flies, are encoded by interneurons of the third optic ganglion. However, the rules that translate optic flow into flight motor commands remain poorly understood. Here, we measured the temporal dynamics of optomotor responses in tethered flies to optic flow fields about three cardinal axes. For each condition, we used white noise analysis to determine the optimal linear filters linking optic flow to the sum and difference of left and right wing beat amplitudes. The estimated filters indicate that flies react very quickly to perturbations of the motion field, with pure delays in the order of ~20 ms and time-to-peak of ~100 ms. By convolution the filters also predict responses to arbitrary stimulus sequences, accounting for over half the variance in 5 of our 6 stimulus types, demonstrating the approximate linearity of the system with respect to optic flow variables. In the remaining case of yaw optic flow we improved predictability by measuring individual flies, which also allowed us to analyze the variability of optomotor responses within a population. Finally, the linear filters at least partly explain the optomotor responses to superimposed and decomposed compound flow fields."},{"title":"Is there an energetic-based trade-off between thermoregulation and the acute phase response in zebra finches?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1386","abstract":"There has been recent interest in understanding trade-offs between immune function and other fitness-related traits. At proximate levels, such trade-offs are presumed to result from the differential allocation of limited energy resources. Whether the costs of immunity are sufficient to necessitate such energy reallocation remains unclear. We tested the metabolic and behavioural response of male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to the combined effects of thermoregulation and generation of an acute phase response (APR). The APR is the first line of defence against pathogens, and is considered energetically costly. We predicted that at cold temperatures zebra finches would exhibit an attenuated APR when compared with individuals at thermoneutrality. We challenged individuals with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an immunogenic compound that stimulates an APR. Following LPS injection, we measured changes in food intake, body mass, activity, and resting and total energy expenditure. When challenged with LPS under ad libitum food, individuals at both temperatures decreased food intake and activity, resulting in similar mass loss. In contrast to predicted energetic trade-offs, cold-exposed individuals injected with LPS increased their nocturnal resting energy expenditure more than did individuals held at thermoneutrality, yet paradoxically lost less mass overnight. Although responding to LPS was energetically costly, resulting in a 10% increase in resting expenditure and 16% increase in total expenditure, there were few obvious energetic trade-offs. Our data support recent suggestions that the energetic cost of an immune response may not be the primary mechanism driving trade-offs between immune system function and other fitness-related traits."},{"title":"Neural responses to one- and two-tone stimuli in the hearing organ of the dengue vector mosquito","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1376","abstract":"Recent studies demonstrate that mosquitoes listen to each other's wing beats just prior to mating in flight. Field potentials from sound-transducing neurons in the antennae contain both sustained and oscillatory components to pure and paired tone stimuli. Described here is a direct comparison of these two types of response in the dengue vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Across a wide range of frequencies and intensities, sustained responses to one- and two-tone stimuli are about equal in magnitude to oscillatory responses to the beats produced by two-tone stimuli. All of these responses are much larger than the oscillatory responses to one-tone stimuli. Similarly, the frequency range extends up to at least the fifth harmonic of the male flight tone for sustained responses to one- and two-tone stimuli and oscillatory responses at the beat frequency of two-tone stimuli, whereas the range of oscillatory response to a one-tone stimulus is limited to, at most, the third harmonic. Thresholds near the fundamental of the flight tone are lower for oscillatory responses than for sustained deflections, lower for males than for females, and within the behaviorally relevant range. A simple model of the transduction process can qualitatively account for both oscillatory and sustained responses to pure and paired tones. These data leave open the question as to which of several alternative strategies underlie flight tone matching behavior in mosquitoes."},{"title":"A wake-based correlate of swimming performance and foraging behavior in seven co-occurring jellyfish species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1217","abstract":"It is generally accepted that animal–fluid interactions have shaped the evolution of animals that swim and fly. However, the functional ecological advantages associated with those adaptations are currently difficult to predict on the basis of measurements of the animal–fluid interactions. We report the identification of a robust, fluid dynamic correlate of distinct ecological functions in seven jellyfish species that represent a broad range of morphologies and foraging modes. Since the comparative study is based on properties of the vortex wake – specifically, a fluid dynamical concept called optimal vortex formation – and not on details of animal morphology or phylogeny, we propose that higher organisms can also be understood in terms of these fluid dynamic organizing principles. This enables a quantitative, physically based understanding of how alterations in the fluid dynamics of aquatic and aerial animals throughout their evolution can result in distinct ecological functions."},{"title":"High-precision tracking of sperm swimming fine structure provides strong test of resistive force theory","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1226","abstract":"The shape of the flagellar beat determines the path along which a sperm cell swims. If the flagellum bends periodically about a curved mean shape then the sperm will follow a path with non-zero curvature. To test a simple hydrodynamic theory of flagellar propulsion known as resistive force theory, we conducted high-precision measurements of the head and flagellum motions during circular swimming of bull spermatozoa near a surface. We found that the fine structure of sperm swimming represented by the rapid wiggling of the sperm head around an averaged path is, to high accuracy, accounted for by resistive force theory and results from balancing forces and torques generated by the beating flagellum. We determined the anisotropy ratio between the normal and tangential hydrodynamic friction coefficients of the flagellum to be 1.81±0.07 (mean±s.d.). On time scales longer than the flagellar beat cycle, sperm cells followed circular paths of non-zero curvature. Our data show that path curvature is approximately equal to twice the average curvature of the flagellum, consistent with quantitative predictions of resistive force theory. Hence, this theory accurately predicts the complex trajectories of sperm cells from the detailed shape of their flagellar beat across different time scales."},{"title":"Deployment of hagfish slime thread skeins requires the transmission of mixing forces via mucin strands","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1235","abstract":"Hagfishes are benthic marine protovertebrates that secrete copious quantities of slime when threatened. The slime originates as a two-component glandular exudate comprised of coiled bundles of cytoskeletal intermediate filaments (thread skeins) and mucin vesicles. Holocrine secretion of the slime into seawater results in the rapid deployment of both fibrous and mucin components, resulting in about a liter of dilute slime. Deployment of the thread skeins involves their unraveling in a fraction of a second from a 150 μm-long ellipsoid bundle to a thread that is 100× longer. We hypothesized that thread skein deployment requires both vigorous hydrodynamic mixing and the presence of mucin vesicles, both of which are required for whole slime deployment. Here we provide evidence that mixing and mucin vesicles are indeed crucial for skein unraveling. Specifically, we show that mucin vesicles mixed into seawater swell and elongate into high-aspect ratio mucin strands that attach to the thread skeins, transmit hydrodynamic forces to them and effect their unraveling by loading them in tension. Our discovery of mucin strands in hagfish slime not only provides a mechanism for the rapid deployment of thread skeins in vivo, it also helps explain how hagfish slime is able to trap such impressive volumes of seawater via viscous entrainment. We believe that the deployment of thread skeins via their interaction with shear-elongated mucins represents a unique mechanism in biology and may lead to novel technologies for transmitting hydrodynamic forces to microscale particles that would typically be immune to such forces."},{"title":"It's tough to be small: dependence of burrowing kinematics on body size","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1241","abstract":"Burrowing marine infauna are morphologically diverse and range in size over several orders of magnitude. Whilst effects of ontogenetic and morphological differences on running, flying and swimming are relatively well understood, similar analyses of burrowing mechanics and kinematics are lacking. The polychaete Nereis virens Sars extends its burrow by fracture, using an eversible pharynx to exert force on the walls of the burrow. The resulting stress is amplified at the anterior tip of the burrow, which extends when the stress exceeds the fracture toughness of the material. Here we show that the polychaete Cirriformia moorei extends its burrow by a similar mechanism, but by using its hydrostatic skeleton rather than an eversible pharynx. Based on the dimensionless wedge number, which relates work of fracture to work to maintain body shape against the elasticity of sediment, we predicted that smaller worms would exhibit behaviors characteristic of tougher sediments and that scaling of kinematics would reflect decreasing difficulty in fracturing sediment with increasing body size. We found that smaller worms were relatively blunter and thicker, and had a greater variation of thickness than larger worms as they burrowed. Although these kinematic differences increase the stress amplification at the crack tip, smaller worms still generate lower stress intensity factors. The greater relative body thickness and shape changes of smaller worms are consistent with ontogenetic changes in forces exerted by earthworms, and are likely driven by the challenge of exerting enough stress to extend a crack with a small body size."},{"title":"Fuel switching and energy partitioning during the postprandial metabolic response in the ball python (Python regius)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1266","abstract":"Digestion, absorption and assimilation of the meal are active processes that require start-up energy before the energy contained in a meal can be utilized.

We used 13C-labelled prey to partition between endogenous energy sources (i.e. snakes own resources) and exogenous energy sources (i.e. prey). A linear mixing model was then applied to determine the portion of 13C originating from the different sources. The snakes showed a normal and typical postprandial response. By four hours after feeding, the δ13C-values indicated fuel switching from endogenous to exogenous. From then on, fuel mixing continuously increased until, at 20 h after feeding, 75% of fuel was exogenous. Resource partitioning showed that throughout SDA, the amount of exogenous energy increased to ~60% of SDA, which was equivalent to ~4.5% of the energy contained in a meal."},{"title":"γ-Amino butyric acid (GABA) release in the ciliated protozoon Paramecium occurs by neuronal-like exocytosis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1251","abstract":"Paramecium primaurelia expresses a significant amount of γ-amino butyric acid (GABA). Paramecia possess both glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-like and vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT)-like proteins, indicating the ability to synthesize GABA from glutamate and to transport GABA into vesicles. Using antibodies raised against mammalian GAD and vGAT, bands with an apparent molecular weight of about 67 kDa and 57 kDa were detected. The presence of these bands indicated a similarity between the proteins in Paramecium and in mammals. VAMP, syntaxin and SNAP, putative proteins of the release machinery that form the so-called SNARE complex, are present in Paramecium. Most VAMP, syntaxin and SNAP fluorescence is localized in spots that vary in size and density and are primarily distributed near the plasma membrane. Antibodies raised against mammal VAMP-3, sintaxin-1 or SNAP-25 revealed protein immunoblot bands having molecular weights consistent with those observed in mammals. Moreover, P. primaurelia spontaneously releases GABA into the environment, and this neurotransmitter release significantly increases after membrane depolarization. The depolarization-induced GABA release was strongly reduced not only in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ but also by pre-incubation with bafilomycin A1 or with botulinum toxin C1 serotype. It can be concluded that GABA occurs in Paramecium, where it is probably stored in vesicles capable of fusion with the cell membrane; accordingly, GABA can be released from Paramecium by stimulus-induced, neuronal-like exocytotic mechanisms."},{"title":"In vivo mechanical response of human Achilles tendon to a single bout of hopping exercise","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1259","abstract":"Stiffness of the human Achilles tendon (AT) was determined in vivo before and after a single bout of hopping exercise. It was hypothesized, based on published data using in vitro specimens, that a reduction in AT stiffness may occur after just 1000 loading cycles at physiological stress levels. Ten healthy subjects performed two-legged hopping exercise consisting of 1150–2600 high impacts. Tendon stiffness was determined in several isometric ramp contractions [20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)] during which tendon elongation was measured using ultrasonography and two cameras. Tendon force was calculated by dividing measured ankle torque by magnetic resonance imaging-derived AT lever arm length. Tendon stiffness remained unchanged, being 430±200 N mm−1 before and 390±190 N mm−1 after the exercise [not significant (n.s.)]. Despite the lack of changes in stiffness, maximum tendon force during MVC was reduced from 3.5±0.6 kN to 2.8±0.7 kN (P<0.01). As the proposed decline in stiffness was not observed, it is concluded that mechanical fatigue did not take place in the AT of healthy individuals after a single bout of high-impact exercise performed until exhaustion."},{"title":"Male moths bearing transplanted female antennae express characteristically female behaviour and central neural activity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1272","abstract":"The primary olfactory centres of the sphinx moth Manduca sexta, the antennal lobes, contain a small number of sexually dimorphic glomeruli: the male-specific macroglomerular complex and the large female glomeruli. These glomeruli play important roles in sex-specific behaviours, such as the location of conspecific females and the selection of appropriate host plants for oviposition. The development of sexually dimorphic glomeruli depends strictly on the ingrowth of sex-specific olfactory receptor cell afferents. In the present study we tested the role of female-specific olfactory receptor cells (ORCs) in mediating female-specific host plant approach behaviour and in determining the response of downstream antennal lobe neurons. We generated male gynandromorphs by excising one imaginal disc from a male larva and replacing it with the antennal imaginal disc from a female donor. Most male gynandromorphs had an apparently normal female antenna and a feminised antennal lobe. These gynandromorphs were tested for flight responses in a wind tunnel towards tomato plants, a preferred host plant for oviposition in M. sexta. Male gynandromorphs landed on host plants as often as normal females, demonstrating that the presence of the induced female-specific glomeruli was necessary and sufficient to produce female-like, odour-oriented behaviour, i.e. orientation towards host plants. We also characterised the physiological and morphological properties of antennal lobe neurons of male gynandromorphs. We found that projection neurons with arborisations in the induced female-specific glomeruli showed physiological responses akin to those of female-specific projection neurons in normal females. These results therefore indicate that ORCs confer specific odour tuning to their glomerular targets and, furthermore, instruct odour-specific behaviour."},{"title":"Morphology–flow interactions lead to stage-selective vertical transport of larval sand dollars in shear flow","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1281","abstract":"Many larvae and other plankton have complex and variable morphologies of unknown functional significance. We experimentally and theoretically investigated the functional consequences of the complex morphologies of larval sand dollars, Dendraster excentricus (Eschscholtz), for hydrodynamic interactions between swimming and turbulent water motion. Vertical shearing flows (horizontal gradients of vertical flow) tilt organisms with simple geometries (e.g. spheres, ellipsoids), causing these organisms to move horizontally towards downwelling water and compromising their abilities to swim upwards. A biomechanical model of corresponding hydrodynamic interactions between turbulence-induced shear and the morphologically complex four-, six- and eight-armed stages of sand dollar larvae suggests that the movements of larval morphologies differ quantitatively and qualitatively across stages and shear intensities: at shear levels typical of calm conditions in estuarine and coastal environments, all modeled larval stages moved upward. However, at higher shears, modeled four- and eight-armed larvae moved towards downwelling, whereas six-armed larvae moved towards upwelling. We also experimentally quantified larval movement by tracking larvae swimming in low-intensity shear while simultaneously mapping the surrounding flow fields. Four- and eight-armed larvae moved into downwelling water, but six-armed larvae did not. Both the model and experiments suggest that stage-dependent changes to larval morphology lead to differences in larval movement: four- and eight-armed stages are more prone than the six-armed stage to moving into downwelling water. Our results suggest a mechanism by which differences can arise in the vertical distribution among larval stages. The ability to mitigate or exploit hydrodynamic interactions with shear is a functional consequence that potentially shapes larval evolution and development."},{"title":"Life in acid: interactive effects of pH and natural organic acids on growth, development and locomotor performance of larval striped marsh frogs (Limnodynastes peronii)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1293","abstract":"The low pH of naturally acidic aquatic environments is the result of soft-water with low buffering capacity and high concentrations of natural organic acids. Our current understanding of the influence of pH on aquatic organisms is largely limited to laboratory studies conducted under controlled conditions with little incorporation of these organic acids. Recent studies suggest natural organic acids may influence the physiology of aquatic species independent of low pH. We examined the effects of pH and varying concentrations of natural wallum water, which is high in organic acids on the hatching success, growth and locomotor performance of larval striped marsh frogs (Limnodynastes peronii). Based on previous studies, we predicted that the detrimental effects of low pH would be further exacerbated by higher concentrations of naturally occurring organic acids (high concentrations of wallum water). In artificial soft-water, embryos experienced both reduced growth and reduced survival when exposed to low pH. However, greater concentrations of natural organic acids did not exacerbate these effects of low pH on growth and development. Instead, we found some evidence that the natural organic acids within wallum water improved growth and swimming performance across all pH treatments. Using path analyses to investigate the effects of pH and natural organic acid concentration on burst swimming performance, we found performance was directly affected by both body length and organic acid concentration. Our data further highlight our limited understanding of the importance of natural organic acids for aquatic organisms and the need to incorporate greater ecological relevance into these studies."},{"title":"Activity, abundance, distribution and expression of Na+/K+-ATPase in the salt glands of Crocodylus porosus following chronic saltwater acclimation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1301","abstract":"Saltwater crocodiles, Crocodylus porosus, possess lingual salt glands which function to remove excess Na+ and Cl− accumulated as a consequence of living in salt water. Little is known about the nature of ion transport systems in C. porosus salt glands and how these systems respond to an osmotic challenge. In the present study, we examined the distribution and regulation of the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) pump, specifically the α-(catalytic) subunit in the salt glands of C. porosus chronically acclimated (6 months) to freshwater (FW) or 70% seawater (SW). We hypothesised that in the SW-acclimated C. porosus there would be an up-regulation of the abundance, activity and gene expression of the NKA transporter. NKA was immunolocalised to the lateral and basal membrane of secretory cells. As predicted, the NKA α-subunit was 2-fold more abundant in SW-acclimated C. porosus salt glands. NKA gene expression was also elevated in the salt glands of SW- vs FW-acclimated crocodiles. There was no increase in the specific activity of NKA in SW-acclimated animals and the in vitro rate of oxygen consumption by salt gland slices from SW-acclimated animals was not significantly different from that of FW-acclimated animals. The proportion of tissue oxygen consumption rate attributable to NKA activity was not different between SW- and FW-acclimated animals (approximately 50%). These data suggest that either chronic SW acclimation does not affect NKA in crocodile salt glands in the same manner as seen in other models or crocodiles possess the capacity to moderate NKA activity following prolonged exposure to SW."},{"title":"Slippery surfaces of pitcher plants: Nepenthes wax crystals minimize insect attachment via microscopic surface roughness","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1115","abstract":"Pitcher plants of the genus Nepenthes efficiently trap and retain insect prey in highly specialized leaves. Besides a slippery peristome which inhibits adhesion of insects they employ epicuticular wax crystals on the inner walls of the conductive zone of the pitchers to hamper insect attachment by adhesive devices. It has been proposed that the detachment of individual crystals and the resulting contamination of adhesive organs is responsible for capturing insects. However, our results provide evidence in favour of a different mechanism, mainly based on the stability and the roughness of the waxy surface. First, we were unable to detect a large quantity of crystal fragments on the pads of insects detached from mature pitcher surfaces of Nepenthes alata. Second, investigation of the pitcher surface by focused ion beam treatment showed that the wax crystals form a compact 3D structure. Third, atomic force microscopy of the platelet-shaped crystals revealed that the crystals are mechanically stable, rendering crystal detachment by insect pads unlikely. Fourth, the surface profile parameters of the wax layer showed striking similarities to those of polishing paper with low grain size. By measuring friction forces of insects on this artificial surface we demonstrate that microscopic roughness alone is sufficient to minimize insect attachment. A theoretical model shows that surface roughness within a certain length scale will prevent adhesion by being too rough for adhesive pads but not rough enough for claws."},{"title":"Hydrodynamic sensing does not facilitate active drag reduction in the golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/8/1309","abstract":"The lateral line system detects water flow, which allows fish to orient their swimming with respect to hydrodynamic cues. However, it is unclear whether this sense plays a role in the control of propulsion. Hydrodynamic theory suggests that fish could reduce drag by coordinating the motion of the head relative to detected flow signals. To test this hypothesis, we performed measurements of undulatory kinematics during steady swimming in the golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas) at three speeds (4.5, 11.0 and 22.0 cm s−1). We found that the phase shift between yaw angle and lateral velocity (20.5±13.1 deg., N=5) was significantly greater than the theoretical optimum (0 deg.) and the amplitude of these variables created a hydrodynamic index (H=0.05±0.03, N=6) that was less than an order of magnitude below the theoretical prediction. Furthermore, we repeated these measurements after pharmacologically ablating the lateral line hair cells and found that drag reduction was not adversely influenced by disabling the lateral line system. Therefore, flow sensing does not facilitate active drag reduction. However, we discovered that ablating the lateral line causes the envelope of lateral displacement to nearly double at the envelope's most narrow point for swimming at 4.5 cm s−1. Therefore, fish may use hydrodynamic sensing to modulate the lateral amplitude of slow undulatory swimming, which could allow rapid responses to changes in environmental flow."},{"title":"Evaluation of the different forces brought into play during tube foot activities in sea stars","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1162","abstract":"Sea star tube feet consist of an enlarged and flattened distal extremity (the disc), which makes contact with the substratum, and a proximal contractile cylinder (the stem), which acts as a tether. In this study, the different forces brought into play during tube foot functioning were investigated in two related species. The tube feet of Asterias rubens and Marthasterias glacialis attach to glass with a similar mean tenacity (0.24 and 0.43 MPa, respectively), corresponding to an estimated maximal attachment force of 0.15 and 0.35 N. The contraction force of their retractor muscle averages 0.017 N. The variation of the retractor muscle contraction with its extension ratio follows a typical bell-shaped length–tension curve in which a maximal contraction of approximately 0.04 N is obtained for an extension ratio of approximately 2.3 in both sea star species. The tensile strength of the tube foot stem was investigated considering the two tissues that could assume a load-bearing function, i.e. the retractor muscle and the connective tissue. The latter is a mutable collagenous tissue presenting a fivefold difference in tensile strength between its soft and stiff state. In our experiments, stiffening was induced by disrupting cell membranes or by modifying the ionic composition of the bathing solution. Finally, the force needed to break the tube foot retractor muscle was found to account for 18–25% of the tube foot total breaking force, showing that, although the connective tissue is the tissue layer that supports most of the load exerted on the stem, the contribution of the retractor muscle cannot be neglected in sea stars. All these forces appear well-balanced for proper functioning of the tube feet during the activities of the sea star. They are discussed in the context of two essential activities: the opening of bivalve shells and the maintenance of position in exposed habitats."},{"title":"Silencing of three Amblyomma americanum (L.) insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related proteins prevents ticks from feeding to repletion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1153","abstract":"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (IGFBP) family is the regulatory arm of the IGF signaling system that control mitogenic and anabolic actions of IGF peptide hormones.

The three molecules here provisionally identified as AamIGFBP-rP1 and short (S) and long (L) AamIGFBP-rP6 are expressed in multiple tick organs and are responsive to tick feeding activity with the former being upregulated and the latter being downregulated. We show that they regulate tick physiological functions that may be related to A. americanum tick feeding success as revealed by RNAi-mediated dual silencing of AamIGFBP-rP6S and AamIGFBP-rP6L or AamIGFBP-rP1 alone, which caused a reduction in blood meal size compared to the controls. Additionally, in the case of AamIGFBP-rP1 silencing, 47% of ticks died while attempting to feed and those that did survive and spontaneously detached from the host failed to lay eggs. Although AamIGFBP-rP6S and AamIGFBP-rP6L show overall identities of 49% and 59%, respectively, to Rhipicephalus microplus C protein, the identity level jumps to ~84% when the comparison is restricted to first 70 amino acids of the mature protein. Similarly, the AamIGFBP-rP1 mature protein is ~72%, 87%, 88% and 92% identical to that of Ixodes scapularis S, R. microplus, R. appendiculatus N and A. variegatum F, respectively. The observed across-tick-species conservation suggests that the three molecules (AamIGFBP-rP1, AamIGFBP-rP6S and AamIGFBP-rP6L) represent target for development of vaccines to protect animals against multiple tick species.

We used in vivo voltammetry to measure extracellular 5-HT in the IC of behaving mice to address this issue. Extracellular 5-HT increased with the recovery from anesthesia, suggesting that the neuromodulation of auditory processing is correlated with the level of behavioral arousal. Awake mice were further exposed to auditory (broadband noise), visual (light) or olfactory (2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline, TMT) stimuli, presented with food or confined in a small arena. Only the auditory stimulus or restricted movement increased the concentration of extracellular 5-HT in the IC. Changes occurred within minutes of stimulus onset, with the auditory stimulus increasing extracellular 5-HT by an average of 5% and restricted movement increasing it by an average of 14%. These findings suggest that the neuromodulation of auditory processing by 5-HT is a dynamic process that is dependent on internal state and behavioral conditions."},{"title":"Heating rate and symbiont productivity are key factors determining thermal stress in the reef-building coral Acropora formosa","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1026","abstract":"The onset of large-scale coral bleaching events is routinely estimated on the basis of the duration and intensity of thermal anomalies determined as degree heating weeks. Degree heating weeks, however, do not account for differential rates of heating. This study aimed to explore the relationship between different rates of heating above the documented regional winter threshold, and resultant bleaching of the reef-building coral Acropora formosa. Under a relatively low light field, rapid heating of 1°C day−1 from 29°C to 32°C lead to a 17.6% decline in Fv/Fm, concurrent with a rapid increase in xanthophyll de-epoxidation sustained into the dark, whereas slower heating rates of 0.5°C day−1 lead to no decline in Fv/Fm and no change in dark-adapted xanthophyll cycling. At the winter bleaching threshold of 30°C, areal net O2 evolution exceeded the control values for rapidly heated corals, but was lower than the controls for slowly heated corals. At the maximum temperature of 33°C, however, both treatments had net O2 fluxes that were 50% of control values. At 30°C, only symbiont densities in the slowly heated controls were reduced relative to controls values. By 33°C, however, symbiont densities were 55% less than the controls in both treatments. The rate of heat accumulation was found to be an important variable, with rapidly heated corals attaining the same bleaching status and loss of areal O2 production for half the degree heating week exposure as slowly heated corals. The study revealed that it is incorrect to assume that significant dark acclimation disables non-photochemical quenching, because 75% of an increased xanthophyll pool was found to be in the de-epoxidated state following rapid heat accumulation. This has important ramifications for the interpretation of chlorophyll fluorescence data such as dark adapted Fv/Fm."},{"title":"Genotype by temperature interactions in the metabolic rate of the Glanville fritillary butterfly","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1042","abstract":"Metabolic rate is a highly plastic trait.

Body mass and temperature had consistent positive effects on metabolic rate in pupae and resting adults but not in flying adults. There was also a consistent nonlinear effect of the time of the day, which was strongest in pupae and weakest in flying adults. Flight metabolic rate was strongly affected by an interaction between the phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) genotype and temperature. Over a broad range of measurement temperatures, heterozygous individuals at a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Pgi had higher peak metabolic rate in flight, but at high temperatures homozygous individuals performed better. The two genotypes did not differ in resting metabolic rate, suggesting that the heterozygotes do not pay an additional energetic cost for their higher flight capacity. Mass-independent resting and flight metabolic rates were at best weakly correlated at the individual level, and therefore, unlike in many vertebrates, resting metabolic rate does not serve as a useful surrogate of the metabolic capacity of this butterfly."},{"title":"Video playback demonstrates episodic personality in the gloomy octopus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1035","abstract":"Coleoid cephalopods, including octopuses, cuttlefish and squid, rely mainly on visual signals when interacting with conspecifics, predators and prey. Presenting visual stimuli, such as models, photographs, mirrors and live conspecifics, can thus provide insight into cephalopod behaviour. These methods, however, have limitations – mirrors and live animals lack experimental control, whereas models and photographs sacrifice motion-based information. Video playback addresses these issues by presenting controlled, moving and realistic stimuli but, to date, video playback has not been used successfully with any cephalopod. Here, we developed a video playback technique for the gloomy octopus (Octopus tetricus) that incorporated recent advances in video technology. We then used this technique to test for personality, which we defined as behavioural differences between individuals that are consistent over time and across ecologically important contexts. We captured wild octopuses and tested them on 3 separate days over a 10 day period. On each test day, subjects were presented with videos of a food item, a novel object and a conspecific. These represented a foraging, novel and threatening context, respectively. A fourth video without a moving stimulus controlled for the playback monitor itself and potential artifacts associated with video playback. Experimental stimuli evoked unambiguous and biologically appropriate responses from the subjects. Furthermore, individuals' responses to the three experimental contexts were highly correlated within a given test day. However, within a given context, individuals behaved inconsistently across the 3 test days. The reordering of ranks suggests that rather than fulfilling the criteria for personality, gloomy octopus show temporal discontinuities, and hence display episodic personality."},{"title":"Influence of wing loading on the trade-off between pursuit-diving and flight in common guillemots and razorbills","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1018","abstract":"Species of bird that use their wings for underwater propulsion are thought to face evolutionary trade-offs between flight and diving, leading to the prediction that species with different wing areas relative to body mass (i.e. different wing loadings) also differ in the relative importance of flight and diving activity during foraging trips. We tested this hypothesis for two similarly sized species of Alcidae (common guillemots and razorbills) by using bird-borne devices to examine three-dimensional foraging behaviour at a single colony. Guillemots have 30% higher wing loading than razorbills and, in keeping with this difference, razorbills spent twice as long in flight as a proportion of trip duration whereas guillemots spent twice as long in diving activity. Razorbills made a large number of short, relatively shallow dives and spent little time in the bottom phase of the dive whereas guillemots made fewer dives but frequently attained depths suggesting that they were near the seabed (ca. 35–70 m). The bottom phase of dives by guillemots was relatively long, indicating that they spent considerable time searching for and pursuing prey. Guillemots also spent a greater proportion of each dive bout underwater and had faster rates of descent, indicating that they were more adept at maximising time for pursuit and capture of prey. These differences in foraging behaviour may partly reflect guillemots feeding their chicks single large prey obtained near the bottom and razorbills feeding their chicks multiple prey from the water column. Nonetheless, our data support the notion that interspecific differences in wing loadings of auks reflect an evolutionary trade-off between aerial and underwater locomotion."},{"title":"Neuromechanical simulation of the locust jump","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1060","abstract":"The neural circuitry and biomechanics of kicking in locusts have been studied to understand their roles in the control of both kicking and jumping. It has been hypothesized that the same neural circuit and biomechanics governed both behaviors but this hypothesis was not testable with current technology. We built a neuromechanical model to test this and to gain a better understanding of the role of the semi-lunar process (SLP) in jump dynamics. The jumping and kicking behaviors of the model were tested by comparing them with a variety of published data, and were found to reproduce the results from live animals. This confirmed that the kick neural circuitry can produce the jump behavior. The SLP is a set of highly sclerotized bands of cuticle that can be bent to store energy for use during kicking and jumping. It has not been possible to directly test the effects of the SLP on jump performance because it is an integral part of the joint, and attempts to remove its influence prevent the locust from being able to jump. Simulations demonstrated that the SLP can significantly increase jump distance, power, total energy and duration of the jump impulse. In addition, the geometry of the joint enables the SLP force to assist leg flexion when the leg is flexed, and to assist extension once the leg has begun to extend."},{"title":"Functional characterization of Rhesus glycoproteins from an ammoniotelic teleost, the rainbow trout, using oocyte expression and SIET analysis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1049","abstract":"Recent experimental evidence from rainbow trout suggests that gill ammonia transport may be mediated in part via Rhesus (Rh) glycoproteins. In this study we analyzed the transport properties of trout Rh proteins (Rhag, Rhbg1, Rhbg2, Rhcg1, Rhcg2, Rh30-like) expressed in Xenopus oocytes, using the radiolabeled ammonia analogue [14C]methylamine, and the scanning ion electrode technique (SIET). All of the trout Rh proteins, except Rh30-like, facilitated methylamine uptake. Uptake was saturable, with Km values ranging from 4.6 to 8.9 mmol l−1. Raising external pH from 7.5 to 8.5 resulted in 3- to 4-fold elevations in Jmax values for methylamine; Km values were unchanged when expressed as total or protonated methylamine. Efflux of methylamine was also facilitated in Rh-expressing oocytes. Efflux and influx rates were stimulated by a pH gradient, with higher rates observed with steeper H+ gradients. NH4Cl inhibited methylamine uptake in oocytes expressing Rhbg1 or Rhcg2. When external pH was elevated from 7.5 to 8.5, the Ki for ammonia against methylamine transport was 35–40% lower when expressed as total ammonia or NH4+, but 5- to 6-fold higher when expressed as NH3. With SIET we confirmed that ammonia uptake was facilitated by Rhag and Rhcg2, but not Rh30-like proteins. Ammonia uptake was saturable, with a comparable Jmax but lower Km value than for total or protonated methylamine. At low substrate concentrations, the ammonia uptake rate was greater than that of methylamine. The Km for total ammonia (560 μmol l−1) lies within the physiological range for trout. The results are consistent with a model whereby NH4+ initially binds, but NH3 passes through the Rh channels. We propose that Rh glycoproteins in the trout gill are low affinity, high capacity ammonia transporters that exploit the favorable pH gradient formed by the acidified gill boundary layer in order to facilitate rapid ammonia efflux when plasma ammonia concentrations are elevated."},{"title":"Functional study of the pectoral spine stridulation mechanism in different mochokid catfishes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1107","abstract":"Mochokidae are able to produce pectoral spine stridulation sounds. During sound production, high speed videos were used to study the pectoral fin movements to identify the mechanisms involved. A call consisted of a series of pulses and occurred during a spine sweep, which was in fact made up of a series of jerky movements. The morphology of the pectoral spines and associated muscles was also observed in different species. The contractions of adductor profundus and superficial adductor allows adduction and abduction movements (sweep) of the spine, respectively. Simultaneously, the contraction of the arrector ventralis or the arrector 3 of the pectoral spine allows the pulling and pressing the ridges of the dorsal process, against the rough lateral face of the spinal fossa. This results in the rubbing of the ridges of the dorsal process, producing sounds. In Synodontis the analogy for sound production would be a brake shoe pressing against a wheel."},{"title":"Fibre architecture and song activation rates of syringeal muscles are not lateralized in the European starling","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1069","abstract":"The songbird vocal organ, the syrinx, is composed of two sound generators, which are independently controlled by sets of two extrinsic and four intrinsic muscles. These muscles rank among the fastest vertebrate muscles, but the molecular and morphological foundations of this rapid physiological performance are unknown. Here we show that the four intrinsic muscles in the syrinx of male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) are composed of fast oxidative and superfast fibres. Dorsal and ventral tracheobronchialis muscles contain slightly more superfast fibres relative to the number of fast oxidative fibres than dorsal and ventral syringealis muscles. This morphological difference is not reflected in the highest, burst-like activation rate of the two muscle groups during song as assessed with electromyographic recordings. No difference in fibre type ratio was found between the corresponding muscles of the left and right sound generators. Airflow and electromyographic measurements during song indicate that maximal activation rate and speed of airflow regulation do not differ between the two sound sources. Whereas the potential for high-speed muscular control exists on both sides, the two sound generators are used differentially for modulation of acoustic parameters. These results show that large numbers of superfast fibre types are present in intrinsic syringeal muscles of a songbird, providing further confirmation of rapid contraction kinetics. However, syringeal muscles are composed of two fibre types which raises questions about the neuromuscular control of this heterogeneous muscle architecture."},{"title":"The ontogeny of muscle structure and locomotory function in the long-finned squid Doryteuthis pealeii","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1079","abstract":"Understanding the extent to which changes in muscle form and function underlie ontogenetic changes in locomotory behaviors and performance is important in understanding the evolution of musculoskeletal systems and also the ecology of different life stages. We explored ontogenetic changes in the structure, myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression and contractile properties of the circular muscles that provide power for jet locomotion in the long-finned squid Doryteuthis pealeii. The circular muscle fibers of newly hatched paralarvae had different sizes, shapes, thick filament lengths, thin:thick filament ratio, myofilament organization and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) distribution than those of adults. Viewed in cross section, most circular muscle cells were roughly triangular or ovoid in shape with a core of mitochondria; however, numerous muscle cells with crescent or other unusual cross-sectional shapes and muscle cells with unequal distributions of mitochondria were present in the paralarvae. The frequency of these muscle cells relative to ‘normal’ circular muscle cells ranged from 1:6 to 1:10 among the 19 paralarvae we surveyed. The thick filaments of the two types of circular fibers, superficial mitochondria-rich (SMR) and central mitochondria-poor (CMP), differed slightly in length among paralarvae with thick filament lengths of 0.83±0.15 μm and 0.71±0.1 μm for the SMR and CMP fibers, respectively (P 0.05; ANOVA). During ontogeny the thick filament lengths of both the CMP and SMR fibers increased significantly to 1.78±0.27 μm and 3.12±0.56 μm, respectively, in adults (P<0.0001 for both comparisons; ANOVA with Tukey's highly significant difference post hoc tests). When sectioned parallel to their long axes, the SMR and CMP fibers of both paralarvae and adults exhibited the myofilament arrangements typical of obliquely striated muscle cells but the angle of obliquity of the dense bodies was 22.8±2.4 deg. and 4.6±0.87 deg. for paralarvae and adults, respectively. There were also differences in the distribution of the anastomosing network of SR. In paralarvae, the outer and central zones of SR were well developed but the intramyoplasmic zone was greatly reduced in some cells or was scattered non-uniformly across the myoplasm. Whereas in adults the intramyoplasmic SR region was composed primarily of flattened tubules, it was composed primarily of rounded vesicles or tubules when present in the paralarvae. The ontogenetic differences in circular muscle structure were correlated with significant differences in their contractile properties. In brief tetanus at 20°C, the mean unloaded shortening velocity of the paralarval circular muscle preparations was 9.1 L0 s−1 (where L0 was the preparation length that generated the peak isometric stress), nearly twice that measured in other studies for the CMP fibers of adults. The mean peak isometric stress was 119±15 mN mm−2 physiological cross section, nearly half that measured for the CMP fibers of adults. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of paralarval and adult mantle samples revealed very similar expression patterns of the two known isoforms of squid MHC. The ontogenetic differences in the structure and physiology of the circular muscles may result in more rapid mantle movements during locomotion. This prediction is consistent with jet pulse durations observed in other studies, with shorter jet pulses providing hydrodynamic advantages for paralarvae."},{"title":"Mating-induced transient inhibition of responses to sex pheromone in a male moth is not mediated by octopamine or serotonin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1100","abstract":"In the male moth, Agrotis ipsilon, mating induces a transient inhibition of behavioural and central nervous responses to sex pheromone. Newly mated males are not attracted to sex pheromone, and the sensitivity of their antennal lobe (AL) neurons is lower than in virgin males. This rapid transient olfactory inhibition prevents them from re-mating unsuccessfully until they have refilled their sex glands. We hypothesized that this olfactory ‘switch off’ might be controlled by neuromodulators such as biogenic amines. To test our hypothesis, we studied the effects of octopamine (OA) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) on the coding properties of pheromone-sensitive AL neurons in virgin and newly mated males. We show that AL neuron sensitivity increased in newly mated males after injection of OA or 5-HT, but only OA treatment affected certain response characteristics of AL neurons in virgin males. Whereas all measured AL neuron response characteristics were different between virgin and newly mated males, amine treatment in newly mated males restored only the latency and spike frequency, but not the duration of excitatory and inhibitory phases, which were initially found in virgin males. Additionally, we investigated the behavioural effects of OA and 5-HT treatments in virgin and mated males. Although OA and 5-HT enhanced the general flight activity of newly mated males, amine treatments did not restore the behavioural pheromone response of mated moths. Altogether, these results show that, although biogenic amines modulate the olfactory system in moths, OA and 5-HT are probably not involved in the post-mating inhibition of responses to sex pheromone in A. ipsilon males."},{"title":"Stabilization and swelling of hagfish slime mucin vesicles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1092","abstract":"When agitated, Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) produce large quantities of slime that consists of hydrated bundles of protein filaments and membrane-bound mucin vesicles from numerous slime glands. When the slime exudate contacts seawater, the thread bundles unravel and the mucin vesicles swell and rupture. Little is known about the mechanisms of vesicle rupture in seawater and stabilization within the gland, although it is believed that the vesicle membrane is permeable to most ions except polyvalent anions. We hypothesized that the most abundant compounds within the slime gland exudate have a stabilizing effect on the mucin vesicles. To test this hypothesis, we measured the chemical composition of the fluid component of hagfish slime exudate and conducted functional assays with these solutes to test their ability to keep the vesicles in a condensed state. We found K+ concentrations that were elevated relative to plasma, and Na+, Cl− and Ca2+ concentrations that were considerably lower. Our analysis also revealed high levels of methylamines such as trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), betaine and dimethylglycine, which had a combined concentration of 388 mmol l−1 in the glandular fluid. In vitro rupture assays demonstrated that both TMAO and betaine had a significant effect on rupture, but neither was capable of completely abolishing mucin swelling and rupture, even at high concentrations. This suggests that some other mechanism such as the chemical microenvironment within gland mucous cells, or hydrostatic pressure is responsible for stabilization of the vesicles within the gland."},{"title":"Adenosinergic modulation of neuronal activity in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1126","abstract":"Adenosine has been termed a retaliatory metabolite and its neuroprotective effects have been implicated in the hypoxia tolerance of several species; however, its role in the invertebrate CNS remains unclear. To determine if adenosine modulates neuronal activity in invertebrate neurons, we conducted whole-cell recordings from neurons in the central ring ganglia of the anoxia-tolerant pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis during exposure to adenosine and pharmacological compounds known to modulate the type I subclass of adenosine receptors (A1R). Action potential (AP) frequency and membrane potential (Vm) were unchanged under control conditions, and addition of adenosine decreased AP frequency by 47% (from 1.08±0.22 to 0.57±0.14 Hz) and caused significant hyperpolarization of Vm. The A1R agonist cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) mimicked the results obtained with adenosine whereas antagonism of the A1R with 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) had no effect on AP frequency or Vm but prevented the adenosine and CPA-mediated decreases in neuronal activity. Furthermore, Ca2+ measurements with fluo-4 revealed that A1R activation led to a 12% increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and this elevation was also antagonized by DPCPX. Our results suggest that adenosine acting via the adenosine receptor (type I subclass) depresses neuronal activity in the adult L. stagnalis CNS and this depression is correlated with an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels."},{"title":"The substrate as a skeleton: ground reaction forces from a soft-bodied legged animal","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1133","abstract":"The measurement of forces generated during locomotion is essential for the development of accurate mechanical models of animal movements. However, animals that lack a stiff skeleton tend to dissipate locomotor forces in large tissue deformation and most have complex or poorly defined substrate contacts. Under these conditions, measuring propulsive and supportive forces is very difficult. One group that is an exception to this problem is lepidopteran larvae which, despite lacking a rigid skeleton, have well-developed limbs (the prolegs) that can be used for climbing in complex branched structures and on a variety of surfaces. Caterpillars therefore are excellent for examining the relationship between soft body deformation and substrate reaction forces during locomotion. In this study, we devised a method to measure the ground reaction forces (GRFs) at multiple contact points during crawling by the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta). Most abdominal prolegs bear similar body weight during their stance phase. Interestingly, forward reaction forces did not come from pushing off the substrate. Instead, most positive reaction forces came from anterior abdominal prolegs loaded in tension while posterior legs produced drag in most instances. The counteracting GRFs effectively stretch the animal axially during the second stage of a crawl cycle. These findings help in understanding how a terrestrial soft-bodied animal can interact with its substrate to control deformation without hydraulic actuation. The results also provide insights into the behavioral and mechanistic constraints leading to the evolution of diverse proleg arrangements in different species of caterpillar."},{"title":"The relationship of head movements to semicircular canal size in cetaceans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1175","abstract":"The semicircular canals measure head rotations, providing information critical for maintaining equilibrium. The canals of cetaceans (including whales, dolphins and porpoises) are extraordinarily small, making them unique exceptions to the allometric relationship shared by all other vertebrates between canal size and animal mass. Most modern cetaceans have shorter and less flexible necks than those of their ancestors, an adaptation hypothesized to have led to exaggerated head movements during locomotion. These movements are thought to have necessitated a decrease in the size and sensitivity of the canals, increasing their operating range to accommodate increased head motion. We tested whether the size of the semicircular canals in cetaceans is related to their head movements by comparing the rotational head velocities, frequencies and accelerations of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and a terrestrial relative, cattle (Bos taurus), using an array of three orthogonal head-fixed miniaturized rotational ratemeters. We collected data during typical locomotion (swimming; trotting) and during behaviors with enhanced head movements (rapid spiraling underwater; bucking). Cattle head movements always exceeded those of dolphins. Maximum head velocities were 528 deg. s−1 in dolphins and 534 deg. s−1 in cattle; maximum head frequencies were 2.86 Hz in dolphins and 3.45 Hz in cattle; and maximum head accelerations were 5253 deg. s−2 in dolphins and 10,880 deg. s−2 in cattle. These results indicate that accentuated head movements cannot explain the reduced size and sensitivity of cetacean semicircular canals. The evolutionary cause for their reduced canal size remains uncertain."},{"title":"Physiological mechanisms underlying a trade-off between growth rate and tolerance of feed deprivation in the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1143","abstract":"The specific growth rate (SGR) of a cohort of 2000 tagged juvenile European sea bass was measured in a common tank, during two sequential cycles comprising three-weeks feed deprivation followed by three-weeks ad libitum re-feeding. After correction for initial size at age as fork length, there was a direct correlation between negative SGR (rate of mass loss) during feed deprivation and positive SGR (rate of compensatory growth) during re-feeding (Spearman rank correlation R=0.388, P=0.000002). Following a period of rearing under standard culture conditions, individuals representing ‘high growth’ phenotypes (GP) and ‘high tolerance of feed deprivation’ phenotypes (DP) were selected from either end of the SGR spectrum. Static and swimming respirometry could not demonstrate lower routine or standard metabolic rate in DP to account for greater tolerance of feed deprivation. Increased rates of compensatory growth in GP were not linked to greater maximum metabolic rate, aerobic metabolic scope or maximum cardiac performance than DP. When fed a standard ration, however, GP completed the specific dynamic action (SDA) response significantly faster than DP. Therefore, higher growth rate in GP was linked to greater capacity to process food. There was no difference in SDA coefficient, an indicator of energetic efficiency. The results indicate that individual variation in growth rate in sea bass reflects, in part, a trade-off against tolerance of food deprivation. The two phenotypes represented the opposing ends of a spectrum. The GP aims to exploit available resources and grow as rapidly as possible but at a cost of physiological and/or behavioural attributes, which lead to increased energy dissipation when food is not available. An opposing strategy, exemplified by DP, is less ‘boom and bust’, with a lower physiological capacity to exploit resources but which is less costly to sustain during periods of food deprivation."},{"title":"The scaling of myofibrillar actomyosin ATPase activity in apid bee flight muscle in relation to hovering flight energetics","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1195","abstract":"For all types of locomotion, the overall efficiency with which chemical energy is converted into mechanical work increases with increasing body size. In order to gain insight into the determinants of the scaling of overall efficiency, we measured the scaling of the rate of ATP utilisation during cyclical contractions using glycerinated fibres from the dorsolongitudinal flight muscle of several species of apid bees, covering a ninefold range in body mass. The efficiency of ATP utilisation by the crossbridges is one of the stages that determines the overall efficiency of locomotion. The mechanochemical coefficient was calculated from the ratio of the net power output to the rate of ATP hydrolysis and ranged from 6.5 to 9.7 kJ mol−1 ATP. The corresponding gross myofibrillar efficiency was 15–23%, increasing concomitantly with body mass (Mb) and decreasing with increasing wingbeat frequency (n) and scaling as Mb0.184 and n−1.168 in bumblebees and as Mb0.153 and n−0.482 in euglossine bees. Overall efficiency of hovering in bumblebees and euglossine bees was calculated using previously published metabolic power data and revised estimates of the mechanical power output to take into account the drag due to the leading edge vortex that has not been included in previous models. The scaling of overall efficiency of hovering flight in apid bees was not as pronounced as the scaling of myofibrillar efficiency. Therefore the scaling of myofibrillar efficiency with body mass (or frequency) only explained part of the scaling of overall efficiency, and it is likely that the efficiency of other steps in the transduction of chemical energy into mechanical work (e.g. the efficiency of mitochondrial oxidative recovery) may also scale with body mass."},{"title":"Octopamine promotes rhythmicity but not synchrony in a bilateral pair of bursting motor neurons in the feeding circuit of Aplysia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1182","abstract":"Octopamine-like immunoreactivity was localized to a limited number (<40) of neurons in the Aplysia central nervous system, including three neurons in the paired buccal ganglia (BG) that control feeding movements. Application of octopamine (OA) to the BG circuit produced concentration-dependent (10−8–10−4 mol l−1) modulatory actions on the spontaneous burst activity of the bilaterally paired B67 pharyngeal motor neurons (MNs). OA increased B67's burst duration and the number of impulses per burst. These effects reflected actions of OA on the intrinsic tetrodotoxin-resistant driver potential (DP) that underlies B67 bursting. In addition to its effects on B67's burst parameters, OA also increased the rate and regularity of burst timing. Although the bilaterally paired B67 MNs both exhibited rhythmic bursting in the presence of OA, they did not become synchronized. In this respect, the response to OA differed from that of dopamine, another modulator of the feeding motor network, which produces both rhythmicity and synchrony of bursting in the paired B67 neurons. It is proposed that modulators can regulate burst synchrony of MNs by exerting a dual control over their intrinsic rhythmicity and their reciprocal capacity to generate membrane potential perturbations. In this simple system, dopaminergic and octopaminergic modulation could influence whether pharyngeal contractions occur in a bilaterally synchronous or asynchronous fashion."},{"title":"Collagen type XI α1 may be involved in the structural plasticity of the vertebral column in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/7/1207","abstract":"Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) vertebral bone displays plasticity in structure, osteoid secretion and mineralization in response to photoperiod. Other properties of the vertebral bone, such as mineral content and mechanical strength, are also associated with common malformations in farmed Atlantic salmon. The biological mechanisms that underlie these changes in bone physiology are unknown, and in order to elucidate which factors might be involved in this process, microarray assays were performed on vertebral bone of Atlantic salmon reared under natural or continuous light. Eight genes were upregulated in response to continuous light treatment, whereas only one of them was upregulated in a duplicate experiment. The transcriptionally regulated gene was predicted to code for collagen type XI α1, a protein known to be involved in controlling the diameter of fibrillar collagens in mammals. Furthermore, the gene was highly expressed in the vertebrae, where spatial expression was found in trabecular and compact bone osteoblasts and in the chordoblasts of the notochordal sheath. When we measured the expression level of the gene in the tissue compartments of the vertebrae, the collagen turned out to be 150 and 25 times more highly expressed in the notochord and compact bone respectively, relative to the expression in the trabecular bone. Gene expression was induced in response to continuous light, and reduced in compressed vertebrae. The downregulation in compressed vertebrae was due to reduced expression in the compact bone, while expression in the trabecular bone and the notochord was unaffected. These data support the hypothesis that this gene codes for a presumptive collagen type XI α1, which may be involved in the regulatory pathway leading to structural adaptation of the vertebral architecture."},{"title":"Venom kinematics during prey capture in Conus: the biomechanics of a rapid injection system","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/673","abstract":"Cone snails use an extensile, tubular proboscis as a conduit to deliver a potent cocktail of bioactive venom peptides into their prey. Previous studies have focused mainly on understanding the venom's role in prey capture but successful prey capture requires both rapid physiological and biomechanical mechanisms. Conus catus, a fish-hunting species, uses a high-speed hydraulic mechanism to inject its hollow, spear-like radular tooth into prey. We take an integrated approach to investigating the biomechanics of this process by coupling kinematic studies with morphological analyses. Taking advantage of the opaque venom and translucent proboscis of a mollusc-hunting juvenile cone snail, Conus pennaceus, we have determined that a high-speed prey capture mechanism is not unique to cone species that hunt fish prey. Two morphological structures were found to play crucial roles in this process. A constriction of the lumen near the tip of the proboscis, composed of tall epithelial cells densely packed with microfilaments, impedes forward movement of the radular tooth prior to its propulsion. Proximal to the constriction, a muscular sphincter was found to regulate venom flow and pressurization in the proboscis. In C. pennaceus, the rapid appearance and flushing of venom within the proboscis during prey capture suggests a mechanism involving the delivery of a discrete quantity of venom. The interplay between these elements provides a unique and effective biomechanical injection system for the fast-acting cone snail venom peptides."},{"title":"Chloride channel ClC-3 in gills of the euryhaline teleost, Tetraodon nigroviridis: expression, localization and the possible role of chloride absorption","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/683","abstract":"Previous studies have reported the mechanisms of ion absorption and secretion by diverse membrane transport proteins in gills of various teleostean species. To date, however, the chloride channel expressed in the basolateral membrane of mitochondrion-rich (MR) cells for Cl− uptake in freshwater (FW) fish is still unknown. In this study, the combination of bioinformatics tools [i.e. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, Tetraodon nigroviridis (spotted green pufferfish) genome database (Genoscope), BLAT and BLASTn] were used to identify the gene of ClC-3 (TnClC-3), a member of the CLC chloride channel family in the T. nigroviridis genome. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the gene encoding for the ClC-3 protein was widely expressed in diverse tissues (i.e. gill, kidney, intestine, liver and brain) of FW- and seawater (SW)-acclimated pufferfish. In whole-mount double immunofluorescent staining, branchial ClC-3-like immunoreactive protein was localized to the basolateral membrane of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) immunoreactive cells in both the FW- and SW-acclimated pufferfish. In response to salinity, the levels of transcript of branchial TnClC-3 were similar between FW and SW fish. Moreover, the membrane fraction of ClC-3-like protein in gills was 2.7-fold higher in FW compared with SW pufferfish. To identify whether the expression of branchial ClC-3-like protein specifically responded to lower environmental [Cl−], the pufferfish were acclimated to artificial waters either with a normal (control) or lower Cl− concentration (low-Cl). Immunoblotting of membrane fractions of gill ClC-3-like protein showed the expression was about 4.3-fold higher in pufferfish acclimated to the low-Cl environment than in the control group. Furthermore, branchial ClC-3-like protein was rapidly elevated in response to acute changes of environmental salinity or [Cl−]. Taken together, pufferfish ClC-3-like protein was expressed in the basolateral membrane of gill MR cells, and the protein amounts were stimulated by hyposmotic and low-Cl environments. The enhancement of ClC-3-like protein may trigger the step of basolateral Cl− absorption of the epithelium to carry out iono- and osmoregulatory functions of euryhaline pufferfish gills."},{"title":"The influence of tendon compliance on muscle power output and efficiency during cyclic contractions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/707","abstract":"Muscle power output and efficiency during cyclical contractions are influenced by the timing and duration of stimulation of the muscle and the interaction of the muscle with its mechanical environment. It has been suggested that tendon compliance may reduce the energy required for power production from the muscle by reducing the required shortening of the muscle fibres. Theoretically this may allow the muscle to maintain both high power output and efficiency during cyclical contraction; however, this has yet to be demonstrated experimentally. To investigate how tendon compliance might act to increase muscle power output and/or efficiency, we attached artificial tendons of varying compliance to muscle fibre bundles in vitro and measured power output and mechanical efficiency during stretch—shorten cycles (2 Hz) with a range of stretch amplitudes and stimulation patterns. The results showed that peak power, average power output and efficiency (none of which can have direct contributions from the compliant tendon) all increased with increasing tendon compliance, presumably due to the tendon acting to minimise muscle energy use by allowing the muscle fibres to shorten at optimal speeds. Matching highly compliant tendons with a sufficiently large amplitude length change and appropriate stimulation pattern significantly increased the net muscle efficiency compared with stiff tendons acting at the same frequency. The maximum efficiency for compliant tendons was also similar to the highest value measured under constant velocity and force conditions, which suggests that tendon compliance can maximise muscle efficiency in the conditions tested here. These results provide experimental evidence that during constrained cyclical contractions, muscle power and efficiency can be enhanced with compliant tendons."},{"title":"Biomechanics of locomotion in Asian elephants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/694","abstract":"Elephants are the biggest living terrestrial animal, weighing up to five tons and measuring up to three metres at the withers. These exceptional dimensions provide certain advantages (e.g. the mass-specific energetic cost of locomotion is decreased) but also disadvantages (e.g. forces are proportional to body volume while supportive tissue strength depends on their cross-sectional area, which makes elephants relatively more fragile than smaller animals). In order to understand better how body size affects gait mechanics the movement of the centre of mass (COM) of 34 Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) was studied over their entire speed range of 0.4-5.0 m s−1 with force platforms. The mass-specific mechanical work required to maintain the movements of the COM per unit distance is ~0.2 J kg−1 m−1 (about 1/3 of the average of other animals ranging in size from a 35 g kangaroo rat to a 70 kg human). At low speeds this work is reduced by a pendulum-like exchange between the kinetic and potential energies of the COM, with a maximum energy exchange of ~60% at 1.4 m s−1. At high speeds, elephants use a bouncing mechanism with little exchange between kinetic and potential energies of the COM, although without an aerial phase. Elephants increase speed while reducing the vertical oscillation of the COM from about 3 cm to 1 cm."},{"title":"Mounting a specific immune response increases energy expenditure of the subterranean rodent Ctenomys talarum (tuco-tuco): implications for intraspecific and interspecific variation in immunological traits","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/715","abstract":"It was recently hypothesised that specific induced defences, which require substantial time and resources and are mostly beneficial against repeated infections, are more likely to be favoured in ‘slow-living-pace’ species. Therefore, understanding how different types of immune defences might vary with life history requires knowledge of the costs and benefits of defence components. Studies that have explored the energetic costs of immunity in vertebrates have done so with a focus primarily on birds and less so on mammals, particularly surface-dwelling rodents. In this study, we evaluated whether an experimental induction of the immune system with a non-pathogenic antigen elevates the energetic expenditure of a subterranean rodent: Ctenomys talarum (tuco-tucos). In both seasons studied, a significant increase in oxygen consumption was verified in immune-challenged tuco-tucos injected with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) compared with control animals. The increase in oxygen consumption 10 days after the exposure to SRBC was lower for female tuco-tucos monitored in the breeding season compared with females in the non-breeding season. Interestingly, antibody titres of female tuco-tucos did not decrease during the breeding season. Our results add new insight into the role of other factors such as basal metabolic rate or degree of parasite exposure besides ‘pace of life’ in modulating the interspecific immunological variation observed in natural populations of mammals."},{"title":"Allometry of hummingbird lifting performance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/725","abstract":"Vertical lifting performance in 67 hummingbird species was studied across a 4000 m elevational gradient. We used the technique of asymptotic load-lifting to elicit maximum sustained muscle power output during loaded hovering flight. Our analysis incorporated direct measurements of maximum sustained load and simultaneous wingbeat kinematics, together with aerodynamic estimates of mass-specific mechanical power output, all within a robust phylogenetic framework for the Trochilidae. We evaluated key statistical factors relevant to estimating slopes for allometric relationships by performing analyses with and without phylogenetic information, and incorporating species-specific measurement error. We further examined allometric relationships at different elevations because this gradient represents a natural experiment for studying physical challenges to animal flight mechanics. Maximum lifting capacity (i.e. vertical force production) declined with elevation, but was either isometric or negatively allometric with respect to both body and muscle mass, depending on elevational occurrence of the corresponding taxa. Maximum relative muscle power output exhibited a negative allometry with respect to muscle mass, supporting theoretical predictions from muscle mechanics."},{"title":"Fitness costs may explain the post-colonisation erosion of phenotypic plasticity","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/735","abstract":"Many organisms can adjust their phenotypes to match local environmental conditions via shifts in developmental trajectories, rather than relying on changes in gene frequencies wrought by natural selection. Adaptive developmental plasticity confers obvious benefits in terms of rapid response and higher mean fitness, so why is it not more common? Plausibly, adaptive plasticity also confers a cost; reshaping the phenotype takes time and energy, so that canalised control of trait values enhances fitness if the optimal phenotype remains the same from one generation to the next. Although this idea is central to interpreting the fitness consequences of adaptive plasticity, empirical data on costs of plasticity are scarce. In Australian tiger snakes, larger relative head size enhances maximal ingestible prey size on islands containing large prey. The trait arises via adaptive plasticity in snake populations on newly colonised islands but becomes genetically canalised on islands where snakes have been present for much longer periods. We experimentally manipulated relative head size in captive neonatal snakes to quantify the costs of adaptive plasticity. Although small-headed snakes were able to increase their head sizes when offered large prey, the delay in doing so, and their inability to consume large prey at the outset, significantly reduced their growth rates relative to conspecifics with larger heads at the beginning of the experiment. This study describes a proximate cause to the post-colonisation erosion of developmental plasticity recorded in tiger snake populations."},{"title":"Development of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in cardiac and skeletal muscles from harp and hooded seals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/740","abstract":"In diving animals, skeletal muscle adaptations to extend underwater time despite selective vasoconstriction include elevated myoglobin (Mb) concentrations, high acid buffering ability (β) and high aerobic and anaerobic enzyme activities. However, because cardiac muscle is perfused during dives, it may rely less heavily on Mb, β and anaerobic pathways to support contractile activity. In addition, because cardiac tissue must sustain contractile activity even before birth, it may be more physiologically mature at birth and/or develop faster than skeletal muscles. To test these hypotheses, we measured Mb levels, β and the activities of citrate synthase (CS), β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in cardiac and skeletal muscle samples from 72 harp and hooded seals, ranging in age from fetuses to adults. Results indicate that in adults cardiac muscle had lower Mb levels (14.7%), β (55.5%) and LDH activity (36.2%) but higher CS (459.6%) and HOAD (371.3%) activities (all P<0.05) than skeletal muscle. In addition, while the cardiac muscle of young seals had significantly lower [Mb] (44.7%) β (80.7%) and LDH activity (89.5%) than adults (all P<0.05), it was relatively more mature at birth and weaning than skeletal muscle. These patterns are similar to those in terrestrial species, suggesting that seal hearts do not exhibit unique adaptations to the challenges of an aquatic existence."},{"title":"Gene expression profiling of genetically determined growth variation in bivalve larvae (Crassostrea gigas)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/749","abstract":"Growth rates in animals are governed by a wide range of biological factors, many of which remain poorly understood. To identify the genes that establish growth differences in bivalve larvae, we compared expression patterns in contrasting phenotypes (slow- and fast-growth) that were experimentally produced by genetic crosses of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Based on transcriptomic profiling of 4.5 million cDNA sequence tags, we sequenced and annotated 181 cDNA clones identified by statistical analysis as candidates for differential growth. Significant matches were found in GenBank for 43% of clones (N=78), including 34 known genes. These sequences included genes involved in protein metabolism, energy metabolism and regulation of feeding activity. Ribosomal protein genes were predominant, comprising half of the 34 genes identified. Expression of ribosomal protein genes showed non-additive inheritance — i.e. expression in fast-growing hybrid larvae was different from average levels in inbred larvae from these parental families. The expression profiles of four ribosomal protein genes (RPL18, RPL31, RPL352 and RPS3) were validated by RNA blots using additional, independent crosses from the same families. Expression of RPL35 was monitored throughout early larval development, revealing that these expression patterns were established early in development (in 2-day-old larvae). Our findings (i) provide new insights into the mechanistic bases of growth and highlight genes not previously considered in growth regulation, (ii) support the general conclusion that genes involved in protein metabolism and feeding regulation are key regulators of growth, and (iii) provide a set of candidate biomarkers for predicting differential growth rates during animal development."},{"title":"Changes in rabbit jaw-muscle activity parameters in response to reduced masticatory load","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/775","abstract":"Mechanical food properties influence the neuromuscular activity of jaw-closing muscles during mastication. It is, however, unknown how the activity profiles of the jaw muscles are influenced by long-term alterations in masticatory load. In order to elucidate the effect of reduced masticatory load on the daily habitual activity profiles of three functionally different jaw muscles, the electromyograms of the masseter, temporalis and digastric muscles were recorded telemetrically in 16 male rabbits between seven and 20 weeks of age. Starting at eight weeks of age the experimental animals were fed significantly softer pellets than the control animals. Daily muscle activity was quantified by the relative duration of muscle use (duty time), burst number and burst length in relation to multiple activity levels. The daily duty time and burst number of the masseter muscle were significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group at 5% and 10% of the maximum activity during the two weeks following the change in food hardness. By contrast, altered food hardness did not significantly influence the activity characteristics of the temporalis and digastric muscles. The findings suggest that a reduction in masticatory load decreases the neuromuscular activity of the jaw-closing muscles that are primarily responsible for force generation during mastication. This decrease is most pronounced in the weeks immediately following the change in food hardness and is limited to the activity levels that reflect muscle contractions during chewing. These findings support the conclusion that the masticatory system manifests few diet-specific long-term changes in the activity profiles of jaw muscles."},{"title":"Insect form vision as one potential shaping force of spider web decoration design","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/759","abstract":"Properties of prey sensory systems are important factors shaping the design of signals generated by organisms exploiting them. In this study we assessed how prey sensory preference affected the exploiter signal design by investigating the evolutionary relationship and relative attractiveness of linear and cruciate form web decorations built by Argiope spiders. Because insects have an innate preference for bilaterally symmetrical patterns, we hypothesized that cruciate form decorations were evolved from linear form due to their higher visual attractiveness to insects. We first reconstructed a molecular phylogeny of the Asian members of the genus Argiope using mitochondrial markers to infer the evolutionary relationship of two decoration forms. Results of ancestral character state reconstruction showed that the linear form was ancestral and the cruciate form derived. To evaluate the luring effectiveness of two decoration forms, we performed field experiments in which the number and orientation of decoration bands were manipulated. Decoration bands arranged in a cruciate form were significantly more attractive to insects than those arranged in a linear form, no matter whether they were composed of silks or dummies. Moreover, dummy decoration bands arranged in a cruciate form attracted significantly more insects than those arranged in a vertical/horizontal form. Such results suggest that pollinator insects' innate preference for certain bilateral or radial symmetrical patterns might be one of the driving forces shaping the arrangement pattern of spider web decorations."},{"title":"Dual control of cytosolic metals by lysosomal transporters in lobster hepatopancreas","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/769","abstract":"This study describes the membrane transport mechanisms used by lobster (Homarus americanus) hepatopancreatic epithelial lysosomes to accumulate and sequester heavy metals from the cytosol, and thereby aid in the regulation of these ions entering the animal from dietary constituents. The present investigation extends previous work describing lysosomal metal uptake by cation exchange with protons and suggests that a second, parallel, lysosomal transport process involving metal—thiol conjugates may work in conjunction with the cation antiporter to control cytoplasmic metal concentrations. Transport of 65Zn2+ by lysosomal membrane vesicles (LMV) incubated in 1 mmol l−1 glutathione (GSH) was not significantly different from metal transport in the absence of the tripeptide. However, preloading LMV with 1 mmol l−1 α-ketoglutarate (AKG), and then incubating in a medium containing 1 mmol l−1 GSH, more than doubled metal uptake, compared with vesicles equilibrated with chloride or possessing an outwardly directed chloride gradient. Kinetic analysis of lysosomal 65Zn2+ influx as a function of zinc concentration, in vesicles containing 1 mmol l−1 AKG and incubated in 1 mmol l−1 GSH, revealed the presence of a sigmoidal, low affinity, high capacity carrier process transporting the metal into the organelle. These data indicated the possible presence of an organic anion exchanger in lobster lysosomal membranes. Western blot analysis of LMV with a rabbit anti-rat OAT1 antibody showed the presence of an orthologous OAT1-like protein (approximate molecular mass of 80 kDa) signal from these membranes. These results, and those published previously, suggest the occurrence of two metal transporters on hepatopancreatic membranes, a high affinity, low capacity cation antiporter and a low affinity, high capacity organic anion exchanger. Together these two systems have the potential to regulate cytoplasmic metals over a wide concentration range."},{"title":"Tracking the oxidative kinetics of carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids in the house sparrow using exhaled 13CO2","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/782","abstract":"Clinicians commonly measure the 13CO2 in exhaled breath samples following administration of a metabolic tracer (breath testing) to diagnose certain infections and metabolic disorders. We believe that breath testing can become a powerful tool to investigate novel questions about the influence of ecological and physiological factors on the oxidative fates of exogenous nutrients. Here we examined several predictions regarding the oxidative kinetics of specific carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids in a dietary generalist, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). After administering postprandial birds with 20 mg of one of seven 13C-labeled tracers, we measured rates of 13CO2 production every 15 min over 2 h. We found that sparrows oxidized exogenous amino acids far more rapidly than carbohydrates or fatty acids, and that different tracers belonging to the same class of physiological fuels had unique oxidative kinetics. Glycine had a mean maximum rate of oxidation (2021 nmol min−1) that was significantly higher than that of leucine (351 nmol min−1), supporting our prediction that nonessential amino acids are oxidized more rapidly than essential amino acids. Exogenous glucose and fructose were oxidized to a similar extent (5.9% of dose), but the time required to reach maximum rates of oxidation was longer for fructose. The maximum rates of oxidation were significantly higher when exogenous glucose was administered as an aqueous solution (122 nmol min−1), rather than as an oil suspension (93 nmol min−1), supporting our prediction that exogenous lipids negatively influence rates of exogenous glucose oxidation. Dietary fatty acids had the lowest maximum rates of oxidation (2-6 nmol min−1), and differed significantly in the extent to which each was oxidized, with 0.73%, 0.63% and 0.21% of palmitic, oleic and stearic acid tracers oxidized, respectively."},{"title":"The influence of foot posture on the cost of transport in humans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/790","abstract":"Although humans appear to be specialized for endurance running, the plantigrade posture of our feet, in which the heel contacts the substrate at the beginning of a step, seems incompatible with economical running. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that plantigrade foot posture reduces the energetic cost of transport (COT) during walking in humans. When human subjects walked with their heels slightly elevated in a ‘low-digitigrade’ posture, COT increased by 53% above that of normal plantigrade walking. By contrast, there was no difference in COT when subjects ran with digitigrade versus plantigrade foot posture. Stride frequency increased and stride length decreased when subjects switched to digitigrade walking; however, this change did not influence the COT. Additionally, we found that possible reductions in postural stability appear not to have caused the elevated cost of digitigrade walking. Digitigrade walking, however, did (1) increase the external mechanical work performed by the limbs; (2) reduce the pendular exchange of kinetic and potential energy of the center of mass; (3) increase the average ground reaction force moment at the ankle joint; and (4) increase the recruitment of major extensor muscles of the ankle, knee, hip and back. These observations suggest that plantigrade foot posture improves the economy of walking. Relative to other mammals, humans are economical walkers, but not economical runners. Given the great distances hunter-gatherers travel, it is not surprising that humans retained a foot posture, inherited from our more arboreal great ape ancestors, that facilitates economical walking."},{"title":"Low plasticity in digestive physiology constrains feeding ecology in diet specialist, zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/798","abstract":"It can be hypothesized that species with a wide or variable food niche are able to adjust their digestive physiology to current food type. In diet specialists, however, the capacity for such presumably costly plasticity is not necessary and flexibility of digestive physiology should be lower. Recently, we found that ontogenetic changes in the activity of digestive enzymes in house sparrow, a species that gradually consumes more carbohydrates during ontogeny, are strongly modified by diet composition. In the present study we examined digestive flexibility of nestling and adult zebra finches, typical diet specialists that consume only seeds after hatching. Both adult and nestling zebra finches could not thrive on a protein-rich and carbohydrate-free diet that supported normal development of young house sparrows. Mass-specific activity of intestinal carbohydrases (maltase and sucrase) was not elevated by higher diet carbohydrate content in both nestling and adult birds. Mass-specific activity of maltase changed less during ontogenetic development in zebra finch than in house sparrow. We conclude that the digestive physiology of zebra finch is adapted to process carbohydrate-rich food after hatching and is much less flexible than in house sparrow. We hypothesize that this difference might reflect the lack of a diet switch during ontogeny or result from high specialization to a narrow diet niche."},{"title":"Perfusion with cAMP analogue affects pheromone-sensitive trichoid sensilla of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta in a time-dependent manner","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/842","abstract":"Octopamine causes time-dependent disadaptation of pheromone-sensitive olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) of Manduca sexta. Because the majority of insect octopamine receptors are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclases we examined whether cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) mimics octopamine-dependent modulation of pheromone transduction in a time-dependent manner. Long-term tip recordings of single trichoid sensilla of Manduca sexta were performed during three zeitgeber times (ZTs, ZT 0=lights on), while stimulating the sensilla with two doses of the main pheromone component bombykal in a non-adapting protocol. The membrane-permeable cAMP analogue 8bcAMP increased the normalized sensillar potential amplitude in a time- and bombykal dose-dependent way. At the higher bombykal dose only, the applied 8bcAMP antagonized an endogenous decrease in the mean sensillar potential amplitude at ZT 1-4 and ZT 8-11 when ORNs were adapted but not at ZT 22-1, when ORNs were sensitized. In contrast to octopamine, 8bcAMP did not consistently affect the initial pheromone-dependent action potential frequency, the phasic/tonic response pattern, or the time-dependent shift to lower mean action potential frequencies at ZT 8-11. Furthermore, 8bcAMP increased the spontaneous action potential frequency time dependently, but differently from octopamine. In conclusion, our results show that cAMP only partly mimics the octopamine-dependent disadaptation of olfactory receptor neurons during photophase, apparently due to another missing octopamine-dependent synergistic factor such as defined intracellular calcium levels."},{"title":"Effect of acute and chronic hypoxia on the swimming performance, metabolic capacity and cardiac function of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/808","abstract":"Low water oxygen content (hypoxia) is a common feature of many freshwater and marine environments.

Thus, we acclimated adult Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) to either ~8-9 kPa O2 (40-45% air saturation) or ~21 kPa O2 (100% air saturation; normoxia) for 6-12 weeks at 10°C, and subsequently measured metabolic variables [routine oxygen consumption (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/213/5/808/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>), maximum <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/213/5/808/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/>, metabolic scope] and cardiac function (cardiac output, <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/213/5/808/embed/inline-graphic-3.gif\"/>; heart rate, fH; and stroke volume, VS) in these fish during critical swimming speed (Ucrit) tests performed at both levels of water oxygenation. Although surgery (flow probe implantation) reduced the Ucrit of normoxia-acclimated cod by 14% (from 1.74 to 1.50 BL s−1) under normoxic conditions, exposure to acute hypoxia lowered the Ucrit of both groups (surgery and non-surgery) by ~30% (to 1.23 and 1.02 BL s−1, respectively).

This study used electromyography to measure pelvic fin muscle activity and particle imaging velocimetry to quantify flow along the ventral body region to test this hypothesis. Fish swam at slow speeds (0.13-1.36 BL s−1) while being filmed with three high speed cameras. Three-dimensional kinematics were captured for all trials. During EMG trials pelvic fin muscle activity was synchronized to kinematic motion, during particle imaging velocimetry trials, a laser light-sheet was used to visualize the flow surrounding the ventral aspect of the fish. Four main conclusions are reached: first, pelvic fins are actively oscillated during slow-speed swimming; antagonistic abductor and adductor muscles contracted simultaneously, their collective action producing a unique contralateral oscillating behaviour in the fins. Second, pelvic fins slow the flow along the ventral side affecting pitch and yaw instabilities; flow upstream of the pelvic fins is slowed by 0.02 m s−1 and flow downstream of the pelvic fins is slowed by 0.034 m s−1 compared with free stream flow. Third, pelvic fin wake influences anal fin angle of attack; flow angle in the wake of the pelvic fin was 33.84±2.4 deg. (max) and −11.83±11.2 deg. (min) compared with the free stream flow angle of 1.27±0.1 deg.

Efficient adhesion must be retained throughout their lifetime even when pads are exposed to contamination. Many insects groom their adhesive structures, but it is possible that self-cleaning properties also play an important role. We measured attachment forces of insect pads on glass after contamination with microspheres and found that both smooth pads (stick insects: Carausius morosus) and hairy pads (dock beetles: Gastrophysa viridula) exhibit self-cleaning. Contaminated pads recovered high levels of adhesion after only eight simulated steps; this was accompanied by the deposition of spheres. Self-cleaning was strongly enhanced by shear movements, and only beetle pads showed the ability to self-clean during purely perpendicular pull-offs. Hairy pads also self-cleaned more efficiently than smooth pads for both large (45 μm) and small (1 μm) particle sizes. However, the beetles' self-cleaning was not superior to smooth pads when contaminated with 10-μm beads. This limitation of self-cleaning is explained by the coincidence of bead diameter and inter-seta distance, which caused beads to remain trapped in between setae."},{"title":"In situ cardiac function in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua): effects of acute and chronic hypoxia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/820","abstract":"Recent in vivo experiments on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) acclimated to chronic hypoxia (6-12 weeks at 10°C; PwO2 ~8-9 kPa) revealed a considerable decrease in the pumping capacity of the heart.

The model is based on data from isolated lamprey muscle and can predict the forces developed during swimming. The model consists of a set of ordinary differential equations, which are solved numerically. The model's first part is a simplified description of the kinetics of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum and binding to muscle protein filaments, in response to neural activation. The second part is based on A. V. Hill's mechanical model of muscle, consisting of elastic and contractile elements in series, the latter obeying known physiological properties. The parameters of the model are determined by fitting the appropriate mathematical solutions to data recorded from isolated lamprey muscle activated under conditions of constant length or rate of change of length. The model is then used to predict the forces developed under conditions of applied sinusoidal length changes, and the results compared with corresponding data. The most significant advance of this model is the incorporation of work-dependent deactivation, whereby a muscle that has been shortening under load generates less force after the shortening ceases than otherwise expected. In addition, the stiffness in this model is not constant but increases with increasing activation. The model yields a closer prediction to data than has been obtained before, and can thus prove an important component of investigations of the neural—mechanical—environmental interactions that occur during natural movements."},{"title":"Making sense of electrical sense in crayfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/651","abstract":"The five sensory modalities of humans are also found in a wide range of invertebrates. Other vertebrates have evolved additional special senses, such as the magnetic sense, which are also found in some invertebrates. However, there remain a few sensory abilities that curiously appear to be found in either vertebrates or invertebrates, but not both. For example, electrosensitivity — the ability to detect electric fields in water — which should benefit vertebrates and invertebrates alike, is apparently only used by vertebrates. However, recent reports suggest that some invertebrates could have an electric sense. Here we examine that possibility further and demonstrate a behavioural threshold to low-level electrical fields in two freshwater invertebrates. The responses are not low enough for them to detect the Earth's magnetic field as some other electroreceptive species can do, but sufficiently low for them to use in navigation or prey and predator detection. This finding challenges the current view of the sensory world of aquatic invertebrates and has implications for the evolution of this ability."},{"title":"Echolocation call production during aerial and terrestrial locomotion by New Zealand's enigmatic lesser short-tailed bat, Mystacina tuberculata","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/551","abstract":"Linkage of echolocation call production with contraction of flight muscles has been suggested to reduce the energetic cost of flight with echolocation, such that the overall cost is approximately equal to that of flight alone. However, the pattern of call production with limb movement in terrestrially agile bats has never been investigated. We used synchronised high-speed video and audio recordings to determine patterns of association between echolocation call production and limb motion by Mystacina tuberculata Gray 1843 as individuals walked and flew, respectively. Results showed that there was no apparent linkage between call production and limb motion when bats walked. When in flight, two calls were produced per wingbeat, late in the downstroke and early in the upstroke. When bats walked, calls were produced at a higher rate, but at a slightly lower intensity, compared with bats in flight. These results suggest that M. tuberculata do not attempt to reduce the cost of terrestrial locomotion and call production through biomechanical linkage. They also suggest that the pattern of linkage seen when bats are in flight is not universal and that energetic savings cannot necessarily be explained by contraction of muscles associated with the downstroke alone."},{"title":"Structural mechanics of the mosquito heart and its function in bidirectional hemolymph transport","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/541","abstract":"The insect circulatory system transports nutrients, signaling molecules, wastes and immune factors to all areas of the body.

Visual observation showed that the heart of resting mosquitoes contracts at a rate of 1.37 Hz (82 beats per minute) and switches contraction direction, with 72% of contractions occurring in the anterograde direction (toward the head) and 28% of contractions occurring in the retrograde direction (toward the tip of the abdomen). The heart is tethered to the midline of the abdominal tergum by six complete and three incomplete pairs of alary muscles, and propels hemolymph at an average velocity of 8 mm s−1 by sequentially contracting muscle fibers oriented in a helical twist with respect to the lumen of the vessel. Hemolymph enters the heart through six pairs of incurrent abdominal ostia and one pair of ostia located at the thoraco-abdominal junction that receive hemolymph from the abdominal hemocoel and thoracic venous channels, respectively. The vessel expels hemolymph through distal excurrent openings located at the anterior end of the aorta and the posterior end of the heart. In conclusion, this study presents a comprehensive revision and expansion of our knowledge of the mosquito heart and for the first time quantifies hemolymph flow in an insect while observing dorsal vessel contractions."},{"title":"Mounting of erratic histoincompatible responses in hermatypic corals: a multi-year interval comparison","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/535","abstract":"Studies on allorecognition in the phylum Cnidaria have disclosed complex arrays of effector mechanisms, specificity and competency to distinguish precisely between self and non-self attributes, and have revealed the existence of allogeneic maturity. Here we studied allo-responses between young Stylophora pistillata colonies by following 517 allogeneic interactions between naturally settled kin aggregates and by establishing 417 forced allogeneic and autogeneic assays made of solitarily settled spat that were cut into two similar size subclones, of which one had been challenged allogeneically. Fused assays were exposed to a second allorecognition challenge, made of three allogeneic types. Whereas about half of the kin allogeneic interactions led to tissue fusions and chimera formations, none of the 83 non-sibling pair combinations were histocompatible. In contrast to previous results we recorded rejections between siblings at the age of less than two months. More challenging, we documented cases of fusions between interacting siblings at ages older than one-year-old partners, all differing from a previous study made on the same coral population more than a decade ago. Similar erratic histoincompatible responses were recorded in other pocilloporid species. We suggest that these results reflect reduced genetic heterogeneity caused by chronic anthropogenic impacts on shallow water coral populations where planulae originating from the same mother colony or from different mother colonies that are genetically related share increasing parts of their genomes. Offspring born to related parents may also reveal an increase in genomic homozygosity, and altogether impose erratic alloimmunity."},{"title":"Insight of scent: experimental evidence of olfactory capabilities in the wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/558","abstract":"Wandering albatrosses routinely forage over thousands of kilometres of open ocean, but the sensory mechanisms used in the food search itself have not been completely elucidated. Recent telemetry studies show that some spatial behaviours of the species are consistent with the ‘multimodal foraging strategy’ hypothesis which proposes that birds use a combination of olfactory and visual cues while foraging at sea. The ‘multimodal foraging strategy’ hypothesis, however, still suffers from a lack of experimental evidence, particularly regarding the olfactory capabilities of wandering albatrosses. As an initial step to test the hypothesis, we carried out behavioural experiments exploring the sensory capabilities of adult wandering albatrosses at a breeding colony. Three two-choice tests were designed to investigate the birds' response to olfactory and visual stimuli, individually or in combination. Perception of the different stimuli was assessed by comparing the amount of exploration directed towards an ‘experimental’ display or a ‘control’ display. Our results indicate that birds were able to perceive the three types of stimulus presented: olfactory, visual and combined. Moreover, olfactory and visual cues were found to have additional effects on the exploratory behaviours of males. This simple experimental demonstration of reasonable olfactory capabilities in the wandering albatross supports the ‘multimodal foraging strategy’ and is consistent with recent hypotheses of the evolutionary history of procellariiforms."},{"title":"Can red flowers be conspicuous to bees? Bombus dahlbomii and South American temperate forest flowers as a case in point","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/564","abstract":"It has been argued that trichromatic bees with photoreceptor spectral sensitivity peaks in the ultraviolet (UV), blue and green areas of the spectrum are blind to long wavelengths (red to humans). South American temperate forests (SATF) contain a large number of human red-looking flowers that are reported to be visited by the bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii. In the present study, B. dahlbomii's spectral sensitivity was measured through electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. No extended sensitivity to long wavelengths was found in B. dahlbomii. The spectral reflectance curves from eight plant species with red flowers were measured. The color loci occupied by these flowers in the bee color space was evaluated using the receptor noise-limited model. Four of the plant species have pure red flowers with low levels of chromatic contrast but high levels of negative L-receptor contrast. Finally, training experiments were performed in order to assess the role of achromatic cues in the detection and discrimination of red targets by B. dahlbomii. The results of the training experiments suggest that the bumblebee relies on achromatic contrast provided by the L-receptor to detect and discriminate red targets. These findings are discussed in the context of the evolutionary background under which the relationship between SATF species and their flower visitors may have evolved."},{"title":"Chewing variation in lepidosaurs and primates","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/572","abstract":"Mammals chew more rhythmically than lepidosaurs. The research presented here evaluated possible reasons for this difference in relation to differences between lepidosaurs and mammals in sensorimotor systems. Variance in the absolute and relative durations of the phases of the gape cycle was calculated from kinematic data from four species of primates and eight species of lepidosaurs. The primates exhibit less variance in the duration of the gape cycle than in the durations of the four phases making up the gape cycle. This suggests that increases in the durations of some gape cycle phases are accompanied by decreases in others. Similar effects are much less pronounced in the lepidosaurs. In addition, the primates show isometric changes in gape cycle phase durations, i.e. the relative durations of the phases of the gape cycle change little with increasing cycle time. In contrast, in the lepidosaurs variance in total gape cycle duration is associated with increases in the proportion of the cycle made up by the slow open phase. We hypothesize that in mammals the central nervous system includes a representation of the optimal chew cycle duration maintained using afferent feedback about the ongoing state of the chew cycle. The differences between lepidosaurs and primates do not lie in the nature of the sensory information collected and its feedback to the feeding system, but rather the processing of that information by the CNS and its use feed-forward for modulating jaw movements and gape cycle phase durations during chewing."},{"title":"Configural processing enables discrimination and categorization of face-like stimuli in honeybees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/593","abstract":"We studied whether honeybees can distinguish face-like configurations by using standardized stimuli commonly employed in primate and human visual research. Furthermore, we studied whether, irrespective of their capacity to distinguish between face-like stimuli, bees learn to classify visual stimuli built up of the same elements in face-like versus non-face-like categories. We showed that bees succeeded in discriminating both face-like and non-face-like stimuli and categorized appropriately novel stimuli in these two classes. To this end, they used configural information and not just isolated features or low-level cues. Bees looked for a specific configuration in which each feature had to be located in an appropriate spatial relationship with respect to the others, thus showing sensitivity for first-order relationships between features. Although faces are biologically irrelevant stimuli for bees, the fact that they were able to integrate visual features into complex representations suggests that face-like stimulus categorization can occur even in the absence of brain regions specialized in face processing."},{"title":"Condition and mass impact oxygen stores and dive duration in adult female northern elephant seals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/585","abstract":"The range of foraging behaviors available to deep-diving, air-breathing marine vertebrates is constrained by their physiological capacity to breath-hold dive. We measured body oxygen stores (blood volume and muscle myoglobin) and diving behavior in adult female northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris, to investigate age-related effects on diving performance. Blood volume averaged 74.4±17.0 liters in female elephant seals or 20.2±2.0% of body mass. Plasma volume averaged 32.2±7.8 liters or 8.7±0.7% of body mass. Absolute plasma volume and blood volume increased independently with mass and age. Hematocrit decreased weakly with mass but did not vary with age. Muscle myoglobin concentration, while higher than previously reported (7.4±0.7 g%), did not vary with mass or age. Pregnancy status did not influence blood volume. Mean dive duration, a proxy for physiological demand, increased as a function of how long seals had been at sea, followed by mass and hematocrit. Strong effects of female body mass (range, 218-600 kg) on dive duration, which were independent of oxygen stores, suggest that larger females had lower diving metabolic rates. A tendency for dives to exceed calculated aerobic limits occurred more frequently later in the at-sea migration. Our data suggest that individual physiological state variables and condition interact to determine breath-hold ability and that both should be considered in life-history studies of foraging behavior."},{"title":"Aerodynamic damping during rapid flight maneuvers in the fruit fly Drosophila","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/602","abstract":"We systematically investigated the effect of body rotation on the aerodynamic torque generation on flapping wings during fast turning maneuvers (body saccades) in the fruit fly Drosophila. A quasi-steady aerodynamic simulation of turning maneuvers with symmetrically flapping wings showed that body rotation causes a substantial aerodynamic counter-torque, known as flapping counter-torque (FCT), which acts in the opposite direction to turning. Simulation results further indicate that FCTs are linearly dependent on the rotational velocity and the flapping frequency regardless of the kinematics of wing motion. We estimated the damping coefficients for the principal rotation axes — roll, pitch, yaw — in the stroke plane frame. FCT-induced passive damping exists about all the rotation axes examined, suggesting that the effects of body rotation cannot be ignored in the analysis of free-flight dynamics. Force measurements on a dynamically scaled robotic wing undergoing realistic saccade kinematics showed that although passive aerodynamic damping due to FCT can account for a large part of the deceleration during saccades, active yaw torque from asymmetric wing motion is required to terminate body rotation. In addition, we calculated the mean value of the damping coefficient at 21.00 ×10−12 N m s based on free-flight data of saccades, which is somewhat lower than that estimated by the simulation results (26.84×10−12 N m s)."},{"title":"Distinct startle responses are associated with neuroanatomical differences in pufferfishes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/613","abstract":"Despite the key function of the Mauthner cells (M-cells) in initiating escape responses and thereby promoting survival, there are multiple examples of M-cell loss across the teleost phylogeny. Only a few studies have directly considered the behavioral consequences of naturally occurring M-cell variation across species. We chose to examine this issue in pufferfishes, as previous research suggested that there might be variability in M-cell anatomy in this group of fish. We characterized the M-cell anatomy and fast-start responses of two pufferfish species, Tetraodon nigroviridis and Diodon holocanthus. T. nigroviridis showed robust fast-starts to both tactile and acoustic startling stimuli. These fast-starts occurred with a latency typical of M-cell initiation in other fish, and retrograde labeling of spinal-projection neurons revealed that T. nigroviridis does have M-cells. By contrast, D. holocanthus only rarely exhibited fast-start-like behavior, and these responses were at a substantially longer latency and were much less extensive than those of T. nigroviridis. Using three complementary anatomical techniques we were unable to identify obvious M-cell candidates in D. holocanthus. These results provide a clear correlation between M-cell presence or absence and dramatic differences in fast-start behavior. The rich diversity within the pufferfish clade should allow future studies investigating the factors that contribute to this correlated anatomical and behavioral variation."},{"title":"Function of the appendages in tentacled snakes (Erpeton tentaculatus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/359","abstract":"We investigated the function of the tentacles in aquatic, piscivorous tentacled snakes (Erpeton tentaculatus) by examining anatomy, peripheral innervation, and the response properties of primary afferents. We also investigated visual and somatosensory responses in the optic tectum and documented predatory strikes to visual stimuli and under infrared illumination. Our results show the tentacles are sensitive mechanoreceptors that respond to water movements. They are innervated by rami of the maxillary and ophthalmic branches of the trigeminal nerve and contain a dense array of fine terminal neurites that cross the interior of the tentacle orthogonal to its long axis. The optic tectum contained a retinotopic map of contralateral receptive fields with superior fields represented dorsally in the tectum, inferior fields represented laterally, nasal fields represented rostrally, and temporal fields represented caudally. Large somatosensory receptive fields were identified in deeper layers of the tectum and were in approximate register with overlying visual fields. Tentacled snakes struck accurately at a simulated digital fish, indicating that visual cues are sufficient to guide strikes, but they also captured fish under infrared illumination, suggesting water movements alone could be used to localize prey. We conclude the tentacles are mechanosensors that are used to detect fish position based on water movements and that visual and mechanosensory cues may be integrated in the tectum to enhance localization when visual cues are reduced."},{"title":"Kinematics and hydrodynamics analysis of swimming anurans reveals striking inter-specific differences in the mechanism for producing thrust","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/621","abstract":"This study aimed to compare the swimming kinematics and hydrodynamics within and among aquatic and semi-aquatic/terrestrial frogs. High-speed video was used to obtain kinematics of the leg joints and feet as animals swam freely across their natural range of speeds. Blade element analysis was then used to model the hydrodynamic thrust as a function of foot kinematics. Two purely aquatic frogs, Xenopus laevis and Hymenochirus boettgeri, were compared with two semi-aquatic/terrestrial frogs, Rana pipiens and Bufo americanus. The four species performed similarly. Among swimming strokes, peak stroke velocity ranged from 3.3±1.1 to 20.9±2.5, from 6.8±2.1 to 28.6±3.7 and from 4.9±0.5 to 20.9±4.1 body lengths per second (BL s−1) in X. laevis, H. boettgeri and R. pipiens, respectively (means ± s.d.; N=4 frogs for each). B. americanus swam much more slowly at 3.1±0.3 to 7.0±2.0 BL s−1 (N=3 frogs). Time-varying joint kinematics patterns were superficially similar among species. Because foot kinematics result from the cumulative motion of joints proximal to the feet, small differences in time-varying joint kinematics among species resulted in species-specific foot kinematics (therefore hydrodynamics) patterns. To obtain a simple measure of the hydrodynamically useful motion of the foot, this study uses ‘effective foot velocity’ (EFV): a measure of the component of foot velocity along the axis of swimming. Resolving EFV into translational and rotational components allows predictions of species-specific propulsion strategies. Additionally, a novel kinematic analysis is presented here that enables the partitioning of translational and rotational foot velocity into velocity components contributed by extension at each individual limb joint. Data from the kinematics analysis show that R. pipiens and B. americanus translated their feet faster than their body moved forward, resulting in positive net translational EFV. Conversely, translational EFV was slower than the body velocity in H. boettgeri and X. laevis, resulting in negative net translational EFV. Consequently, the translational component of thrust (caused mostly by hip, knee and ankle extension) was twofold higher than rotational thrust in Rana pipiens. Likewise, rotational components of thrust were nearly twofold higher than translational components in H. boettgeri. X. laevis, however, was the most skewed species observed, generating nearly 100% of total thrust by foot rotation generated by hip, ankle and tmt extension. Thus, this study presents a simple kinematics analysis that is predictive of hydrodynamic differences among species. Such differences in kinematics reveal a continuum of different propulsive strategies ranging from mostly rotation-powered (X. laevis) to mostly translation-powered (R. pipiens) swimming."},{"title":"Carbohydrate absorption by blackcap warblers (Sylvia atricapilla) changes during migratory refuelling stopovers","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/380","abstract":"Passerine birds migrating long distances arrive at stopover sites to refuel having lost as much as 50% of their initial body mass (mb), including significant losses to digestive organs that may serve as a reservoir of protein catabolised for fuel during flight. Birds newly arrived at a stopover show slow or no mb gain during the initial 2–3 days of a stopover, which suggests that energy assimilation may be limited by reduced digestive organs. Measurements of migrants and captive birds subjected to simulated migratory fasts have shown reductions in intestine mass, morphological changes to the mucosal epithelium, and reductions in food intake and assimilation rate upon initial refeeding. We found that blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla, Linnaeus) newly arrived at a migratory stopover after crossing the Sahara and Sinai deserts had significantly increased paracellular nutrient absorption (non-carrier mediated uptake occurring across tight junctions between enterocytes) that may provide partial compensation for reduced digestive capacity resulting from changes to intestinal tissues. Indeed, newly arrived birds also had a slightly reduced capacity for absorption of a glucose analogue (3-O-methyl-d-glucose) transported simultaneously by both carrier-mediated and non-mediated mechanisms. Increased paracellular absorption coupled with extended digesta retention time may thus allow migratory blackcaps to maintain high digestive efficiency during initial stages of refuelling while digestive organs are rebuilt."},{"title":"Aquaporin expression dynamics in osmoregulatory tissues of Atlantic salmon during smoltification and seawater acclimation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/368","abstract":"Osmotic balance in fish is maintained through the coordinated regulation of water and ion transport performed by epithelia in intestine, kidney and gill. In the current study, six aquaporin (AQP) isoforms found in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were classified and their tissue specificity and mRNA expression in response to a hyperosmotic challenge and during smoltification were examined. While AQP-1a was generic, AQP-1b had highest expression in kidney and AQP-3 was predominantly found in oesophagus, gill and muscle. Two novel teleost isoforms, AQP-8a and -8b, were expressed specifically in liver and intestinal segments, respectively. AQP-10 was predominantly expressed in intestinal segments, albeit at very low levels. Transfer from freshwater (FW) to seawater (SW) induced elevated levels of intestinal AQP-1a, -1b and -8b mRNA, whereas only AQP-8b was stimulated during smoltification. In kidney, AQP-1a, -3 and -10 were elevated in SW whereas AQP-1b was reduced compared with FW levels. Correspondingly, renal AQP-1a and -10 peaked during smoltification in April and March, respectively, as AQP-1b and AQP-3 declined. In the gill, AQP-1a and AQP-3 declined in SW whereas AQP-1b increased. Gill AQP-1a and -b peaked in April, whereas AQP-3 declined through smoltification. These reciprocal isoform shifts in renal and gill tissues may be functionally linked with the changed role of these organs in FW compared with SW. The presence and observed dynamics of the AQP-8b isoform specifically in intestinal sections suggest that this is a key water channel responsible for water uptake in the intestinal tract of seawater salmonids."},{"title":"Use of an alarm pheromone against ants for gaining access to aphid/scale prey by the red velvet mite Balaustium sp. (Erythraeidae) in a honeydew-rich environment","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/386","abstract":"This study shows that honeydew prompts arrestment and reduced activity, but not attraction, by the mite Balaustium sp. nr. putmani. When presented with short-range, two-choice bioassays, mites ceased their characteristic rapid crawling activity when they encountered honeydew-treated surfaces, resulting in them clustering around the honeydew. Approximately 80% of mites were retained by honeydew, with responses being independent of both mite life-history stage and source of honeydew (coccid scale insect or aphid). No obvious crawling movements or redirection of running path were made to the honeydew by the mites, implying the lack of any kind of attractant. Response of mites to single-sugar presentations of the main honeydew components – glucose, sucrose, fructose and trehalose – (0.001–0.1 mmol l–1) were inconsistent and failed to reproduce the arrestment/clustering associated with raw honeydew, suggesting that none of these sugars is an active arrestant ingredient. Formation of feeding clusters on honeydew does not contribute to enhancing water conservation by suppressing net transpiration (water loss) rates of individual mites as group size increases, indicating that the clustering is an artifact of arrestment. We hypothesize that release of neryl formate by the mites reduces negative interactions with the local ant species commonly associated with honeydew. We hypothesize that honeydew serves as: (1) a cue that facilitates discovery of scale/aphid prey; (2) a retainer on plants where these prey are present, signaling abundance and quality; and (3) an alternative and supplemental food source like that noted for other plant-inhabiting predatory mites. Neryl formate serves as an alarm pheromone and foul-tasting allomonal defense secretion that prevents predation of mites by ants that co-exist with aphid/scale insects in these honeydew-rich habitats."},{"title":"Seasonality of torpor patterns and physiological variables of a free-ranging subtropical bat","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/393","abstract":"Seasonal changes in weather and food availability differ vastly between temperate and subtropical climates, yet knowledge on how free-ranging subtropical insectivorous bats cope with such changes is limited. We quantified ambient temperatures, torpor patterns and thermal physiology of subtropical insectivorous northern long-eared bats, Nyctophilus bifax, during summer (n=13) and winter (n=8) by temperature telemetry. As predicted, ambient conditions varied significantly between seasons, with warmer weather during summer. All bats used torpor on 85% of observation days during summer in comparison to 100% during winter. During summer, patterns of torpor varied and the duration of torpor bouts was not significantly affected by ambient temperature, whereas during winter torpor bout duration was negatively correlated with mean ambient temperature. Mean torpor bout duration in summer was 3.2±1.3 h and in winter was 26.8±11.3 h. Mean arousal time during summer was in the early afternoon and during winter in the late afternoon, and throughout both seasons arousals for possible foraging periods occurred near sunset. Skin temperature was positively correlated with ambient temperatures in both seasons, but the relationship differed between seasons. We show that torpor is used regularly throughout the year in a free-ranging subtropical bat and provide the first evidence demonstrating that torpor patterns and thermal physiology change with season."},{"title":"Oxidative stress and the effect of parasites on a carotenoid-based ornament","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/400","abstract":"Oxidative stress, the physiological condition whereby the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species overwhelms the capacity of antioxidant defences, causes damage to key bio-molecules. It has been implicated in many diseases, and is proposed as a reliable currency in the trade-off between individual health and ornamentation. Whether oxidative stress mediates the expression of carotenoid-based signals, which are among the commonest signals of many birds, fish and reptiles, remains controversial. In the present study, we explored interactions between parasites, oxidative stress and the carotenoid-based ornamentation of red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. We tested whether removing nematode parasites influenced both oxidative balance (levels of oxidative damage and circulating antioxidant defences) and carotenoid-based ornamentation. At the treatment group level, parasite purging enhanced the size and colouration of ornaments but did not significantly affect circulating carotenoids, antioxidant defences or oxidative damage. However, relative changes in these traits among individuals indicated that males with a greater number of parasites prior to treatment (parasite purging) showed a greater increase in the levels of circulating carotenoids and antioxidants, and a greater decrease in oxidative damage, than those with initially fewer parasites. At the individual level, a greater increase in carotenoid pigmentation was associated with a greater reduction in oxidative damage. Therefore, an individual's ability to express a carotenoid-based ornament appeared to be linked to its current oxidative balance and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Our experimental results suggest that oxidative stress can mediate the impact of parasites on carotenoid-based signals, and we discuss possible mechanisms linking carotenoid-based ornaments to oxidative stress."},{"title":"Characterization of ion transport in the isolated epipodite of the lobster Homarus americanus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/418","abstract":"Unfolded epipodite isolated from American lobsters (Homarus americanus) acclimated to dilute seawater was mounted in an Ussing-type chamber for ion transport studies. The split epipodite is an electrically polarized, one-cell-layer epithelium supported with cuticle. Under open-circuit conditions, the transepithelial potential was –4.2±1.0 mV (N=38). In the short-circuited epithelium, the current averaged over all of the preparations was –185.4±20.2 A cm–2 (N=38) with a high conductance of 55.2±11.4 mS cm–2 (N=38), typical for a leaky epithelium. The Na:Cl absorptive flux ratio was 1:1.6; ion substitution experiments indicated that the transport of Na+ and Cl– is coupled. Basolateral application of the Cl– channel blockers 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoate (NPPB) and niflumic acid (NFA) dose-dependently inhibited short-circuit current (ISC). Secretory K+ (Rb+) fluxes exceeded influxes and were inhibited by the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain and the K+ channel blocker cesium. Western blot analysis showed that Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit protein was more highly expressed in the epipodite of lobsters acclimated to 20 p.p.t. compared with animals acclimated to seawater (34 p.p.t.). 3-Isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX) stimulated a negative ISC and enhanced apical secretory K+ flux. Basolateral application of NPPB inhibited JRbB→A fluxes, suggesting the interaction of K+ channels with NPPB-sensitive Cl– channels. The results are summarized in a transport model, suggesting apical Na+/K+/2Cl– co-transport, a dominant apical K+-secreting channel and basolaterally located Cl– and K+ channels. This study represents the first comprehensive characterization of ion transport processes across the lobster epipodite epithelium and indeed in any tissue within the branchial cavity of the American lobster."},{"title":"Limits to vertical force and power production in bumblebees (Hymenoptera: Bombus impatiens)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/426","abstract":"Maximum vertical forces produced by flying animals can be difficult to identify unequivocally, but potentially indicate general limits to aerodynamic force and muscle power output. We used two methods (i.e. incremental addition of supplemental mass and asymptotic load lifting) to determine both the intraspecific allometry of and methodological differences in estimates of maximum flight performance for the bumblebee Bombus impatiens. We found that incremental mass addition underestimated maximum lifting capacity by approximately 18% relative to values obtained by asymptotically increasing the applied load during a lifting bout. In asymptotic loading, bumblebees lifted on average 53% of their body weight, and demonstrated a significantly negative allometry of maximum aerodynamic force production relative to thoracic muscle mass. Estimates of maximum body mass-specific mechanical power output increased intraspecifically with body mass to the 0.38–0.50 power, depending on values assumed for the profile drag coefficient. We also found a significant reduction in vertical force production when both hindwings were removed. Limits to load-lifting capacity ultimately co-occur with an upper bound on stroke amplitude (∼145 deg.). Although thoracic muscle mass showed positive allometry, overall load-lifting performance exhibited significant size-dependent degradation."},{"title":"Approaching the evolutionary advantage of ancillary types of haemoglobin in Daphnia magna by simulation of oxygen supply","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/408","abstract":"The planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna synthesizes haemoglobin (Hb) macromolecules of variant subunit composition and oxygen affinity. This is one of the strategies by which the animals cope with variations in environmental conditions such as ambient oxygen tension. The enrichment of high-affinity Hb molecules in the haemolymph of hypoxia-exposed animals is thought to reduce Hb synthesis costs due to an enhanced transport efficiency of these molecules in comparison to the low-affinity Hb molecules. How great this economic advantage is, and under which conditions this benefit disappears, is still not fully understood. Here we implemented a rigorously simplified model of the daphnid body and described the transport of oxygen from the environment via the haemolymph to the tissues in terms of the convection–diffusion–reaction equation. The model was validated by comparing various model predictions with experimental data. A sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the influence of parameter uncertainties on the model predictions. Cost–benefit analysis revealed in which way at the system's level the increase in Hb oxygen affinity improves the oxygen loading at the respiratory surfaces and impairs the release of oxygen to the tissues. The benefit arising from the improved oxygen loading exceeds the disadvantage of impaired unloading only under conditions where the ambient oxygen tension is critically low and the Hb concentration is high. The low-affinity Hb, on the other hand, provides an advantage given that the Hb concentration is low and the ambient oxygen tension is well above the critical level. Computer-aided modelling and simulation therefore provide valuable mechanistic insights into the driving forces that could have shaped the evolution of globin genes in daphnids."},{"title":"Temperature acclimation alters oxidative capacities and composition of membrane lipids without influencing activities of enzymatic antioxidants or susceptibility to lipid peroxidation in fish muscle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/445","abstract":"Cold acclimation of ectotherms results typically in enhanced oxidative capacities and lipid remodeling, changes that should increase the risk of lipid peroxidation (LPO). It is unclear whether activities of antioxidant enzymes may respond in a manner to mitigate the increased potential for LPO. The current study addresses these questions using killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus macrolepidotus) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) acclimated to 5 and 25°C for 9 days and 2 months, respectively. Because the effects of temperature acclimation on pro- and antioxidant metabolism may be confounded by variable activity levels among temperature groups, one species (killifish) was also subjected to a 9-day exercise acclimation. Oxidative capacity of glycolytic (skeletal) muscle (indicated by the activity of cytochrome c oxidase) was elevated by 1.5-fold in killifish, following cold acclimation, but was unchanged in cardiac muscle and also unaffected by exercise acclimation in either tissue. No changes in citrate synthase activity were detected in either tissue following temperature acclimation. Enzymatic antioxidants (catalase and superoxide dismutase) of either muscle type were unaltered by temperature or exercise acclimation. Mitochondria from glycolytic muscle of cold-acclimated killifish were enriched in highly oxidizable polyunsatured fatty acids (PUFA), including diacyl phospholipids (total carbons:total double bonds) 40:8 and 44:12. Increased oxidative capacity, coupled with elevated PUFA content in mitochondria from cold-acclimated animals did not, however, impact LPO susceptibility when measured with C11-BODIPY. The apparent mismatch between oxidative capacity and enzymatic antioxidants following temperature acclimation will be addressed in future studies."},{"title":"Effects of cadmium exposure and intermittent anoxia on nitric oxide metabolism in eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/433","abstract":"Nitric oxide (NO) is an intracellular signaling molecule synthesized by a group of enzymes called nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and involved in regulation of many cellular functions including mitochondrial metabolism and bioenergetics. In invertebrates, the involvement of NO in bioenergetics and metabolic responses to environmental stress is poorly understood. We determined sensitivity of mitochondrial and cellular respiration to NO and the effects of cadmium (Cd) and intermittent anoxia on NO metabolism in eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica. NOS activity was strongly suppressed by exposure to 50 μg l–1 Cd for 30 days (4.76 vs 1.19 pmol NO min–1 mg–1 protein in control and Cd-exposed oysters, respectively) and further decreased during anoxic exposure in Cd-exposed oysters but not in their control counterparts. Nitrate/nitrite content (indicative of NO levels) decreased during anoxic exposure to less than 10% of the normoxic values and recovered within 1 h of re-oxygenation in control oysters. In Cd-exposed oysters, the recovery of the normoxic NO levels lagged behind, reflecting their lower NOS activity. Oyster mitochondrial respiration was inhibited by exogenous NO, with sensitivity on a par with that of mammalian mitochondria, and ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration was significantly more sensitive to NO than resting respiration. In isolated gill cells, manipulations of endogenous NOS activity either with a specific NOS inhibitor (aminoguanidine) or a NOS substrate (l-arginine) had no effect on respiration, likely due to the fact that mitochondria in the resting state are relatively NO insensitive. Likewise, Cd-induced stimulation of cellular respiration did not correlate with decreased NOS activity in isolated gill cells. High sensitivity of phosphorylating (ADP-stimulated) oyster mitochondria to NO suggests that regulation of bioenergetics is an evolutionarily conserved function of NO and that NO-dependent regulation of metabolism may be most prominent under the conditions of high metabolic flux when the ADP-to-ATP ratio is high."},{"title":"Energy storage and synchronisation of hind leg movements during jumping in planthopper insects (Hemiptera, Issidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/469","abstract":"The hind legs of Issus (Hemiptera, Issidae) move in the same plane underneath the body, an arrangement that means they must also move synchronously to power jumping. Moreover, they move so quickly that energy must be stored before a jump and then released suddenly. High speed imaging and analysis of the mechanics of the proximal joints of the hind legs show that mechanical mechanisms ensure both synchrony of movements and energy storage. The hind trochantera move first in jumping and are synchronised to within 30 μs. Synchrony is achieved by mechanical interactions between small protrusions from each trochantera which fluoresce bright blue under specific wavelengths of ultra-violet light and which touch at the midline when the legs are cocked before a jump. In dead Issus, a depression force applied to a cocked hind leg, or to the tendon of its trochanteral depressor muscle causes a simultaneous depression of both hind legs. The protrusion of the hind leg that moves first nudges the other hind leg so that both move synchronously. Contractions of the trochanteral depressor muscles that precede a jump bend the metathoracic pleural arches of the internal skeleton. Large areas of these bow-shaped structures fluoresce bright blue in ultraviolet light, and the intensity of this fluorescence depends on the pH of the bathing saline. These are key signatures of the rubber-like protein resilin. The remainder of a pleural arch consists of stiff cuticle. Bending these composite structures stores energy and their recoil powers jumping."},{"title":"Experimental study on the mechanical properties of the horn sheaths from cattle","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/479","abstract":"Bovine horn is composed of a sheath of keratin overlying a bony core. Previous studies of the bovine horn sheath have focused mainly on its morphology and compositions. In the present paper, we performed a series of uniaxial tension, three-point bending, and fracture tests to investigate the structural and mechanical properties of the horn sheaths from subadult cattle, Bos taurus. The effects of hydration on the mechanical properties were examined and their variations along the longitudinal direction of the horn sheath were addressed. Scanning electron microscopy of the fracture surfaces showed that the horn sheath has a layered structure and, more interestingly, the laminae have a rippled appearance. The Young's modulus and tensile strength increase from 850 MPa and 40 MPa at 19% water content to 2.3 GPa and 154 MPa at 0% water content, respectively. The Poisson's ratio of the horn sheath was about 0.38. The critical stress intensity factor was about 4.76 MPa m1/2 at an intermediate hydration (8% water content), greater than that at 0% water content (3.86 MPa m1/2) and 19% water content (2.56 MPa m1/2). The bending properties of the samples varied along the length of the horn. The mean flexural moduli of the specimens in the distal, middle and proximal parts were about 6.26 GPa, 5.93 GPa and 4.98 GPa, respectively; whereas the mean yield strength in the distal segment was about 152.4 MPa, distinctly higher than that in the middle (135.7 MPa) and proximal parts (116.4 MPa). This study deepens our understanding of the relationships among optimal structure, property and function of cattle horn sheaths."},{"title":"Muscle coordination is key to the power output and mechanical efficiency of limb movements","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/487","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine which features of muscle mechanics and muscle coordination affect the power output from a limb during locomotion. Eight subjects were tested while cycling at maximum exertion for 25 min on a stationary dynamometer. Cadence and load were varied to span a range of power outputs and myoelectric activity was measured from 10 muscles in the leg. Cycle-by-cycle variations in muscle coordination, cadence and power output were observed and the EMG intensity across all muscles was used as an estimate of the metabolic cost for each cycle. Data for the cycles at greatest power output were separated into three groups: maximum power, 80% power but lower EMG intensity and 80% power and higher EMG intensity. Torque–angular velocity relations were determined for the ankle and knee joints. During cycling at maximum power output the ankle joint was not extending at the velocity necessary for maximum power output; thus, maximum limb power occurs when some of the individual muscles cannot be generating maximum power output. Increases in EMG intensity occurred with no increase in power output from the limb: these corresponded to decreases in the efficiency and changes in coordination. Increases in power were achieved that were not matched by equivalent increases in EMG intensity, but did occur with changes in coordination. It is proposed that the power output from the limb is limited by the coordination pattern of the muscles rather than the maximum power output from any one muscle itself."},{"title":"Hydrocarbon rank signatures correlate with differential oophagy and dominance behaviour in Polistes dominulus foundresses","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/453","abstract":"Social life offers animals increased fitness opportunities. However, the advantages are not evenly distributed and some individuals benefit more than others. The ultimate advantage of reaching the highest rank in a dominance hierarchy is the achievement of reproduction monopoly. In social insects, dominant individuals and queens keep their reproductive control through differential oophagy of unwanted eggs (egg policing). Egg recognition is the main proximate mechanism for maintaining reproductive dominance. In the social wasp Polistes dominulus, subordinate queens often lay eggs in the presence of the dominant individual. Combining gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and laboratory bioassays, we found that chemical differences between eggs of subordinate and dominant foundresses can explain the differential success in oophagy enjoyed by dominant individuals. We propose that dominance behaviour is an investigative behaviour as well as a ritualized agonistic behaviour. In fact, the frequency of dominance acts increases with the chemical similarity of the surfaces of dominant- and subordinate-laid eggs. Therefore, dominant individuals probably perform dominance behaviour to test the cuticular signatures of subordinates and so better assess the chemical profiles of subordinate eggs. Finally, we provide evidence that in particular social contexts, subordinate Polistes foundresses can develop ovaries as large as those of dominant individuals but nevertheless lay very few eggs. The subordinates probably lay a limited number of eggs to avoid unnecessary energy loss, as a result of efficient queen policing, but will start laying eggs as soon as the queen fails."},{"title":"Systemic thyroid hormone is necessary and sufficient to induce ultraviolet-sensitive cone loss in the juvenile rainbow trout retina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/493","abstract":"Rainbow trout possess ultraviolet-sensitive (UVS) cones in their retina that degenerate naturally during development. This phenomenon can be induced with exogenous thyroxine [T4, a thyroid hormone (TH)] treatment. However, the previous T4 exposure experiments employed static water immersion; a method that could introduce confounding stress effects on the fish. Because of this, it was uncertain if T4 alone was sufficient to induce retinal changes or if stress-related hormones were also necessary to initiate this process. Furthermore, it was unclear whether endogenous T4 was the factor responsible for initiating natural UVS cone loss during development. The current study examined the role of systemic T4 on the juvenile rainbow trout retina using a slow-release implant. Exogenous T4 treatment resulted in SWS1 opsin downregulation and UVS cone loss after four weeks of exposure, signifying that T4 is sufficient to induce this process. Blocking endogenous T4 production with propylthiouracil (PTU, an anti-thyroid agent) attenuated SWS1 downregulation and UVS cone loss in the retina of naturally developing rainbow trout, suggesting that endogenous T4 is necessary to initiate retinal remodelling during development. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that several TH-regulating components are expressed in the trout retina, and that expression levels of the TH receptor isoform TRβ and the type 2 deiodinase (D2) change with T4 treatment. This suggests that T4 may act directly on the retina to induce UVS cone loss. Taken together, these results demonstrate that systemic TH is necessary and sufficient to induce SWS1 opsin downregulation and UVS cone loss in the retina of juvenile rainbow trout."},{"title":"Basolateral NBCe1 plays a rate-limiting role in transepithelial intestinal HCO3– secretion, contributing to marine fish osmoregulation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/459","abstract":"Although endogenous CO2 hydration and serosal HCO3– are both known to contribute to the high rates of intestinal HCO3– secretion important to marine fish osmoregulation, the basolateral step by which transepithelial HCO3– secretion is accomplished has received little attention. Isolated intestine HCO3– secretion rates, transepithelial potential (TEP) and conductance were found to be dependent on serosal HCO3– concentration and sensitive to serosal DIDS. Elevated mucosal Cl– concentration had the unexpected effect of reducing HCO3– secretion rates, but did not affect electrophysiology. These characteristics indicate basolateral limitation of intestinal HCO3– secretion in seawater gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta. The isolated intestine has a high affinity for serosal HCO3– in the physiological range (Km=10.2 mmol l–1), indicating a potential to efficiently fine-tune systemic acid–base balance. We have confirmed high levels of intestinal tract expression of a basolateral Na+/HCO3– cotransporter of the electrogenic NBCe1 isoform in toadfish (tfNBCe1), which shows elevated expression following salinity challenge, indicating its importance in marine fish osmoregulation. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, isolated tfNBCe1 has transport characteristics similar to those in the isolated tissue, including a similar affinity for HCO3– (Km=8.5 mmol l–1). Reported affinity constants of NBC1 for Na+ are generally much lower than physiological Na+ concentrations, suggesting that cotransporter activity is more likely to be modulated by HCO3– rather than Na+ availability in vivo. These similar functional characteristics of isolated tfNBCe1 and the intact tissue suggest a role of this cotransporter in the high HCO3– secretion rates of the marine fish intestine."},{"title":"Deep supercooling, vitrification and limited survival to –100°C in the Alaskan beetle Cucujus clavipes puniceus (Coleoptera: Cucujidae) larvae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/502","abstract":"Larvae of the freeze-avoiding beetle Cucujus clavipes puniceus (Coleoptera: Cucujidae) in Alaska have mean supercooling points in winter of –35 to –42°C, with the lowest supercooling point recorded for an individual of –58°C. We previously noted that some larvae did not freeze when cooled to –80°C, and we speculated that these larvae vitrified. Here we present evidence through differential scanning calorimetry that C. c. puniceus larvae transition into a glass-like state at temperatures <–58°C and can avoid freezing to at least –150°C. This novel finding adds vitrification to the list of insect overwintering strategies. While overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, C. c. puniceus larvae may experience low ambient temperatures of around –40°C (and lower) when microhabitat is un-insulated because of low snow cover. Decreasing temperatures in winter are correlated with loss of body water from summer high levels near 2.0 to winter lows near 0.4 mg mg–1 dry mass and concomitant increases in glycerol concentrations (4–6 mol l–1) and thermal hysteresis. Finally, we provide direct evidence that Cucujus from Wiseman, Alaska, survive temperatures to –100°C."},{"title":"Substratum cavities affect growth-plasticity, allometry, movement and feeding rates in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/520","abstract":"We assessed the influence of rock cavities, or pits, on the growth dynamics and behavior of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. In a paired-designed, laboratory experiment, sea urchins were assigned to sandstone blocks that were either ‘Flat’ or had a ‘Pit’ drilled into the center. At the start, both groups were approximately the same shape and size. In just 2 months, the shapes of the tests were significantly different between the two treatments, with the Pit urchins having an increased height:diameter profile. This result demonstrates the plastic nature of the sea urchin test and that, despite its apparent rigidity, it is capable of deforming during growth. In addition, the presence of pits modified behavior and food consumption as well as allometric growth of the test and Aristotle's lantern. Sea urchins on Pit sandstone blocks tended to stay in the cavities and not move about the flat areas, whereas individuals on Flat blocks changed position. Sea urchins in the Pit treatment consumed less food and had relatively larger demipyramids (the ‘jaw’ ossicle in Aristotle's lantern). These morphological and allometric changes occurred over a short time-period (8–20 weeks). We conclude that microhabitat is an important factor in controlling the behavior and growth dynamics of the bioeroding sea urchin S. purpuratus."},{"title":"Erythropoietin elevates  but not voluntary wheel running in mice","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/510","abstract":"Voluntary activity is a complex trait, comprising both behavioral (motivation, reward) and anatomical/physiological (ability) elements.

To increase oxygen transport capacity, erythrocyte density was elevated by the administration of an erythropoietin (EPO) analogue. Mice were given two EPO injections, two days apart, at one of two dose levels (100 or 300 μg kg–1). Hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), maximal aerobic capacity during forced treadmill exercise (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/213/3/510/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/>) and voluntary wheel running were measured.

Both doses of EPO significantly (P<0.0001) increased [Hb] as compared with sham-injected animals, with no difference in [Hb] between the 100 μg kg–1 and 300 μg kg–1 dose levels (overall mean of 4.5 g dl–1 increase).

As such, it can be used as a model system for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of water permeability. We investigated AQP dynamics and water permeability in the pelvic skin of H. japonica following challenge with AVT, hydrins (intermediate peptides of pro-AVT) and β-adrenergic effectors. In the in vivo experiment, both AQP-h2 and AQP-h3 proteins were translocated to the apical plasma membrane in the principal cells of the first-reacting cell (FRC) layer in the pelvic skin following challenge with AVT, hydrin 1 and hydrin 2, thereby increasing the water permeability of the pelvic skin. The β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (IP) and its anatagonist propranolol (PP) in combination with AVT or hydrins were used as challenge in the in vitro experiment. IP increased water permeability whereas PP inhibited it, and both events were well correlated with the translocation of the AQPs to the apical membrane. In the PP+AVT-treated skins, labels for AQP-h2 and AQP-h3 were differentially visible among the principal cells; the apical plasma membrane of some cells was labeled while others were not, indicating that the response of PP or AVT is different from cell to cell. These results provide morphological evidence that the principal cells of the FRC layers may have two kinds of receptors: a V2 receptor and β-adrenergic receptor."},{"title":"Cellular mechanisms of acid secretion in the posterior midgut of the larval mosquito (Aedes aegypti)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/295","abstract":"The gut contents of larval mosquitoes are alkalinized by the anterior midgut and reacidified by the posterior midgut. In the present study the cellular mechanisms of reacidification were studied in isolated, perfused posterior midgut by measuring the transepithelial voltage (Vte) and the rate of acid secretion as indicated by the color change of m-cresol purple during intervals of perfusion stop. The lumen-positive Vte and reacidification were significantly increased by serotonin (0.2 μmol l−1). The V-type H+-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A (10 μmol l−1) on the luminal side inhibited acidification and decreased Vte. On the hemolymph side the carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor acetazolamide (1 mmol l−1) almost abolished Vte, but had no effect on acidification. Similarly, hemolymph-side DIDS (0.1 mmol l−1), DPC (0.5 mmol l−1), amiloride (1 mmol l−1) and ouabain (2.5 mmol l−1) significantly reduced Vte, whereas Ba2+ (5 mmol l−1) was without effect. DPC and amiloride also reduced Vte when applied to the luminal side of the epithelium. Unilateral substitution of gluconate for Cl− affected Vte in a way consistent with a greater permeability for Cl− versus Na+. Cl− replacement in the lumen decreased Vte, whereas replacement on the hemolymph side increased it. Bilateral replacement left the control voltage unaffected. Na+ replacement on either side of the tissue reduced Vte to different degrees. Omission of luminal amino acids was followed by a significant decrease in Vte. Except for concanamycin A, none of the above manipulations impaired acidification, indicating that acidification requires only the apical proton pump. However, the chemical source of secreted H+ is still unknown and needs to be investigated."},{"title":"Exposure to cold but not exercise increases carbon turnover rates in specific tissues of a passerine","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/3/526","abstract":"Carbon turnover differs between tissues within an animal, but the extent to which ecologically relevant increases in metabolism affect carbon turnover rates is largely unknown. We tested the energy expenditure and protein turnover hypotheses that predict increased carbon turnover, either in association with increased daily energy expenditure, or in concert with tissue-specific increased protein metabolism. We used stable-isotope-labeled diets to quantify the rate of carbon turnover in 12 different tissues for three groups of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata): cold-exposed birds kept at ambient temperatures below their thermoneutral zone, exercised birds that were flown for 2 h per day in a flight arena, and control birds that were kept at ambient temperatures within their thermoneutral zone and that were not exercised. We found that increases in metabolism associated with cold-exposure but not exercise produced measurable increases in carbon turnover rate of, on average, 2.4±0.3 days for pectoral muscle, gizzard, pancreas and heart, even though daily energy intake was similar for exercised and cold-exposed birds. This evidence does not support the energy expenditure hypothesis, and we invoke two physiological processes related to protein metabolism that can explain these treatment effects: organ mass increase and tissue-specific increase in activity. Such changes in carbon turnover rate associated with cold temperatures translate into substantial variation in the estimated time window for which resource use is estimated and this has important ecological relevance."},{"title":"Olfactory sensitivity to bile fluid and bile salts in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), goldfish (Carassius auratus) and Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) suggests a `broad range' sensitivity not confined to those produced by conspecifics alone","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/308","abstract":"Teleosts have high olfactory sensitivity to bile salts. To assess whether this phenomenon is involved in intra-specific chemical communication alone, or is part of a more `broad range' sensitivity to bile salts produced by heterospecifics, we investigated possible differences in the odour of bile between the sexes and among different species – the eel (Anguilla anguilla), goldfish (Carassius auratus) and Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) – using the electro-olfactogram (EOG). We also identified the main bile constituents by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. There were marked differences in olfactory response of the eel to thin-layer chromatography fractions of bile from both sexes, and mature and immature conspecifics. Smaller differences were seen in the potency of fractions of bile from male and female goldfish and tilapia. Eels, goldfish and tilapia demonstrated similar olfactory sensitivity to bile from a range of different species, with no apparent correlation between the olfactory potency of bile and a phylogenetic closeness and/or similarity of diet of the donor to the receiver. The three species were able to detect odorants in thin-layer chromatography fractions of heterospecific bile even in the absence of activity in conspecific bile. Eels, goldfish and tilapia responded to both sulphated C27 bile salts (5β-scymnol-sulphate and 5α-cyprinol sulphate) and to taurine-conjugated C24 bile salts (taurochenodeoxycholic acid, taurolithocholic acid and taurocholic acid), irrespective of whether these bile salts were present in conspecific bile. Together, these results suggest that teleosts have a broad-range olfactory sensitivity to bile salts, with potential roles in both intra-specific chemical communication and in inter-specific interactions."},{"title":"Predator detection enables juvenile Lymnaea to form long-term memory","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/301","abstract":"Learning and memory provide the flexibility an organism requires to respond to changing social and ecological conditions. Juvenile Lymnaea have previously been shown to have a diminished capacity to form long-term memory (LTM) following operant conditioning of aerial respiratory behavior. Juvenile Lymnaea, however, can form LTM following classical conditioning of appetitive behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that laboratory-reared juvenile Lymnaea have the ability to detect the presence of a sympatric predator (i.e. crayfish) and respond to the predator by altering their aerial respiratory behavior. In addition to increasing their total breathing time, predator detection confers on juvenile Lymnaea an enhanced capability to form LTM following operant conditioning of aerial respiratory behavior. That is, these juveniles now have the ability to form long-lasting memory. These data support the hypothesis that biologically relevant levels of stress associated with predator detection induce behavioral phenotypic alterations (i.e. enhanced LTM formation) in juveniles, which may increase their fitness. These data also support the notion that learning and memory formation in conjunction with predator detection is a form of inducible defense."},{"title":"Behavioural state affects motion-sensitive neurones in the fly visual system","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/331","abstract":"The strength of stimulus-induced responses at the neuronal and the behavioural level often depends on the internal state of an animal. Within pathways processing sensory information and eventually controlling behavioural responses, such gain changes can originate at several sites. Using motion-sensitive lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs) of blowflies, we address whether and in which way information processing changes for two different states of motor activity. We distinguish between the two states on the basis of haltere movements. Halteres are the evolutionarily transformed hindwings of flies. They oscillate when the animals walk or fly. LPTCs mediate, amongst other behaviours, head optomotor responses. These are either of large or small amplitude depending on the state of motor activity. Here we find that LPTC responses also depend on the motor activity of flies. In particular, LPTC responses are enhanced when halteres oscillate. Nevertheless, the response changes of LPTCs do not account for the corresponding large gain changes of head movements. Moreover, haltere activity itself does not change the activity of LPTCs. Instead, we propose that a central signal associated with motor activity changes the gain of head optomotor responses and the response properties of LPTCs."},{"title":"The role of granules within viscous capture threads of orb-weaving spiders","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/339","abstract":"Sticky viscous prey capture threads form the spiral elements of spider orb-webs and are responsible for retaining insects that strike a web. These threads are formed of regularly spaced aqueous droplets that surround a pair of supporting axial fibers. When a thread is flattened on a microscope slide a small, opaque granule can usually be seen within each droplet. These granules have been thought to be the glycoprotein glue that imparts thread adhesion. Both independent contrast and standard regressions showed that granule size is directly related to droplet volume and indicated that granule volume is about 15% of droplet volume. We attempted to find support for the hypothesized adhesive role of granules by establishing an association between the contact surface area and volume of these granules and the stickiness of the viscous threads of 16 species in the context of a six-variable model that describes thread stickiness. However, we found that granule size made either an insignificant or a small negative contribution to thread stickiness. Consequently, we hypothesize that granules serve to anchor larger, surrounding layers of transparent glycoprotein glue to the axial fibers of the thread, thereby equipping droplets to resist slippage on the axial fibers as these droplets generate adhesion, elongate under a load, and transfer force to the axial fibers."},{"title":"The influence of strain and activation on the locomotor function of rat ankle extensor muscles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/318","abstract":"The ankle extensor muscles of the rat have different mechanical and physiological properties, providing a means of studying how changes in locomotor demands influence muscle fascicle behaviour, force and mechanical power output in different populations of muscle fibre types. Muscle fascicle strain, strain rate and activation patterns in the soleus, plantaris and medial gastrocnemius muscles of the rat were quantified from sonomicrometric and myoelectric data, collected during treadmill locomotion under nine velocity/incline conditions. Significant differences in peak-to-peak muscle fascicle strains and strain rates were identified between the three muscles (P<0.001, all cases), with much smaller strains (<0.1) and strain rates (<0.5 s−1) occurring in soleus and plantaris compared with medial gastrocnemius (>0.2 and >1.0 s−1, respectively). The proportion of stride duration that each muscle was active (duty cycle) differed between locomotor conditions as did the timing of the activation and deactivation phases. A simple Hill-based muscle model was used to determine the influence of muscle activation relative to maximum fascicle strain and duty cycle on total force production and mechanical power output, from a slow and a fast muscle fibre, simulated through two peak-to-peak strain cycles (0.1 and 0.3). The predictions of the model did not complement conclusions that may be drawn from the observation of myoelectric timing and fascicle strain trajectories in each of the muscles. The model predicted that changes in mechanical power output were more sensitive to changes in activation parameters than to changes in strain trajectories, with subtle changes in activation phase and duty cycle significantly affecting predicted mechanical power output."},{"title":"Hyperthermia-induced Hsp70 and MT20 transcriptional upregulation are mediated by p38-MAPK and JNKs in Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck); a pro-survival response","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/347","abstract":"In the present study we investigated the signal transduction cascades triggered by acute thermal stress in Mytilus galloprovincialis gills. This particular species has been reported to exhibit a significant tolerance to high temperatures; thus, it was intriguing to examine the molecular mechanisms responsible for this extraordinary trait. In particular, exposure to 30°C was found to cause a significant and sustained stimulation of p38-MAPK phosphorylation while the activation profile of JNKs was transient and relatively moderate. We also observed that hyperthermia induced apoptosis as a delayed response, with both MAPK subfamilies rapidly translocating to the nucleus. The phosphorylation of cJun, ATF2 and NFκB was detected next. Using selective inhibitors, phosphorylation of these transcription factors was established to be dependent on p38-MAPK or JNKs. Subsequently, potential changes in gene expression were assessed. In this context, hyperthermia resulted in the transcriptional upregulation of Hsp70 and MT20 genes with a widely known salutary effect, preserving mussel fitness and performance under adverse environmental conditions. Interestingly, p38-MAPK and JNKs were found to mediate the hyperthermia-induced Hsp70 and MT20 upregulation as well as the delayed induction of apoptosis under the interventions studied. Overall this is, to our knowledge, the first time that an insight into the compensatory survival `programme' initiated in Mytilus galloprovincialis gills, contributing to this organism's exceptional tolerance to thermal stress, has been gained. In particular, we provide evidence demonstrating the principal role of p38-MAPK and JNKs in transducing the stress signal via mobilization of specific transcription factors and the transcriptional upregulation of cytoprotective genes."},{"title":"Age-dependent allocation of carotenoids to coloration versus antioxidant defences","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/271","abstract":"Aging is commonly attributed to age-related changes in oxidative damage due to an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a weakened efficacy of enzymatic antioxidants. These age-related changes might therefore modify the use of dietary antioxidants, including carotenoids. As carotenoids are closely associated with the expression of secondary sexual signals, the allocation of carotenoids to sexual signal versus antioxidant defences may vary with age. In this study, we explored how carotenoid-based ornament and antioxidant activity varied with age and how an inflammatory-induced oxidative burst affected ornament and antioxidant activity across a range of ages. Using zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) as a model species, we assessed circulating carotenoids, beak coloration and the plasma antioxidant status of birds of different ages before and after an inflammatory challenge. Our results show that old individuals display similar carotenoid-based sexual signals regardless of the availability of circulating carotenoids, suggesting a terminal investment of old individuals in their last reproductive event. Additionally, we found that an inflammatory insult induced a decrease in the total antioxidant activity and in the expression of a carotenoid-based sexual signal in the oldest individuals. These results suggest that old individuals pay an extra cost of immune activation possibly because the efficiency of antioxidant machinery varies with age."},{"title":"Proteomic and physiological responses of leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata) to salinity change","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/210","abstract":"Partially euryhaline elasmobranchs may tolerate physiologically challenging, variable salinity conditions in estuaries as a trade-off to reduce predation risk or to gain access to abundant food resources. To further understand these trade-offs and to evaluate the underlying mechanisms, we examined the responses of juvenile leopard sharks to salinity changes using a suite of measurements at multiple organizational levels: gill and rectal gland proteomes (using 2-D gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry), tissue biochemistry (Na+/K+-ATPase, caspase 3/7 and chymotrypsin-like proteasome activities), organismal physiology (hematology, plasma composition, muscle moisture) and individual behavior. Our proteomics results reveal coordinated molecular responses to low salinity – several of which are common to both rectal gland and gill – including changes in amino acid and inositol (i.e. osmolyte) metabolism, energy metabolism and proteins related to transcription, translation and protein degradation. Overall, leopard sharks employ a strategy of maintaining plasma urea, ion concentrations and Na+/K+-ATPase activities in the short-term, possibly because they rarely spend extended periods in low salinity conditions in the wild, but the sharks osmoconform to the surrounding conditions by 3 weeks. We found no evidence of apoptosis at the time points tested, while both tissues exhibited proteomic changes related to the cytoskeleton, suggesting that leopard sharks remodel existing osmoregulatory epithelial cells and activate physiological acclimatory responses to solve the problems posed by low salinity exposure. The behavioral measurements reveal increased activity in the lowest salinity in the short-term, while activity decreased in the lowest salinity in the long-term.

We examined repeatability of RMRt in female MF1 mice over short (15 days apart; N=238) and long intervals (110 days apart; N=33). In the long-term experiment, after the first RMRt measurement, females were separated in two groups: the first was kept virgin (N=16); the second was allowed to breed (N=17) and measured 15 days after they had weaned their pups. We also examined the association between RMRt and reproduction. We used Pearson's correlation (r) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ρ) to estimate repeatability. There was a strong effect of body mass on RMRt for all measurements. Over the short interval, repeatability was significant for body mass (r=0.86; ρ=0.86), RMRt (r=0.68; ρ=0.68,) and residual-RMRt (r=0.58; ρ=0.58). Over long intervals, repeatability of residual-RMRt was high in virgin females (r=0.59; ρ=0.60), but not in the breeders (r=0.38; ρ=0.39); body mass was repeatable only for non-breeders measured by r (r=0.55). There was no significant correlation between RMRt or residual-RMRt and litter size or litter mass. In conclusion, RMRt and residual-RMRt are highly repeatable traits in virgin MF1 female mice. The lack of association between non-reproductive RMRt and reproductive performance in MF1 mice does not come about because of its poor repeatability."},{"title":"Eating chemically defended prey: alkaloid metabolism in an invasive ladybird predator of other ladybirds (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/237","abstract":"By comparison with studies of herbivore physiological adaptation to plant allelochemicals, work on predator physiological adaptation to potentially toxic prey has been very limited. Such studies are important in understanding how evolution could shape predator diets. An interesting question is the specificity of predator adaptation to prey allelochemicals, given that many predators consume diverse prey with different chemical defences. The ladybird Harmonia axyridis, an invasive species in America, Europe and Africa, is considered a significant predatory threat to native invertebrates, particularly other aphid-eating ladybirds of which it is a strong intraguild predator. Although ladybirds possess species-specific alkaloid defences, H. axyridis exhibits high tolerance for allospecific ladybird prey alkaloids. Nonetheless, it performs poorly on species with novel alkaloids not commonly occurring within its natural range. We examined alkaloid fate in H. axyridis larvae after consumption of two other ladybird species, one containing an alkaloid historically occurring within the predator's native range (isopropyleine) and one containing a novel alkaloid that does not (adaline). Our results indicate that H. axyridis rapidly chemically modifies the alkaloid to which it has been historically exposed to render it less harmful: this probably occurs outside of the gut. The novel, more toxic alkaloid persists in the body unchanged for longer. Our results suggest metabolic alkaloid specialisation, in spite of the diversity of chemically defended prey that the predator consumes. Physiological adaptations appear to have made H. axyridis a successful predator of other ladybirds; however, limitations are imposed by its physiology when it eats prey with novel alkaloids."},{"title":"Electric signals and species recognition in the wave-type gymnotiform fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/225","abstract":"Gymnotiformes are South American weakly electric fish that produce weak electric organ discharges (EOD) for orientation, foraging and communication purposes. It has been shown that EOD properties vary widely across species and could thus be used as species recognition signals. We measured and quantified the electric signals of various species using a landmark-based approach. Using discriminant function analysis to verify whether these signals are species specific based on different signal parameters, we found that the EOD waveform is a more specific cue than EOD frequency, which shows large overlap across species. Using Apteronotus leptorhynchus as a focal species, we then performed a series of playback experiments using stimuli of different species (varying in frequency, waveform, or both). In an experiment with restrained fish, we found, in contrast to what we predicted, that the choice of stimulus waveform did not affect the production of communication signals. In an experiment with free-swimming fish, the animals spent more time near the playback electrodes and produced more communication signals when the stimuli were within their conspecific frequency range. Waveform again had no measurable effect. The production of communication signals correlated with the frequency difference between the stimulus and the fish's own EOD, but approach behavior did not."},{"title":"Thermal plasticity in young snakes: how will climate change affect the thermoregulatory tactics of ectotherms?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/242","abstract":"Climate change will result in some areas becoming warmer and others cooler, and will amplify the magnitude of year-to-year thermal variation in many areas. How will such changes affect animals that rely on ambient thermal heterogeneity to behaviourally regulate their body temperatures? To explore this question, we raised 43 captive-born tiger snakes Notechis scutatus in enclosures that provided cold (19–22°C), intermediate (19–26°C) or hot (19–37°C) thermal gradients. The snakes adjusted their diel timing of thermoregulatory behaviour so effectively that when tested 14 months later, body temperatures (mean and maximum), locomotor speeds and anti-predator behaviours did not differ among treatment groups. Thus, the young snakes modified their behaviour to compensate for restricted thermal opportunities. Then, we suddenly shifted ambient conditions to mimic year-to-year variation. In contrast to the earlier plasticity, snakes failed to adjust to this change, e.g. snakes raised at cooler treatments but then shifted to hot conditions showed a higher mean body temperature for at least two months after the onset of the new thermal regime. Hence, thermal conditions experienced early in life influenced subsequent thermoregulatory tactics; the mean selected temperature of a snake depended more upon its prior raising conditions than upon its current thermoregulatory opportunities. Behavioural plasticity thus allows snakes to adjust to suboptimal thermal conditions but this plasticity is limited. The major thermoregulatory challenge from global climate change may not be the shift in mean values (to which our young snakes adjusted) but the increased year-to-year variation (with which our snakes proved less able to deal)."},{"title":"Spatial vision in the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Echinoidea)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/249","abstract":"Recent evidence that echinoids of the genus Echinometra have moderate visual acuity that appears to be mediated by their spines screening off-axis light suggests that the urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, with its higher spine density, may have even more acute spatial vision. We analyzed the movements of 39 specimens of S. purpuratus after they were placed in the center of a featureless tank containing a round, black target that had an angular diameter of 6.5 deg. or 10 deg. (solid angles of 0.01 sr and 0.024 sr, respectively). An average orientation vector for each urchin was determined by testing the animal four times, with the target placed successively at bearings of 0 deg., 90 deg., 180 deg. and 270 deg. (relative to magnetic east). The urchins showed no significant unimodal or axial orientation relative to any non-target feature of the environment or relative to the changing position of the 6.5 deg. target. However, the urchins were strongly axially oriented relative to the changing position of the 10 deg. target (mean axis from –1 to 179 deg.; 95% confidence interval ± 12 deg.; P<0.001, Moore's non-parametric Hotelling's test), with 10 of the 20 urchins tested against that target choosing an average bearing within 10 deg. of either the target center or its opposite direction (two would be expected by chance). In addition, the average length of the 20 target-normalized bearings for the 10 deg. target (each the vector sum of the bearings for the four trials) were far higher than would be expected by chance (P<10−10; Monte Carlo simulation), showing that each urchin, whether it moved towards or away from the target, did so with high consistency. These results strongly suggest that S. purpuratus detected the 10 deg. target, responding either by approaching it or fleeing it. Given that the urchins did not appear to respond to the 6.5 deg. target, it is likely that the 10 deg. target was close to the minimum detectable size for this species. Interestingly, measurements of the spine density of the regions of the test that faced horizontally predicted a similar visual resolution (8.3±0.5 deg. for the interambulacrum and 11±0.54 deg. for the ambulacrum). The function of this relatively low, but functional, acuity – on par with that of the chambered Nautilus and the horseshoe crab – is unclear but, given the bimodal response, is likely to be related to both shelter seeking and predator avoidance."},{"title":"Responses of alkaline phosphatase activity to phosphorus stress in Daphnia magna","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/256","abstract":"We examined how alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity within the bodies and in the materials released by the crustacean Daphnia magna responds to variable algal food phosphorus (P)-content. We found that Daphnia eating P-poor food (C:P∼700) had significantly higher AP activity in their bodies on a mass-specific basis compared with individuals eating P-rich food (C:P∼100). This dietary P effect on AP activity was not altered by Daphnia starvation but was partially related to differences in the P concentration of animal body homogenates. By contrast, poor P-nutrition of Daphnia lowered AP activity in released materials compared with that measured from their P-sufficient conspecifics. Moreover, AP activity in Daphnia release was lowest in animals consuming P-poor food for longer time periods. Our results support the hypothesis that AP activity increases inside P-limited Daphnia as a mechanism to increase P-acquisition and retention from ingested algae in these nutritionally stressed animals. The lower level of AP activity present in the water of P-deprived animals could reflect a change from largely free to membrane-bound AP isotypes in the digestive tracts of P-starved animals or a decrease in the shedding of membrane-anchored AP from their intestinal lining. These results supplement accumulating evidence that P-poor algal food reduces the dietary mineral P available to Daphnia. In addition, animal body AP activity measurements, with some refinement, may prove useful as an in situ indicator of P-stress in aquatic consumers."},{"title":"The moment before touchdown: landing manoeuvres of the honeybee Apis mellifera","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/262","abstract":"Although landing is a crucial part of insect flight, it has attracted relatively little study. Here, we investigate, for the first time, the final moments of a honeybee's (Apis mellifera) landing manoeuvre. Using high-speed video recordings, we analyse the behaviour of bees as they approach and land on surfaces of various orientations. The bees enter a stable hover phase, immediately prior to touchdown. We have quantified behaviour during this hover phase and examined whether it changes as the tilt of the landing surface is varied from horizontal (floor), through sloped (uphill) and vertical (wall), to inverted (ceiling). The bees hover at a remarkably constant distance from the surface, irrespective of its tilt. Body inclination increases progressively as the tilt of the surface is increased, and is accompanied by an elevation of the antennae. The tight correlation between the tilt of the surface, and the orientation of the body and the antennae, indicates that the bee's visual system is capable of inferring the tilt of the surface, and pointing the antennae toward it. Touchdown is initiated by extending the appendage closest to the surface, namely, the hind legs when landing on horizontal or sloping surfaces, and the front legs or antennae when landing on vertical surfaces. Touchdown on inverted surfaces is most likely triggered by a mechanosensory signal from the antennae. Evidently, bees use a landing strategy that is flexibly tailored to the varying topography of the terrain."},{"title":"Mottle camouflage patterns in cuttlefish: quantitative characterization and visual background stimuli that evoke them","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/187","abstract":"Cuttlefish and other cephalopods achieve dynamic background matching with two general classes of body patterns: uniform (or uniformly stippled) patterns and mottle patterns. Both pattern types have been described chiefly by the size scale and contrast of their skin components. Mottle body patterns in cephalopods have been characterized previously as small-to-moderate-scale light and dark skin patches (i.e. mottles) distributed somewhat evenly across the body surface. Here we move beyond this commonly accepted qualitative description by quantitatively measuring the scale and contrast of mottled skin components and relating these statistics to specific visual background stimuli (psychophysics approach) that evoke this type of background-matching pattern. Cuttlefish were tested on artificial and natural substrates to experimentally determine some primary visual background cues that evoke mottle patterns. Randomly distributed small-scale light and dark objects (or with some repetition of small-scale shapes/sizes) on a lighter substrate with moderate contrast are essential visual cues to elicit mottle camouflage patterns in cuttlefish. Lowering the mean luminance of the substrate without changing its spatial properties can modulate the mottle pattern toward disruptive patterns, which are of larger scale, different shape and higher contrast. Backgrounds throughout nature consist of a continuous range of spatial scales; backgrounds with medium-sized light/dark patches of moderate contrast are those in which cuttlefish Mottle patterns appear to be the most frequently observed."},{"title":"Dietary lipid levels have a remarkable impact on the expression of growth-related genes in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis Kaup)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/2/200","abstract":"In Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis Kaup), growth is negatively correlated to dietary lipid levels. To understand the molecular basis of this effect a molecular toolbox of 12 genes, including fgf6, fst, mstn1, myf5, mrf4, myod1, myod2, myog, myHC, mylc2, igf1r and insr, was developed. The expression profiles of these genes were investigated in white muscle and liver of fish fed with three dietary lipid levels (4%, 12% and 20%). The expression of igf-I and igf-II was also examined. MRFs and myosins were only expressed in the muscle and, except for myf5, the general trend was a decrease in expression with an increase in dietary lipids. Fgf6 was identified for the first time in liver and its expression augmented in hepatic tissues with increasing dietary lipid levels. A similar tendency was observed for mstn1 and igf-I. The opposite was observed for igf1r expression in muscle and liver. Myog, mrf4, mylc2 and igf1r were highly correlated with growth and nutrient utilisation indices.

Here, we show that a member of the insect calcitonin-like diuretic hormone (CLDH) family is present in the American lobster, Homarus americanus, serving, at least in part, as a powerful modulator of cardiac output. Specifically, during an ongoing EST project, a transcript encoding a putative H. americanus CLDH precursor was identified; a full-length cDNA was subsequently cloned. In silico analyses of the deduced prepro-hormone predicted the mature structure of the encoded CLDH to be GLDLGLGRGFSGSQAAKHLMGLAAANFAGGPamide (Homam-CLDH), which is identical to a known Tribolium castaneum peptide. RT-PCR tissue profiling suggests that Homam-CLDH is broadly distributed within the lobster nervous system, including the cardiac ganglion (CG), which controls the movement of the neurogenic heart. RT-PCR analysis conducted on pacemaker neuron- and motor neuron-specific cDNAs suggests that the motor neurons are the source of the CLDH message in the CG. Perfusion of Homam-CLDH through the isolated lobster heart produced dose-dependent increases in both contraction frequency and amplitude and a dose-dependent decrease in contraction duration, with threshold concentrations for all parameters in the range 10–11 to 10–10 mol l–1 or less, among the lowest for any peptide on this system.

To ensure optimal nervous system functionality and survival, nerve conduction velocities were likely to have increased to maintain the rate of signal propagation. Increases of conduction velocities may have required alterations in one of the two predominant properties that affect the speed of neuronal transmission: myelination or axonal diameter. A plausible mechanism to explain faster conduction velocities was a concomitant increase in axonal diameter with evolving axonal length. The carboxy terminal tail domain of the neurofilament medium subunit is a determinant of axonal diameter in large caliber myelinated axons. Sequence analysis of mammalian orthologs indicates that the neurofilament medium carboxy terminal tail contains a variable lysine–serine–proline (KSP) repeat sub-domain flanked by two highly conserved sub-domains. The number of KSP repeats within this region of neurofilament medium varies among species. Interestingly, the number of repeats does not change within a species, suggesting that selective pressure conserved the number of repeats within a species. Mapping KSP repeat numbers onto consensus phylogenetic trees reveals independent KSP expansion events across several mammalian clades. Linear regression analyses identified three subsets of mammals, one of which shows a positive correlation in the number of repeats with head–body length. For this subset of mammals, we hypothesize that variations in the number of KSP repeats within neurofilament medium carboxy terminal tail may have contributed to an increase in axonal caliber, increasing nerve conduction velocity as larger mammals evolved."},{"title":"Scanning sonar of rolling porpoises during prey capture dives","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/146","abstract":"Dolphins and porpoises have excellent biosonar ability, which they use for navigation, ranging and foraging. However, the role of biosonar in free-ranging small cetaceans has not been fully investigated. The biosonar behaviour and body movements of 15 free-ranging finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides) were observed using electronic tags attached to the animals. The porpoises often rotated their bodies more than 60 deg., on average, around the body axis in a dive bout. This behaviour occupied 31% of the dive duration during 186 h of effective observation time. Rolling dives were associated with extensive searching effort, and 23% of the rolling dive time was phonated, almost twice the phonation ratio of upright dives. Porpoises used short inter-click interval sonar 4.3 times more frequently during rolling dives than during upright dives. Sudden speed drops, which indicated that an individual turned around, occurred 4.5 times more frequently during rolling dives than during upright dives. Together, these data suggest that the porpoises searched extensively for targets and rolled their bodies to enlarge the search area by changing the narrow beam axis of the biosonar. Once a possible target was detected, porpoises frequently produced short-range sonar sounds. Continuous searching for prey and frequent capture trials appeared to occur during rolling dives of finless porpoises. In contrast, head movements ranging ±2 cm, which can also change the beam axis, were regularly observed during both dives. Head movements might assist in instant assessment of the arbitrary direction by changing the beam axis rather than prey searching and pursuit."},{"title":"Heart rate as a predictor of energy expenditure in undisturbed fasting and incubating penguins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/153","abstract":"Heart rate (fH) measurement offers the possibility to monitor energy expenditure (EE) in wild animals if the EE/fH relationship for the species, physiological stages and activities of interest is known.

Unfortunately, the potential effects of stress on the observed relationships resulting from handling and confinement were not considered. This study is the first involving undisturbed animals, and determines the EE/fH relationship in naturally fasting and freely incubating or captivity-acclimatized male and female king penguins. EE determination was based on (1) the measurement of body mass loss during periods of phase II fasting, and (2) the calculation of its energy equivalent from changes in body composition, i.e. 23.9 kJ g–1. fH levels in freely incubating and captivity-acclimatized birds were found to be 50–70% lower than those previously reported for resting king penguins during <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/213/1/153/embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\"/> measurements. Significant EE/fH relationships were found in freely incubating and captive males and females (R2=0.59 to 0.84), with no difference observed between genders. The best overall relationship was obtained by including fasting duration (t, days) in the model: EE=818+43.7×fH+36.3t–1.4t×fH (R2=0.91). This equation yielded EE estimates approximately 26% higher than the previously reported ‘best’ predictive equation in king penguins, and even more so when fH was low. This result suggests that stress induces a disproportionate increase of fH vs O2 consumption, and that the use of EE/fH relationships obtained in stressed birds could lead to underestimated EE values."},{"title":"Ecophysiological response of Adélie penguins facing an experimental increase in breeding constraints","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/33","abstract":"Foraging strategies play a key role in breeding effort. Little is known, however, about their connection with hormonal and nutritional states, especially when breeding constraints vary. Here, we experimentally increased foraging costs and thus breeding constraints by handicapping Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) with dummy devices representing 3–4% of the penguins' cross-sectional area. We examined food-related stress (via plasma corticosterone concentration) and nutritional state (via metabolite levels). Concurrently, we investigated the use of ecological niches via the isotopic signature of red blood cells indicating the trophic position (δ15N) and the spatial distribution (δ13C) of penguins. Handicapped birds performed ∼70% longer foraging trips and lost ∼60% more body mass than controls and their partners. However, corticosterone levels and the nutritional state were unchanged. The isotopic signature revealed that males and females differed in their foraging behaviour: upper trophic levels contributed more in the males' diet, who foraged in more pelagic areas. Handicapped and partner birds adopted the same strategy at sea: a shift towards higher δ13C values suggested that they foraged in more coastal areas than controls. This change in foraging decisions may optimize feeding time by decreasing travelling time. This may partly compensate for the presumed lower foraging efficiency of handicapped birds and for the energetic debt of their partners who had to fast ∼70% longer on the nest. We propose that this flexible use of ecological niches may allow birds facing increased breeding constraints to avoid chronic stress and to minimize the impact on their body condition."},{"title":"The distinction between retractor and protractor muscles of the freshwater snail's male organ has no physiological basis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/40","abstract":"Many animals are equipped with organs that can be everted, a notable example being male copulatory organs. The ability to protrude or evert an organ generally requires protractor and retractor muscles. Male copulatory behaviour of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis (L.) involves eversion (protraction) and retraction of the relatively large penis-carrying organ. For this preputium, protractor and retractor muscle bands have been defined, which implies eversion and retraction through the activity of these muscle bands. However, no physiological data are available that confirm that the terms protractor and retractor are appropriate. To test whether eversion and retraction are possible without protractor and/or retractor muscle bands, lesion experiments were performed. The results show that with either one or several muscle bands lesioned, snails were still capable of everting their preputium and using it for copulation. However, the majority of animals that had six or more muscle bands lesioned were unable to retract its preputium. Hence, retractor muscle bands serve their designated function whereas protractor muscle bands do not. We therefore suggest that a different terminology is used in which all muscle bands are retractors and, based on their location, are either called distal or proximal retractors. The findings furthermore indicate that the preputium muscle bands are normally contracted, possibly in a catch state, retaining the organ inside without high-energy expenditure."},{"title":"Lateral line diversity among ecologically divergent threespine stickleback populations","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/108","abstract":"The lateral line is a mechanoreceptive sensory system that allows fish to sense objects and motion in their local environment. Variation in lateral line morphology may allow fish in different habitats to differentially sense and respond to salient cues. Threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) occupy a diverse range of aquatic habitats; we therefore hypothesized that populations within the G. aculeatus species complex might show variation in the morphology of the lateral line sensory system. We sampled 16 threespine stickleback populations from marine, stream and lake (including benthic and limnetic) habitats and examined the distribution, type and number of neuromasts on different regions of the body. We found that the threespine stickleback has a reduced lateral line canal system, completely lacking canal neuromasts. Although the arrangement of lines of superficial neuromasts on the body was largely the same in all populations, the number of neuromasts within these lines varied across individuals, populations and habitats. In pairwise comparisons between threespine sticklebacks adapted to divergent habitats, we found significant differences in neuromast number. Stream residents had more neuromasts than marine sticklebacks living downstream in the same watershed. In two independent lakes, benthic sticklebacks had more trunk neuromasts than sympatric limnetic sticklebacks, providing evidence for parallel evolution of the lateral line system. Our data provide the first demonstration that the lateral line sensory system can vary significantly between individuals and among populations within a single species, and suggest that this sensory system may experience different selection regimes in alternative habitats."},{"title":"Individual variation and repeatability in aerobic and anaerobic swimming performance of European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/26","abstract":"Studies of inter-individual variation in fish swimming performance may provide insight into how selection has influenced diversity in phenotypic traits. We investigated individual variation and short-term repeatability of individual swimming performance by wild European sea bass in a constant acceleration test (CAT). Fish were challenged with four consecutive CATs with 5 min rest between trials. We measured maximum anaerobic speed at exhaustion (UCAT), gait transition speed from steady aerobic to unsteady anaerobic swimming (Ugt), routine metabolic rate (RMR), post-CAT maximum metabolic rate (MMR), aerobic scope and recovery time from the CATs. Fish achieved significantly higher speeds during the first CAT (UCAT=170 cm s–1), and had much more inter-individual variation in performance (coefficient of variation, CV=18.43%) than in the subsequent three tests (UCAT=134 cm s–1; CV=7.3%), which were very repeatable among individuals. The individual variation in UCAT in the first trial could be accounted for almost exclusively by variation in anaerobic burst-and-coast performance beyond Ugt. The Ugt itself varied substantially between individuals (CV=11.4%), but was significantly repeatable across all four trials. Individual RMR and MMR varied considerably, but the rank order of post-CAT MMR was highly repeatable. Recovery rate from the four CATs was highly variable and correlated positively with the first UCAT (longer recovery for higher speeds) but negatively with RMR and aerobic scope (shorter recovery for higher RMR and aerobic scope). This large variation in individual performance coupled with the strong correlations between some of the studied variables may reflect divergent selection favouring alternative strategies for foraging and avoiding predation."},{"title":"Gravikinesis in Stylonychia mytilus is based on membrane potential changes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/161","abstract":"The graviperception of the hypotrichous ciliate Stylonychia mytilus was investigated using electrophysiological methods and behavioural analysis. It is shown that Stylonychia can sense gravity and thereby compensates sedimentation rate by a negative gravikinesis. The graviresponse consists of a velocity-regulating physiological component (negative gravikinesis) and an additional orientational component. The latter is largely based on a physical mechanism but might, in addition, be affected by the frequency of ciliary reversals, which is under physiological control. We show that the external stimulus of gravity is transformed to a physiological signal, activating mechanosensitive calcium and potassium channels. Earlier electrophysiological experiments revealed that these ion channels are distributed in the manner of two opposing gradients over the surface membrane. Here, we show, for the first time, records of gravireceptor potentials in Stylonychia that are presumably based on this two-gradient system of ion channels. The gravireceptor potentials had maximum amplitudes of approximately 4 mV and slow activation characteristics (0.03 mV s–1).

The dolphin remained at the bottom depth for 90 s on each dive. Doppler and/or two-dimensional imaging ultrasound did not detect VGE in the portal and brachiocephalic veins following a dive series. Van Slyke analyses of serial, post-dive blood samples drawn from the fluke yielded blood nitrogen partial pressure (PN2) values that were negligibly different from control samples. Mean heart rate (HR; ±1 s.d.) recorded during diving was 50±3 beats min–1 and was not significantly different between the 50, 70 and 100 m dive sessions. The absence of VGE and elevated blood PN2 during post-dive periods do not support the hypothesis that N2 supersaturation during repetitive dives contributes to VGE formation in the dolphin. The diving HR pattern and the presumed rapid N2 washout during the surface-interval tachycardia probably minimized N2 accumulation in the blood during dive sessions."},{"title":"Slight differences in incubation temperature affect early growth and stress endocrinology of wood duck (Aix sponsa) ducklings","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/45","abstract":"Early developmental experiences, such as incubation conditions, can have important consequences for post-hatching fitness in birds. Although the effects of incubation temperature on phenotype of avian hatchlings are poorly understood, recent research suggests that subtle changes in incubation conditions can influence hatchling characteristics, including body size and condition. We designed an experiment to explore the effects of incubation temperature on hatching success, survival to 9 days post hatch, growth and the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis in wood ducks (Aix sponsa). Wood duck eggs were collected from nest boxes and experimentally incubated at three temperatures (35.0, 35.9 and 37.0°C), each falling within the range of temperatures of naturally incubated wood duck nests. Survival and growth were monitored in ducklings fed ad libitum for 9 days post hatch. In addition, baseline and stress-induced plasma corticosterone concentrations were measured in 2 and 9 day old ducklings. Hatching success and survival to 9 days was greatest in ducks incubated at the intermediate temperature. Ducklings incubated at 35.9°C and 37.0°C had 43% higher growth rates than ducklings incubated at 35.0°C.

We also found a significant negative correlation between body size and plasma corticosterone concentrations (baseline and stress-induced) in 9 day old ducklings. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that thermal conditions experienced during embryonic development can influence the HPA axis of young birds. Our results illustrate that subtle changes (<1.0°C) in the incubation environment can have important consequences for physiological traits important to fitness."},{"title":"In-line motion causes high thrust and efficiency in flapping foils that use power downstroke","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/63","abstract":"We show experimentally that flapping foil kinematics consisting of a power downstroke and a feathering upstroke together with a properly timed in-line motion, similar to those employed in forelimb propulsion of sea turtles, can produce high thrust and be hydrodynamically as efficient as symmetrically flapping foils. The crucial parameter for such asymmetrically flapping foils is a properly sized and timed in-line motion, whose effect is quantified by a new parameter, the advance angle, defined as the angle of the foil trajectory with respect to the horizontal, evaluated at the middle of the power downstroke. We show, in particular, that optimal efficiency in high aspect ratio rigid foils, accompanied by significant thrust production, is obtained for Strouhal numbers in the range 0.2–0.6 for Reynolds number equal to 13,000, and for values of the advance angle around 0.55π (100 deg.). The optimized kinematics consist of the foil moving back axially during the downstroke, in the direction of the oncoming flow, and rotating with a large pitch angle. This causes the force vector to rotate and become nearly parallel to the steady flow, thus providing a large thrust and a smaller transverse force. During the upstroke, the foil is feathering while it moves axially forward, i.e. away from the vorticity shed during the power stroke; as a result, the transverse force remains relatively small and no large drag force is produced. Observations from turtles confirm qualitatively the findings from the foil experiments."},{"title":"First evidence of fine colour discrimination ability in ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/72","abstract":"In the present study, we report the first evidence that ants discriminate and learn perceptually close colour stimuli. Foragers of the ant species Cataglyphis aenescens and Formica cunicularia were trained in a Y-maze choice apparatus to monochromatic light stimuli of a constant intensity associated with a food reward. Two stimuli, with a mean wavelength of 40 nm perceptual distance, were chosen from the UV (340 nm vs 380 nm) and the green (510 nm vs 550 nm) range because these species are UV–green dichromats. Foragers were trained with two conditioning paradigms [absolute conditioning (AC) and differential conditioning (DC)]. In the UV range, C. aenescens foragers failed to discriminate when presented with a small colour difference in both training procedures. Foragers also failed in the green range when trained with AC but showed significant bias towards the rewarded stimulus when trained with DC. Formica cunicularia foragers achieved the task in the UV range when trained with DC only. In the green range, F. cunicularia foragers showed clear preference for the rewarded stimulus in both training conditioning procedures. Foragers never failed in choosing the rewarded stimulus in DC even when the intensity of the rewarded stimulus was reduced by one log unit. This clearly indicates that DC is of paramount importance to discriminate perceptually close colour stimuli."},{"title":"Prioritizing blood flow: cardiovascular performance in response to the competing demands of locomotion and digestion for the Burmese python, Python molurus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/78","abstract":"Individually, the metabolic demands of digestion or movement can be fully supported by elevations in cardiovascular performance, but when occurring simultaneously, vascular perfusion may have to be prioritized to either the gut or skeletal muscles. Burmese pythons (Python molurus) experience similar increases in metabolic rate during the digestion of a meal as they do while crawling, hence each would have an equal demand for vascular supply when these two actions are combined. To determine, for the Burmese python, whether blood flow is prioritized when snakes are digesting and moving, we examined changes in cardiac performance and blood flow in response to digestion, movement, and the combination of digestion and movement. We used perivascular blood flow probes to measure blood flow through the left carotid artery, dorsal aorta, superior mesenteric artery and hepatic portal vein, and to calculate cardiac output, heart rate and stroke volume. Fasted pythons while crawling experienced a 2.7- and 3.3-fold increase, respectively, in heart rate and cardiac output, and a 66% decrease in superior mesenteric flow. During the digestion of a rodent meal equaling in mass to 24.7% of the snake's body mass, heart rate and cardiac output increased by 3.3- and 4.4-fold, respectively. Digestion also resulted in respective 11.6- and 14.1-fold increases in superior mesenteric and hepatic portal flow. When crawling while digesting, cardiac output and dorsal aorta flow increased by only 21% and 9%, respectively, a modest increase compared with that when they start to crawl on an empty stomach. Crawling did triggered a significant reduction in blood flow to the digesting gut, decreasing superior mesenteric and hepatic portal flow by 81% and 47%, respectively. When faced with the dual demands of digestion and crawling, Burmese pythons prioritize blood flow, apparently diverting visceral supply to the axial muscles."},{"title":"On the role of form and kinematics on the hydrodynamics of self-propelled body/caudal fin swimming","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/89","abstract":"We carry out fluid–structure interaction simulations of self-propelled virtual swimmers to investigate the effects of body shape (form) and kinematics on the hydrodynamics of undulatory swimming. To separate the effects of form and kinematics, we employ four different virtual swimmers: a carangiform swimmer (i.e. a mackerel swimming like mackerel do in nature); an anguilliform swimmer (i.e. a lamprey swimming like lampreys do in nature); a hybrid swimmer with anguilliform kinematics but carangiform body shape (a mackerel swimming like a lamprey); and another hybrid swimmer with carangiform kinematics but anguilliform body shape (a lamprey swimming like a mackerel). By comparing the performance of swimmers with different kinematics but similar body shapes we study the effects of kinematics whereas by comparing swimmers with similar kinematics but different body shapes we study the effects of form. We show that the anguilliform kinematics not only reaches higher velocities but is also more efficient in the viscous (Re∼102) and transitional (Re∼103) regimes. However, in the inertial regime (Re=∞) carangiform kinematics achieves higher velocities and is also more efficient than the anguilliform kinematics. The mackerel body achieves higher swimming speeds in all cases but is more efficient in the inertial regime only whereas the lamprey body is more efficient in the transitional regime. We also show that form and kinematics have little overall effect on the 3-D structure of the wake (i.e. single vs double row vortex streets), which mainly depends on the Strouhal number. Nevertheless, body shape is found to somewhat affect the small-scale features and complexity of the vortex rings shed by the various swimmers."},{"title":"Regulation of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) in turtle muscle and liver during acute exposure to anoxia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/17","abstract":"The freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta elegans naturally tolerates extended periods of anoxia during winter hibernation at the bottom of ice-locked ponds. Survival in this anoxic state is facilitated by a profound depression of metabolic rate. As calcium levels are known to be elevated in anoxic turtles, and ion pumping is an ATP-expensive process, we proposed that activity of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) would be reduced in muscle and liver of T. s. elegans during acute (up to 20 h) exposure to anoxia. SERCA activity decreased ∼30% in liver and ∼40% in muscle after 1 h anoxia exposure and was ∼50% lower after 20 h of anoxia exposure in both tissues, even though SERCA protein levels did not change. SERCA kinetic parameters (increased substrate Km values, increased Arrhenius activation energy) were indicative of a less active enzyme form under anoxic conditions. Interestingly, the less active SERCA in anoxic turtles featured greater stability than the enzyme from normoxic animals as determined by both kinetic analysis (effect of low pH and low temperatures on Km MgATP) and conformational resistance to urea denaturation. The quick time course of deactivation and the stable changes in kinetic parameters that resulted suggested that SERCA was regulated by a post-translational mechanism. In vitro experiments indicated that SERCA activity could be blunted by protein phosphorylation and enhanced by dephosphorylation in a tissue-specific manner."},{"title":"Fibre type-specific expression patterns of myosin heavy chain genes in adult torafugu Takifugu rubripes muscles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/137","abstract":"Comprehensive in silico studies, based on the total fugu genome database, which was the first to appear in fish, revealed that torafugu Takifugu rubripes contains 20 sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MYH) genes (MYH genes) (Ikeda et al., 2007). The present study was undertaken to identify MYH genes that would be expressed in adult muscles. In total, seven MYH genes were found by screening cDNA clone libraries constructed from fast, slow and cardiac muscles. Three MYH genes, fast-type MYHM86-1, slow-type MYHM8248 and slow/cardiac-type MYHM880, were cloned exclusively from fast, slow and cardiac muscles, respectively. Northern blot hybridization substantiated their specific expression, with the exception of MYHM880. In contrast, transcripts of fast-type MYHM2528-1 and MYHM1034 were found in both fast and slow muscles as revealed by cDNA clone library and northern blot techniques. This result was supported by in situ hybridization analysis using specific RNA probes, where transcripts of fast-type MYHM2528-1 were expressed in fast fibres with small diameters as well as in fibres of superficial slow muscle with large diameters adjacent to fast muscle. Transcripts of fast-type MYHM86-1 were expressed in all fast fibres with different diameters, whereas transcripts of slow-type MYHM8248 were restricted to fibres with small diameters located in a superficial part of slow muscle. Interestingly, histochemical analyses showed that fast fibres with small diameters and slow fibres with large diameters both contained acid-stable myofibrillar ATPase, suggesting that these fibres have similar functions, possibly in the generation of muscle fibres irrespective of their fibre types."},{"title":"Molt cycle regulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle of the blackback land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis, and the differential expression of a myostatin-like factor during atrophy induced by molting or unweighting","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/1/172","abstract":"In decapod crustaceans, claw muscle undergoes atrophy in response to elevated ecdysteroids while thoracic muscle undergoes atrophy in response to unweighting. The signaling pathways that regulate muscle atrophy in crustaceans are largely unknown. Myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle growth in mammals, and a myostatin-like cDNA is preferentially expressed in muscle of the land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis (Gl-Mstn). Contrary to prediction, levels of Gl-Mstn mRNA decreased dramatically in both the claw closer and weighted thoracic muscles when molting was induced by either eyestalk ablation (ESA) or multiple limb autotomy (MLA). However, the effect of molt induction was greater in the claw muscle. By late premolt, Gl-Mstn mRNA in the claw muscle decreased 81% and 94% in ESA and MLA animals, respectively, and was negatively correlated with ecdysteroids. Gl-Mstn mRNA in thoracic muscle decreased 68% and 82% in ESA and MLA animals, respectively, but was only weakly correlated with ecdysteroid. Claw and thoracic muscles also differed to varying extents in the expression of ecdysteroid receptor (Gl-EcR and Gl-RXR), elongation factor-2 (Gl-EF-2), and calpain T (Gl-CalpT) in response to molt induction, but levels of the four transcripts were not correlated with ecdysteroid. The downregulation of Gl-Mstn expression in premolt claw muscle coincided with 11- and 13-fold increases in protein synthesis in the myofibrillar and soluble protein fractions, respectively. Furthermore, the rate of the increase in the synthesis of soluble proteins was greater than that of myofibrillar proteins during early premolt (1.4:1, soluble:myofibrillar), but the two were equivalent during late premolt. By contrast, Gl-Mstn mRNA increased 3-fold and Gl-CalpT mRNA decreased 40% in unweighted thoracic muscle; there was little or no effect on Gl-EF-2, Gl-EcR, and Gl-RXR mRNA levels. These data indicate that Gl-Mstn expression is negatively regulated by both ecdysteroids and load-bearing contractile activity. The downregulation of Gl-Mstn in claw muscle may induce the elevated protein turnover associated with remodeling of the contractile apparatus during molt-induced atrophy. The upregulation of Gl-Mstn in unweighted thoracic muscle suggests that this factor is also involved in disuse atrophy when hemolymph ecdysteroid levels are low."}]
