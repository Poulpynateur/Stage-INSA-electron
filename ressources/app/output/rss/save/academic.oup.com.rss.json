By characterizing numerous physiological features of several lines of different cold sensitivity, we show that a combination of both avoidance and tolerance is involved. A novel avoidance mechanism was found that favored unhindered development of the photosynthetic apparatus through protection of the shoot apex below soil level due to a shortened mesocotyl.

Expression of AhFRDL1 induced by Fe deficiency was located in the root stele, but under Al-stress expression was observed across the entire root-tip cross-section.

However, only 1,2RhaT was directly linked to the accumulation of neohesperidoside, as demonstrated by association analysis of 50 accessions and co-segregation analysis of an F1 population derived from Citrus reticulata × Poncirus trifoliata. In transgenic tobacco BY2 cells, over-expression of CitdGlcTs resulted in flavonoid-7-O-glucosides being catalysed into bitterless flavonoid-7-O-di-glucosides, whereas over-expression of Cit1,2RhaT converted the same substrate into bitter-tasting flavonoid-7-O-neohesperidoside. Unlike 1,2RhaT, during citrus fruit development the dGlcTs showed an opposite expression pattern to CHS and CHI, two genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes of flavonoid biosynthesis. An uncoupled availability of dGlcTs and substrates might result in trace accumulation of flavonoid-7-O-di-glucosides in the fruit of C. maxima (pummelo).

In addition, cryptogein-induced increases in cAPX activity were suppressed in cells overexpressing NtCDC48 and the abundance of the cAPX dimer was below the level of detection. Furthermore, the levels of both reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and the GSH/GSSG ratio decreased more rapidly in response to the elicitor in these cells than in controls. A decrease in cAPX activity was also observed in response to heat shock in the cells overexpressing NtCDC48, indicating that the regulation of cAPX by NtCDC48 is not specific to the immune response.","authors":"Hervé Bègue, Angélique Besson-Bard, Cécile Blanchard, Pascale Winckler, Stéphane Bourque, Valérie Nicolas, David Wendehenne, Claire Rosnoblet","keywords":"Ascorbate peroxidase, CDC48, cryptogein, plant biochemistry, protein–protein interaction, redox regulation, tobacco","pub_date":"01 March 2019","title":"The chaperone-like protein CDC48 regulates ascorbate peroxidase in tobacco","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/10/2665/5367749?rss=1"},{"origin":"","abstract":"Functional–structural root-system models simulate the relations between root-system architectural and hydraulic properties, and the spatio-temporal distributions of water and solutes in the root zone.

Expression of AhFRDL1 induced by Fe deficiency was located in the root stele, but under Al-stress expression was observed across the entire root-tip cross-section.

True tolerance involved improved protection of the cell membrane against cold injury at temperatures close to 0 °C and stimulation of light-induced processes (accumulation of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and chlorophyll, proper development of chloroplasts) at temperatures in the range of 10–14 °C, likely also related to the increased photosensitivity and mediated by gibberellin signaling.","authors":"Marcin Grzybowski, Józef Adamczyk, Maciej Jończyk, Alicja Sobkowiak, Jarosław Szczepanik, Kamil Frankiewicz, Jan Fronk, Paweł Sowiński","keywords":"Avoidance, chloroplasts, early growth, gibberellins, light-induced processes, mesocotyl, photosynthetic apparatus, shoot apex, tolerance, Zea mays","pub_date":"02 March 2019","title":"Increased photosensitivity at early growth as a possible mechanism of maize adaptation to cold springs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/10/2887/5368539?rss=1"},{"origin":"","abstract":"The exploitation of diverse natural variation has been a key progenitor of crop breeding over the last decade. However, commercial practice is now turning to the use of accessions with less extreme phenotypes as genetic donors. In the present study, the carotenoid formation in a red-fruited discovery panel of Capsicum annuum (chilli pepper) has been characterized. The data indicated that colour intensity correlated with the amount of capsanthin and its esters, along with transcript levels of the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and phytoene synthase-1 (PSY-1) genes. Quantification of carotenoids through development and ripening suggested the presence of separate biosynthesis and accumulation phases. Subplastid fractionation demonstrated the differential sequestration of pigments in high- and low-intensity lines and revealed the PSY protein to be most active in the membrane fractions when abundance was highest in the fibril fractions. Carotenoid accumulation was associated with the esterification of xanthophylls, expression of a putative carotenoid acyl transferase, and increased fibril content within the plastid. Interrogation of TEM images and carotenoid analysis of subplastid fractions suggest that the plastoglobuli are likely to be the progenitor of the characteristic fibrils found in pepper fruit. Collectively, these data provide an insight into the underpinning molecular, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms associated with the synthesis and sequestration of carotenoids in chromoplast-containing fruits, in addition to providing potential tools and resources for the breeding of high red colour intensity pepper varieties.","authors":"Harriet M Berry, Daniel V Rickett, Charles J Baxter, Eugenia M A Enfissi, Paul D Fraser","keywords":"Capsicum, carotenoids, colour, isoprenoids, plastids, sequestration","pub_date":"01 March 2019","title":"Carotenoid biosynthesis and sequestration in red chilli pepper fruit and its impact on colour intensity traits","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/10/2637/5367528?rss=1"},{"origin":"","abstract":"MYB-type transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in plant growth and development, and in the responses to several abiotic stresses. In rice (Oryza sativa), the roles of MYB-related TFs in leaf senescence are not well documented. Here, we examined rice MYB TF gene OsMYB102 and found that an OsMYB102 T-DNA activation-tagged line (termed osmyb102-D), which constitutively expresses OsMYB102 under the control of four tandem repeats of the 35S promoter, and OsMYB102-overexpressing transgenic lines (35S:OsMYB102 and 35S:GFP-OsMYB102) maintain green leaves much longer than the wild-type under natural, dark-induced, and abscisic acid (ABA)-induced senescence conditions. Moreover, an osmyb102 knockout mutant showed an accelerated senescence phenotype under dark-induced and ABA-induced leaf senescence conditions. Microarray analysis showed that a variety of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) were down-regulated in the osmyb102-D line. Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB102 controls the expression of SAGs, including genes associated with ABA degradation and ABA signaling (OsABF4, OsNAP, and OsCYP707A6), under dark-induced senescence conditions. OsMYB102 inhibits ABA accumulation by directly activating the transcription of OsCYP707A6, which encodes the ABA catabolic enzyme ABSCISIC ACID 8′-HYDROXYLASE. OsMYB102 also indirectly represses ABA-responsive genes, such as OsABF4 and OsNAP. Collectively, these results demonstrate that OsMYB102 plays a critical role in leaf senescence by down-regulating ABA accumulation and ABA signaling responses.","authors":"Weilan Piao, Suk-Hwan Kim, Byoung-Doo Lee, Gynheung An, Yasuhito Sakuraba, Nam-Chon Paek","keywords":"Abscisic acid, chlorophyll degradation, leaf senescence, OsCYP707A6, OsMYB102, rice, senescence-associated genes, transcriptional regulation","pub_date":"02 March 2019","title":"Rice transcription factor OsMYB102 delays leaf senescence by down-regulating abscisic acid accumulation and signaling","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/10/2699/5368538?rss=1"},{"origin":"","abstract":"Lianas form long and flexible but disproportionately narrow stems, and thus require particular strategies to maintain the integrity of xylem water transport and ensure supply to large crown areas. The hydraulic architecture of lianas and the respective within-plant coordination of transport efficiency and safety, and the underlying anatomical variations in xylem, are largely unexplored. We analysed Hedera helix, a liana widespread in European temperate forests, with respect to hydraulic and xylem anatomical variations between the main stem and branches, between juvenile and adult life phases, and along the vertical axis. Main stems were significantly less embolism resistant but exhibited a higher hydraulic conductivity than branches. In branches, the cell turgor loss point of leaves decreased, while the embolism resistance and conductivity of xylem, as well as conduit diameters, increased with height. High water-transport capacities allow ivy to compensate for the small cross-section of stems, while the limited resistance to drought-induced xylem dysfunction of the main stem is probably linked to conservative stomatal regulation. Pronounced differences in xylem anatomy, hydraulic efficiency, and safety between the main stem and branches and along the vertical axis are surprisingly similar to those of self-supporting plants, and indicate that the coordination of carbon and water economies requires similar internal adjustments in tall plants.","authors":"Andrea Ganthaler, Katharina Marx, Barbara Beikircher, Stefan Mayr","keywords":"Climber, drought resistance, embolism, leaf dimorphism, osmotic adaptation, plant water relations, xylem anatomy","pub_date":"22 February 2019","title":"Are hydraulic patterns of lianas different from trees?

Our results not only confirmed the interaction between the proteins but also showed that it occurs in the cytosol. cAPX accumulation was modified in cells overexpressing NtCDC48, a process that was shown to involve post-translational modification of cAPX. In addition, cryptogein-induced increases in cAPX activity were suppressed in cells overexpressing NtCDC48 and the abundance of the cAPX dimer was below the level of detection. Furthermore, the levels of both reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and the GSH/GSSG ratio decreased more rapidly in response to the elicitor in these cells than in controls.

Time-series thermograms provided the basis for a spatial and temporal characterization of gsw responses in wheat (Triticum aestivum). A leaf replica with a known conductance was used to validate the approach and to test the ability of our model to be used with any material and under any environmental conditions. The results highlighted the importance of the co-ordinated stomatal responses that run parallel to the leaf blade despite their patchy distribution. The diversity and asymmetry of the temporal response of gsw observed after a step increase and step decrease in light intensity can be interpreted as a strategy to maximize photosynthesis per unit of water loss and avoid heat stress in response to light flecks in a natural environment.

Waterlogging leads to increased levels of AOS- and HPL-derived metabolites, and studies of genotypes lacking either one or both branches further support the key function of these oxylipins in waterlogging tolerance. Targeted quantitative metabolic profiling revealed oxylipin-dependent alterations in selected primary metabolites, and glycolytic and citric acid cycle intermediates, as well as a prominent shift in sucrose cleavage, hexose activation, the methionine salvage pathway, shikimate pathway, antioxidant system, and energy metabolism in genotypes differing in the presence of one or both functional branches of the oxylipin biosynthesis pathway. Interestingly, despite some distinct metabolic alterations caused specifically by individual branches, overexpression of HPL partially or fully alleviates the majority of altered metabolic profiles observed in AOS-depleted lines.

This is challenging because the flow and transport processes towards individual roots are hard to observe. In this study, we demonstrate how this problem can be addressed by combining co-registered root and tracer distributions obtained from magnetic resonance imaging with a root-system model in an inverse modeling scheme. The main features in the tracer distributions were well reproduced by the model using realistic root hydraulic parameters. By combining the functional–structural root-system model with 4D tracer observations, we were able to quantify the water uptake distribution of a growing root system. We determined that 76% of the transpiration was extracted through 3rd-order roots.

Expression of AhFRDL1 induced by Fe deficiency was located in the root stele, but under Al-stress expression was observed across the entire root-tip cross-section. Overexpression of AhFRDL1 restored efficient Fe translocation in Atfrd3 mutants and Al resistance in AtMATE-knockout mutants. Knocking down AhFRDL1 in the roots resulted in reduced xylem citrate and reduced concentrations of active Fe in young leaves. Furthermore, AhFRDL1-knockdown lines had reduced root citrate exudation and were more sensitive to Al toxicity. Compared to an Al-sensitive variety, enhanced AhFRDL1 expression in an Fe-efficient variety contributed to higher levels of Al tolerance and Fe translocation by promoting citrate secretion. These results indicate that AhFRDL1 plays a significant role in Fe translocation and Al tolerance in Fe-efficient peanut varieties under different soil-stress conditions.
