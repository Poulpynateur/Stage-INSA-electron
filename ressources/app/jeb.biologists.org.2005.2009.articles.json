Changes occurring during drying could damage molecules, including DNA. Using the anhydrobiotic tardigrade Paramacrobiotus richtersi as a model organism, we have evaluated the effects of environmental factors, such as temperature and air humidity level (RH), on the survival of desiccated animals and on the degradation of their DNA. Tardigrades naturally desiccated in leaf litter and tardigrades experimentally desiccated on blotting paper were considered. Replicates were kept at 37°C and at different levels of RH for 21 days. RH values and temperature, as well as time of exposure to these environmental factors, have a negative effect on tardigrade survival and on the time required by animals to recover active life after desiccation. DNA damages (revealed as single strand breaks) occurred only in desiccated tardigrades kept for a long time at high RH values. These results indicate that during the anhydrobiotic state, damages take place and accumulate with time. Two hypotheses can be formulated to explain the results: (i) oxidative damages occur in desiccated specimens of P. richtersi, and (ii) high temperatures and high RH values change the state of the disaccharide trehalose, reducing its protective role."},{"title":"The mechanical properties of red deer antler bone when used in fighting","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/3985","abstract":"We assessed the hydration state of antlers and its effect on antler mechanical properties compared with wet femur. Red deer antlers were removed from the head at various times, from a few days after velvet shedding till late in the season, and weighed weekly until after casting time. Antlers cut just after losing their velvet lost weight rapidly in the first few weeks, then settled down and changed weight very little, the latter changes correlating with air relative humidity. Antlers cut later showed little weight change at any time. The water content of cortical and trabecular parts of the contralateral antler was assessed after cutting. Most of the weight loss was from the cancellous, not the cortical, part of the antler. Wet and dry specimens from the antlers, and wet specimens from deer femora, were tested mechanically. Compared with wet bone, wet antler had a much lower modulus of elasticity and bending strength, but a higher work to fracture. Compared with wet bone, dry antler showed a somewhat lower Young's modulus, but a considerably higher bending strength and a much higher work to fracture. The impact energy absorption of dry antler was much greater than that of wet bone. In red deer, the antler is effectively dry during its use in fights, at least in southern Spain. In addition, dry antler, compared with ordinary bone, shows mechanical properties that suit it admirably for its fighting function."},{"title":"The cost of assuming the life history of a host: acoustic startle in the parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/4056","abstract":"In the obligatory reproductive dependence of a parasite on its host, the parasite must trade the benefit of ‘outsourcing’ functions like reproduction for the risk of assuming hazards associated with the host. In the present study, we report behavioral adaptations of a parasitic fly, Ormia ochracea, that resemble those of its cricket hosts. Ormia females home in on the male cricket's songs and deposit larvae, which burrow into the cricket, feed and emerge to pupate. Because male crickets call at night, gravid female Ormia in search of hosts are subject to bat predation, in much the same way as female crickets are when responding to male song. We show that Ormia has evolved the same evasive behavior as have crickets: an acoustic startle response to bat-like ultrasound that manifests clearly only during flight. Furthermore, like crickets, Ormia has a sharp response boundary between the frequencies of song and bat cries, resembling categorical perception first described in the context of human speech."},{"title":"Testing the role of sensory systems in the migratory heading of a songbird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/4065","abstract":"The identification of the sensory cues and mechanisms by which migratory birds are able to reach the same breeding and wintering grounds year after year has eluded biologists despite more than 50 years of intensive study. While a number of environmental cues have been proposed to play a role in the navigation of birds, arguments still persist about which cues are essential for the experience based navigation shown by adult migrants. To date, few studies have tested the sensory basis of navigational cues used during actual migration in the wild: mainly laboratory based studies or homing during the non-migratory season have been used to investigate this behaviour. Here we tested the role of olfactory and magnetic cues in the migration of the catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) by radio tracking the migration of birds with sensory manipulations during their actual migratory flights. Our data suggest that adult birds treated with zinc sulphate to produce anosmia were unable to show the same orientation as control adults, and instead reverted to a direction similar to that shown by juveniles making their first migration. The magnetic manipulation had no effect on the orientation of either adults or juveniles. These results allow us to propose that the olfactory sense may play a role in experience based migration in adult catbirds. While the olfactory sense has been shown to play a role in the homing of pigeons and other birds, this is the first time it has been implicated in migratory orientation."},{"title":"The morphology of the masticatory apparatus facilitates muscle force production at wide jaw gapes in tree-gouging common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/4040","abstract":"Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) generate wide jaw gapes when gouging trees with their anterior teeth to elicit tree exudate flow. Closely related cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) do not gouge trees but share similar diets including exudates. Maximizing jaw opening theoretically compromises the bite forces that marmosets can generate during gouging. To investigate how jaw-muscle architecture and craniofacial position impact muscle performance during gouging, we combine skull and jaw-muscle architectural features to model muscle force production across a range of jaw gapes in these two species. We incorporate joint mechanics, resting sarcomere length and muscle architecture estimates from the masseter and temporalis to model muscle excursion, sarcomere length and relative tension as a function of joint angle. Muscle excursion from occlusion to an estimated maximum functional gape of 55 deg. was smaller in all regions of the masseter and temporalis of C. jacchus compared with S. oedipus except the posterior temporalis. As a consequence of reduced muscle excursion distributed over more sarcomeres in series (i.e. longer fibers), sarcomere length operating ranges are smaller in C. jacchus jaw muscles across this range of gapes. This configuration allows C. jacchus to act on a more favorable portion of the length—tension curve at larger gapes and thereby generate relatively greater tension in these muscles compared with S. oedipus. Our results suggest that biting performance during tree gouging in common marmosets is improved by a musculoskeletal configuration that reduces muscle stretch at wide gapes while simultaneously facilitating comparatively large muscle forces at the extremes of jaw opening."},{"title":"Distinct freshwater and seawater isoforms of Na+/K+-ATPase in gill chloride cells of Atlantic salmon","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/3994","abstract":"Gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) in teleost fishes is involved in ion regulation in both freshwater and seawater. We have developed and validated rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to the NKA α1a and α1b protein isoforms of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Linnaeus), and used western blots and immunohistochemistry to characterize their size, abundance and localization. The relative molecular mass of NKA α1a is slightly less than that for NKA β1b. The abundance of gill NKA α1a was high in freshwater and became nearly undetectable after seawater acclimation. NKA α1b was present in small amounts in freshwater and increased 13-fold after seawater acclimation. Both NKA isoforms were detected only in chloride cells. NKA α1a was located in both filamental and lamellar chloride cells in freshwater, whereas in seawater it was present only as a faint background in filamental chloride cells. In freshwater, NKA α1b was found in a small number of filamental chloride cells, and after seawater acclimation it was found in all chloride cells on the filament and lamellae. Double simultaneous immunofluorescence indicated that NKA α1a and α1b are located in different chloride cells in freshwater. In many chloride cells in seawater, NKA α1b was present in greater amounts in the subapical region than elsewhere in the cell. The combined patterns in abundance and immunolocalization of these two isoforms can explain the salinity-related changes in total NKA and chloride cell abundance. The results indicate that there is a freshwater and a seawater isoform of NKA α-subunit in the gills of Atlantic salmon and that they are present in distinct chloride cells."},{"title":"Elastic energy storage in the mantis shrimp's fast predatory strike","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/4002","abstract":"Storage of elastic energy is key to increasing the power output of many biological systems. Mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda) must store considerable elastic energy prior to their rapid raptorial strikes; however, little is known about the dynamics and location of elastic energy storage structures in this system. We used computed tomography (CT) to visualize the mineralization patterns in Gonodactylaceus falcatus and high speed videography of Odontodactylus scyllarus to observe the dynamics of spring loading. Using a materials testing apparatus, we measured the force and work required to contract the elastic structures in G. falcatus. There was a positive linear correlation between contraction force and contraction distance; alternative model tests further supported the use of a linear model. Therefore, we modeled the system as a Hookean spring. The force required to fully compress the spring was positively correlated with body mass and appendage size, but the spring constant did not scale with body size, suggesting a possible role of muscle constraints in the scaling of this system. One hypothesized elastic storage structure, the saddle, only contributed approximately 11% of the total measured force, thus suggesting that primary site of elastic energy storage is in the mineralized ventral bars found in the merus segment of the raptorial appendages. Furthermore, the intact system exhibited 81% resilience and severing the saddle resulted in a non-significant reduction to 77% resilience. The remarkable shapes and mineralization patterns that characterize the mantis shrimp's raptorial appendage further reveal a highly integrated mechanical power amplification system based on exoskeletal elastic energy storage."},{"title":"Sea turtles compensate deflection of heading at the sea surface during directional travel","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/4019","abstract":"Air-breathing marine animals, including sea turtles, utilise two fundamentally different environments (i.e. sea surface and underwater) during migration. Many satellite telemetry studies have shown travel paths at relatively large spatio-temporal scales, discussing the orientation and navigation mechanisms that guide turtles. However, as travel paths obtained by satellite telemetry only reflect movements at the surface, little is known about movements and orientation ability underwater. In this study, to assess orientation ability both at the surface and underwater, fine-scale 3-D movements of free-ranging loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta were reconstructed by using multi-sensor data loggers. Video systems (‘Crittercam’) were also used to record the behaviour of the turtles and the visual information surrounding the turtles. During August and October in 2006 and 2007, eight turtles were released from Otsuchi Bay, Japan (39°20′30N, 141°56′00E), and a total of 118 h of 3-D movements were reconstructed. Turtles maintained highly straight-line courses (straightness index >0.95) during 41% of the total duration (i.e. ‘travelling periods’). During travelling periods, turtles swam continuously, maintaining unidirectional heading throughout dives whereas turtles changed heading remarkably at the surface. Despite highly directional movements during dives, travel direction tended to shift by the end of dives lasting 10 minutes or more. Such deflections seemed to be compensated during subsequent surfacing periods because there was a negative relationship between changes in travel direction arising during dives and subsequent surfacing periods. Therefore, remarkable changes in heading at the surface could be interpreted as direction-searching behaviour. Our results suggested that turtles undertaking directional travel were more dependent on directional information that was reliable at the surface."},{"title":"Structural and proteomic analyses reveal regional brain differences during honeybee aging","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/4027","abstract":"Among insects, learning is particularly well studied in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the honeybee Apis mellifera. A senescence-dependent decline in classic pavlovian conditioning is demonstrated for both species. To understand how aging affects learning, genetic approaches used with Drosophila can benefit from complementary studies in Apis. Specifically, honeybees have a larger brain size allowing for compartment-specific approaches, and a unique life-history plasticity. They usually perform within-nest tasks early in life (nest bees) and later they collect food (foragers). Senescence of learning performance is a function of the bees' foraging duration but underlying causes are poorly understood. As cognitive aging is commonly associated with structural and biochemical changes in the brain, we hypothesized that brain areas implicated in learning change in synaptic and biochemical composition with increased foraging duration. First, we used synapse-specific immunohistochemistry and proteomics to screen for alterations in the calyx region of the mushroom body, a key structure for memory formation. Using proteomics, we next profiled the central brain, which comprises all higher-order integration centers. We show that, with increased foraging duration, levels of kinases, synaptic- and neuronal growth-related proteins decline in the central brain while the calyx region remains intact both in structure and biochemistry. We suggest that proteome-level changes within major anatomical sites of memory formation other than the calyx region could be central to learning dysfunction. These include large compartments of the central brain, such as the mushroom body's output regions and the antennal lobes. Our data provide novel information toward heterogeneity in the aging insect brain, and demonstrate advantages of the honeybee for invertebrate neurogerontological research."},{"title":"Comparative feeding kinematics and performance of odontocetes: belugas, Pacific white-sided dolphins and long-finned pilot whales","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/3939","abstract":"Cetaceans are thought to display a diversity of feeding modes that are often described as convergent with other more basal aquatic vertebrates (i.e. actinopterygians). However, the biomechanics of feeding in cetaceans has been relatively ignored by functional biologists. This study investigated the feeding behavior, kinematics and pressure generation of three odontocetes with varying feeding modes (belugas, Delphinapterus leucas; Pacific white-sided dolphins, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens; and long-finned pilot whales, Globicephala melas). Four feeding phases were recognized in all odontocetes: (I) preparatory, (II) jaw opening, (III) gular depression, and (IV) jaw closing. Belugas relied on a feeding mode that was composed of discrete ram and suction components. Pacific white-sided dolphins fed using ram, with some suction for compensation or manipulation of prey. Pilot whales were kinematically similar to belugas but relied on a combination of ram and suction that was less discrete than belugas. Belugas were able to purse the anterior lips to occlude lateral gape and form a small, circular anterior aperture that is convergent with feeding behaviors observed in more basal vertebrates. Suction generation in odontocetes is a function of hyolingual displacement and rapid jaw opening, and is likely to be significantly enhanced by lip pursing behaviors. Some degree of subambient pressure was measured in all species, with belugas reaching 126 kPa. Functional variations of suction generation during feeding demonstrate a wider diversity of feeding behaviors in odontocetes than previously thought. However, odontocete suction generation is convergent with that of more basal aquatic vertebrates."},{"title":"Multiple photoreceptor systems control the swim pacemaker activity in box jellyfish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/3951","abstract":"Like all other cnidarian medusae, box jellyfish propel themselves through the water by contracting their bell-shaped body in discrete swim pulses. These pulses are controlled by a swim pacemaker system situated in their sensory structures, the rhopalia. Each medusa has four rhopalia each with a similar set of six eyes of four morphologically different types. We have examined how each of the four eye types influences the swim pacemaker. Multiple photoreceptor systems, three of the four eye types, plus the rhopalial neuropil, affect the swim pacemaker. The lower lens eye inhibits the pacemaker when stimulated and provokes a strong increase in the pacemaker frequency upon light-off. The upper lens eye, the pit eyes and the rhopalial neuropil all have close to the opposite effect. When these responses are compared with all-eye stimulations it is seen that some advanced integration must take place."},{"title":"The effects of water temperature on the energetic costs of juvenile and adult California sea lions (Zalophus californianus): the importance of skeletal muscle thermogenesis for thermal balance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/3977","abstract":"As highly mobile marine predators, many pinniped species routinely encounter a wide range of water temperatures during foraging and in association with seasonal, geographical and climatic changes. To determine how such variation in environmental temperature may impact energetic costs in otariids, we determined the thermal neutral zone of adult and juvenile California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) by measuring resting metabolic rate using open-flow respirometry. Five adult female (body mass range =82.2-107.2 kg) and four juvenile (body mass=26.2-36.5 kg) sea lions were examined over experimental water temperatures ranging from 0 to 20°C (adults) or 5 to 20°C (juveniles). The metabolic rate of adult sea lions averaged 6.4±0.64 ml O2 kg−1 min−1 when resting within the thermal neutral zone. The lower critical temperature of adults was 6.4±2.2°C, approximately 4°C lower than sea surface temperatures routinely encountered off coastal California. In comparison, juvenile sea lions did not demonstrate thermal neutrality within the range of water temperatures examined. Resting metabolic rate of the younger animals, 6.3±0.53 ml O2 kg−1 min−1, increased as water temperature approached 12°C, and suggested a potential thermal limitation in the wild. To determine whether muscle thermogenesis during activity could mitigate this limitation, we measured the active metabolic rate of juveniles swimming at water temperature (Twater)=5, 12 and 20°C. No significant difference (F=0.377, P=0.583) in swimming metabolic rate was found among water temperatures, suggesting that thermal disadvantages due to small body size in juvenile sea lions may be circumvented by recycling endogenous heat during locomotor activity."},{"title":"The peptide hormone pQDLDHVFLRFamide (crustacean myosuppressin) modulates the Homarus americanus cardiac neuromuscular system at multiple sites","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/24/3961","abstract":"pQDLDHVFLRFamide is a highly conserved crustacean neuropeptide with a structure that places it within the myosuppressin subfamily of the FMRFamide-like peptides. Despite its apparent ubiquitous conservation in decapod crustaceans, the paracrine and/or endocrine roles played by pQDLDHVFLRFamide remain largely unknown. We have examined the actions of this peptide on the cardiac neuromuscular system of the American lobster Homarus americanus using four preparations: the intact animal, the heart in vitro, the isolated cardiac ganglion (CG), and a stimulated heart muscle preparation. In the intact animal, injection of myosuppressin caused a decrease in heartbeat frequency. Perfusion of the in vitro heart with pQDLDHVFLRFamide elicited a decrease in the frequency and an increase in the amplitude of heart contractions. In the isolated CG, myosuppressin induced a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential of cardiac motor neurons and a decrease in the cycle frequency of their bursting. In the stimulated heart muscle preparation, pQDLDHVFLRFamide increased the amplitude of the induced contractions, suggesting that myosuppressin modulates not only the CG, but also peripheral sites. For at least the in vitro heart and the isolated CG, the effects of myosuppressin were dose-dependent (10−9 to 10−6 mol l−1 tested), with threshold concentrations (10−8−10−7 mol l−1) consistent with the peptide serving as a circulating hormone. Although cycle frequency, a parameter directly determined by the CG, consistently decreased when pQDLDHVFLRFamide was applied to all preparation types, the magnitudes of this decrease differed, suggesting the possibility that, because myosuppressin modulates the CG and the periphery, it also alters peripheral feedback to the CG."},{"title":"Brood pheromone suppresses physiology of extreme longevity in honeybees (Apis mellifera)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3795","abstract":"Honeybee (Apis mellifera) society is characterized by a helper caste of essentially sterile female bees called workers. Workers show striking changes in lifespan that correlate with changes in colony demography. When rearing sibling sisters (brood), workers survive for 3-6 weeks. When brood rearing declines, worker lifespan is 20 weeks or longer. Insects can survive unfavorable periods on endogenous stores of protein and lipid. The glyco-lipoprotein vitellogenin extends worker bee lifespan by functioning in free radical defense, immunity and behavioral control. Workers use vitellogenin in brood food synthesis, and the metabolic cost of brood rearing (nurse load) may consume vitellogenin stores and reduce worker longevity. Yet, in addition to consuming resources, brood secretes a primer pheromone that affects worker physiology and behavior. Odors and odor perception can influence invertebrate longevity but it is unknown whether brood pheromone modulates vitellogenin stores and survival. We address this question with a 2-factorial experiment where 12 colonies are exposed to combinations of absence vs presence of brood and brood pheromone. Over an age-course of 24 days, we monitor the amount of vitellogenin stored in workers' fat body (adipose tissue). Thereafter, we track colony survival for 200 days. We demonstrate that brood rearing reduces worker vitellogenin stores and colony long-term survival. Yet also, we establish that the effects can result solely from exposure to brood pheromone. These findings indicate that molecular systems of extreme lifespan regulation are integrated with the sensory system of honeybees to respond to variation in a primer pheromone secreted from larvae."},{"title":"Spatial distribution of opsin-encoding mRNAs in the tiered larval retinas of the sunburst diving beetle Thermonectus marmoratus (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3781","abstract":"Larvae of the sunburst diving beetle, Thermonectus marmoratus, have a cluster of six stemmata (E1-6) and one eye patch on each side of the head. Each eye has two retinas: a distal retina that is closer to the lens, and a proximal retina that lies directly underneath. The distal retinas of E1 and E2 are made of a dorsal and a ventral stack of at least twelve photoreceptor layers. Could this arrangement be used to compensate for lens chromatic aberration, with shorter wavelengths detected by the distal layers and longer wavelengths by the proximal layers? To answer this question we molecularly identified opsins and their expression patterns in these eyes. We found three opsin-encoding genes. The distal retinas of all six eyes express long-wavelength opsin (TmLW) mRNA, whereas the proximal retinas express ultraviolet opsin (TmUV I) mRNA. In the proximal retinas of E1 and E2, the TmUV I mRNA is expressed only in the dorsal stack. A second ultraviolet opsin mRNA (TmUV II), is expressed in the proximal retinas of E1 and E2 (both stacks). The finding that longer-wavelength opsins are expressed distally to shorter-wavelength opsins makes it unlikely that this retinal arrangement is used to compensate for lens chromatic aberration. In addition, we also described opsin expression patterns in the medial retina of E1 and in the non-tiered retina of the lensless eye patch. To our knowledge, this is also the first report of multiple UV opsins being expressed in the same stemma."},{"title":"Isoform- and cell-specific function of tyrosine decarboxylase in the Drosophila Malpighian tubule","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3802","abstract":"The biogenic amine tyramine (TA) is a potent diuretic factor when applied to the Malpighian tubule (MT) of Drosophila melanogaster, stimulating both urine production and transepithelial chloride conductance. Isolated MTs can respond not only to TA but also to its precursor, tyrosine; this observation led to the proposal that MTs are able to synthesize TA from applied tyrosine through the action of the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC). In the current study it is shown that the non-neuronal isoform of TDC, Tdc1, is expressed in the principal cells of the MT. A mutant allele of Tdc1, Tdc1f03311, was identified that reduced expression of the mature Tdc1 transcript by greater than 100-fold. MTs isolated from Tdc1f03311 homozygous flies showed no significant depolarization of their transepithelial potential (TEP) or diuresis in response to tyrosine while retaining normal sensitivity to TA. By contrast, a previously identified null mutant allele of the neuronal TDC isoform Tdc2 had no effect on either tyrosine or TA sensitivity. To determine in which cell type of the MT Tdc1 expression is required, flies were generated carrying a UAS-Tdc1 transgene and cell-type-specific Gal4 drivers on a Tdc1f03311 homozygous background. Rescue of Tdc1 expression in principal cells fully restored sensitivity to tyrosine whereas expression of Tdc1 in stellate cells had no rescuing effect. It is concluded that synthesis of TA by Tdc1 in the principal cells of the MT is required for physiological responses to tyrosine. TA synthesis in the MT is the first reported physiological role for Drosophila Tdc1."},{"title":"Interspecific and intersexual learning rate differences in four butterfly species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3810","abstract":"Learning plays an important role in food acquisition for a wide range of insects and has been demonstrated to be essential during flower foraging in taxa such as bees, parasitoid wasps, butterflies and moths.

We examined the associative learning of flower colour with nectar in four butterfly species: Idea leuconoe, Argyreus hyperbius, Pieris rapae and Lycaena phlaeas. All butterflies that were trained learned the flower colours associated with food. The flower colour learning rates were significantly higher in I. leuconoe and A. hyperbius than in P. rapae and L. phlaeas. Among the four species examined, the larger and longer-lived species exhibited higher learning rates. Furthermore, female butterflies showed a significantly higher learning rate than males. This study provides the first evidence that learning abilities related to floral cues differ among butterfly species. The adaptive significance of superior learning abilities in the larger and longer-lived butterfly species and in females is discussed."},{"title":"Perception of airborne odors by loggerhead sea turtles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3823","abstract":"Sea turtles are known to detect chemical cues, but in contrast to most marine animals, turtles surface to breathe and thus potentially have access to olfactory cues both in air and in water. To determine whether sea turtles can detect airborne chemical cues, captive loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) were placed into a circular, water-filled arena in which odorants could be introduced to the air above the water surface. Air that had passed across the surface of a cup containing food elicited increased activity, diving and other behavior normally associated with feeding. By contrast, air that had passed across the surface of an identical cup containing distilled water elicited no response. Increases in activity during food odor trials occurred only after turtles surfaced to breathe and peaked in the first post-breath minute, implying that the chemical cues eliciting the responses were unlikely to have been detected while the turtles were under water. These results provide the first direct evidence that sea turtles can detect airborne odors. Under natural conditions, this sensory ability might function in foraging, navigation or both."},{"title":"Vocally correlated seasonal auditory variation in the house sparrow (Passer domesticus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3817","abstract":"Songbirds exhibit seasonal plasticity in a broad variety of behavioral and morphological traits associated with reproduction. Changes in song production are well described while changes in song reception are not. In the present study, we test for seasonal variation in auditory processing of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus L.) using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to tone bursts. We measured amplitude and latency of the first ABR peak in spring, summer and autumn at stimulus frequencies from 0.8 to 6.4 kHz and intensity levels from 24 to 80 dB SPL. ABR thresholds were determined at each frequency using cross-correlation. Amplitude was greater in spring than in autumn at frequencies from 3.2 to 6.4 kHz whereas latency and thresholds exhibited no seasonal variation. The results indicate an increase in the number or temporal synchrony of responses from peripheral auditory neurons during the early breeding season. Changes in peripheral auditory processing may enhance temporal coding of the fine structure and envelope of song; thereby, improving assessment of encoded information in both sexes (e.g. individual identity and dominance status) and auditory feedback during song production in males. Peripheral auditory changes may be mediated by reproductive hormones, and could involve changes in hair cell density on the basilar papilla. Our results suggest that peripheral auditory processing of songbirds changes seasonally in parallel with other behavioral and morphological traits, such as song production."},{"title":"The freshwater Amazonian stingray, Potamotrygon motoro, up-regulates glutamine synthetase activity and protein abundance, and accumulates glutamine when exposed to brackish (15‰) water","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3828","abstract":"This study aimed to examine whether the stenohaline freshwater stingray, Potamotrygon motoro, which lacks a functional ornithine—urea cycle, would up-regulate glutamine synthetase (GS) activity and protein abundance, and accumulate glutamine during a progressive transfer from freshwater to brackish (15‰) water with daily feeding. Our results revealed that, similar to other freshwater teleosts, P. motoro performed hyperosmotic regulation, with very low urea concentrations in plasma and tissues, in freshwater. In 15‰ water, it was non-ureotelic and non-ureoosmotic, acting mainly as an osmoconformer with its plasma osmolality, [Na+] and [Cl−] comparable to those of the external medium. There were significant increases in the content of several free amino acids (FAAs), including glutamate, glutamine and glycine, in muscle and liver, but not in plasma, indicating that FAAs could contribute in part to cell volume regulation. Furthermore, exposure of P. motoro to 15‰ water led to up-regulation of GS activity and protein abundance in both liver and muscle. Thus, our results indicate for the first time that, despite the inability to synthesize urea and the lack of functional carbamoyl phosphate synthetase III (CPS III) which uses glutamine as a substrate, P. motoro retained the capacity to up-regulate the activity and protein expression of GS in response to salinity stress. Potamotrygon motoro was not nitrogen (N) limited when exposed to 15‰ water with feeding, and there were no significant changes in the amination and deamination activities of hepatic glutamate dehydrogenase. In contrast, P. motoro became N limited when exposed to 10‰ water with fasting and could not survive well in 15‰ water without food."},{"title":"Carbonic anhydrase expression and CO2 excretion during early development in zebrafish Danio rerio","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3837","abstract":"Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is critical for CO2 excretion in adult fish, but little is known of the expression or function of CA during early development. The present study examined the hypothesis that, as rates of CO2 production increased during early development in zebrafish (Danio rerio), CA would become necessary for effective CO2 excretion, and that the pattern of CA expression during early development would reflect this transition. Real-time RT-PCR was used to examine the mRNA expression of the two main intracellular CA isoforms over a time course of early development ranging from 0 to 120 h post fertilization (h.p.f.). The mRNA expression of zCAb was generally higher than that of zCAc, particularly during the earliest stages of development. Rates of CO2 excretion increased approximately 15-fold from 24 to 48 h.p.f. whereas rates of O2 uptake increased only 6.7-fold over the same period, indicating a relative stimulation of CO2 excretion over O2 uptake. Treatment of 48 h.p.f. larvae with the CA inhibitor acetazolamide resulted in CO2 excretion rates that were 52% of the value in control larvae, a significant difference that occurred in the absence of any effect on O2 uptake. Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides were used to selectively knock down one or both of the main intracellular CA isoforms. Subsequent measurement of gas transfer rates at 48 h.p.f. indicated that CA knockdown caused a significant relative inhibition of CO2 excretion over O2 uptake, regardless of which cytosolic CA isoform was targeted for knockdown. These results suggest that between 24 h.p.f. and 48 h.p.f., developing zebrafish begin to rely on CA to meet requirements for increased CO2 excretion."},{"title":"The responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to high external ammonia and urea transporter inhibition: nitrogen excretion and expression of rhesus glycoproteins and urea transporter proteins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3846","abstract":"While adult zebrafish, Danio rerio, possess ammonia and urea transporters (Rh and UT proteins, respectively) in a number of tissues, they are most heavily concentrated within the gills.

HEA increased mRNA levels for a number of Rh proteins in embryos and larvae but did not elicit similar effects in adult gills, which appear to compensate for the unfavourable ammonia excretory gradient by increasing expression of V-type H+-ATPase. Phloretin exposure increased UT mRNA levels in embryos and larvae but was without effect in adult gill tissue. Surprisingly, in both adults and juveniles, HEA increased the mRNA expression of UT and phloretin increased the mRNA expression of Rh proteins. These results imply that, in zebrafish, there may be a tighter link between ammonia and urea excretion than is thought to occur in most teleosts."},{"title":"Photosensitivity to different light intensities in blind and sighted rodents","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3857","abstract":"Photoperiod is an important cue regulating biological rhythms in mammals, including ‘blind’ subterranean and sighted fossorial rodent species. These species may respond differentially to changes in light quality according to their retinal complexity. The effects of increasing light intensity on daily rhythms of urine excretion and urinary output of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels were compared in ‘blind’ mole rats Spalax ehrenbergi and sighted social voles, Microtus socialis. Our results show that the threshold irradiance required to entrain rhythms of voles is three magnitudes greater than that for mole rats. The results suggest that mole rats have an operational photoreceptive pathway with a lower threshold irradiance than voles. Such a low threshold reflects the remarkable capability of this ‘blind’ species to utilize light signals even under challenging light conditions."},{"title":"Fatty acid composition of pectoralis muscle membrane, intramuscular fat stores and adipose tissue of migrant and wintering white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3865","abstract":"The fatty acid composition of muscle membrane phospholipids and fat stores may affect migration performance in birds. The purpose of this study was to investigate seasonal changes in the fatty acid composition of (1) pectoralis muscle phospholipids, (2) intramuscular triglyceride stores and (3) adipose tissue triglycerides in free-living white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis). During migratory seasons there was an increase in the n-6:n-3 ratio of muscle membrane phospholipid fatty acids without a change in the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. This change was driven mainly by an increase in the proportion of 18:2n-6 and a decrease in the proportion of 22:6n-3. An increase in the proportion of 18:2n-6 was also observed in the intramuscular and adipose tissue triglyceride stores during the migratory seasons. These increases in 18:2n-6 were offset by a decrease in 16:0; resulting in an elevated proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and elevated double bond index in both fat stores of migrants. The elevated levels of 18:2n-6 in migrant fat stores indicates a high dietary component of this fatty acid, as white-throated sparrows feed mainly on tree seeds and some insects during migration and may not have access to a diet high in n-3 fatty acids. We suspect that elevated dietary levels of 18:2n-6 also caused the observed increases in the proportion of this fatty acid in muscle phospholipids. Overall, we conclude that seasonal changes in adipose and muscle fatty acid composition are likely attributable to diet more than other factors such as migratory exercise or mitochondrial density."},{"title":"The intestinal response to feeding in seawater gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta, includes elevated base secretion and increased epithelial oxygen consumption","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3873","abstract":"Intestinal HCO3− secretion is essential to marine teleost fish osmoregulation and comprises a considerable source of base efflux attributable to both serosal HCO3− and endogenous CO2 hydration. The role of intestinal HCO3− secretion in dynamic acid—base balance regulation appears negligible in studies of unfed fish, but evidence of high intestinal fluid [HCO3−] in fed marine teleosts led us to investigate the source of this HCO3− and its potential role in offsetting the postprandial ‘alkaline tide’ commonly associated with digestion. Specifically, we hypothesized that elevated metabolic rate and thus endogenous CO2 production by intestinal tissue as well as increased transepithelial intestinal HCO3− secretion occur post-feeding and offset a postprandial alkaline tide. To test these hypotheses changes in HCO3− secretion and O2 consumption by gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) isolated intestine were quantified 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h post-feeding. Intestinal tissue of unfed fish in general showed high rates of HCO3− secretion (15.5 μmol g−1 h−1) and O2 consumption (8.9 μmol g−1 h−1). Furthermore, postprandial increases in both intestinal HCO3− secretion and O2 consumption (1.6- and 1.9-fold peak increases, respectively) were observed. Elevated intestinal HCO3− secretion rates preceded and outlasted those of O2 consumption, and occurred at a magnitude and duration sufficient to account for the lack of alkaline tide. The dependence of these high rates of postprandial intestinal base secretion on serosal HCO3− indicates transepithelial HCO3− transport increases disproportionately more than endogenous CO2 production. The magnitude of postprandial intestinal HCO3− secretion indicates the intestine certainly is capable of postprandial acid#x02014;base balance regulation."},{"title":"Passive maintenance of high angle of attack and its lift generation during flapping translation in crane fly wing","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3882","abstract":"We have studied the passive maintenance of high angle of attack and its lift generation during the crane fly's flapping translation using a dynamically scaled model. Since the wing and the surrounding fluid interact with each other, the dynamic similarity between the model flight and actual insect flight was measured using not only the non-dimensional numbers for the fluid (the Reynolds and Strouhal numbers) but also those for the fluid—structure interaction (the mass and Cauchy numbers). A difference was observed between the mass number of the model and that of the actual insect because of the limitation of available solid materials. However, the dynamic similarity during the flapping translation was not much affected by the mass number since the inertial force during the flapping translation is not dominant because of the small acceleration. In our model flight, a high angle of attack of the wing was maintained passively during the flapping translation and the wing generated sufficient lift force to support the insect weight. The mechanism of the maintenance is the equilibrium between the elastic reaction force resulting from the wing torsion and the fluid dynamic pressure. Our model wing rotated quickly at the stroke reversal in spite of the reduced inertial effect of the wing mass compared with that of the actual insect. This result could be explained by the added mass from the surrounding fluid. Our results suggest that the pitching motion can be passive in the crane fly's flapping flight."},{"title":"Differences in LTM-forming capability between geographically different strains of Alberta Lymnaea stagnalis are maintained whether they are trained in the lab or in the wild","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3911","abstract":"We found strain differences in the ability of wild Alberta Lymnaea stagnalis to form long-term memory (LTM) following operant conditioning when L. stagnalis were collected from the wild and trained in the laboratory. Lymnaea stagnalis obtained from the Belly River watershed had an enhanced ability to form LTM compared with those from an isolated pond (referred to as Jackson snails). We therefore asked whether the differences in cognitive ability were an epiphenomenon as a result of training in the laboratory. To answer this question we trained each specific strain (Belly and Jackson) in both the laboratory and the field (i.e. in their home pond and in the pond where the other strain resided - referred to as the visitor pond). We found that within each strain there was no difference in the LTM phenotype whether they were trained in the lab or in either their home or visitor pond. That is, the strain differences in the ability to form LTM were still present. Interestingly, we found no strain differences in the ability to learn or the ability to form intermediate-term memory (ITM)."},{"title":"Ventilatory and cardiovascular actions of centrally and peripherally administered trout pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in the unanaesthetized trout","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3919","abstract":"In mammals, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are involved in cardiovascular and respiratory regulation. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of PACAP, VIP and their receptors in various tissues of teleost fish, including the brain, but little is known about their respiratory and cardiovascular effects. The present study was undertaken to compare the central and peripheral actions of graded doses (25-100 pmol) of trout PACAP and trout VIP on ventilatory and cardiovascular variables in the unanaesthetized rainbow trout. Compared with vehicle, only intracerebroventricular injection of PACAP significantly (P<0.05) elevated the ventilation frequency and the ventilation amplitude, but both peptides significantly increased the total ventilation (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/212/23/3919/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>).

When injected centrally, only PACAP produced a significant increase in mean dorsal aortic blood pressure (PDA) (100 pmol: +21%) but neither peptide affected heart rate (fH). Intra-arterial injections of either PACAP or VIP were without effect on the ventilatory variables. PACAP was without significant action on PDA and fH while VIP significantly elevated PDA (100 pmol: +36%) without changing fH. In conclusion, the selective central hyperventilatory actions of exogenously administered trout PACAP, and to a lesser extent VIP, suggest that the endogenous peptides may be implicated in important neuroregulatory functions related to the central control of ventilation in trout."},{"title":"Thermal learning in the honeybee, Apis mellifera","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3928","abstract":"Honeybee foragers are exposed to thermal stimuli when collecting food outside and receiving food rewards inside the nest. In both contexts, there is an opportunity for foragers to associate warmth with food rewards. However, honeybee thermal learning is poorly understood. Using an associative learning paradigm (the proboscis extension reflex), we show that honeybees can learn to associate a nectar reward with a heated stimulus applied to the antenna to mimic natural contact with a warm flower or nectar-offering forager. Conditioning with longer inter-trial intervals (ITI) significantly improved learning acquisition. We also trained bees to discriminate between temperatures above (warm) and below (cold) ambient air temperature. Learning acquisition improved by 38% per 10°C increase in absolute stimulus intensity (difference between the rewarded temperature and unrewarded ambient air temperature). However, bees learned positive temperature (warm) significantly better than negative temperature (cold) differences, approximately twice as well for 10°C as compared with a −10°C difference. Thus, thermosensation, a sensory modality that is relatively unexplored in honeybees, could play a role in the acquisition of information from nestmates (social learning) and in foraging decisions influenced by associations between floral temperature and nectar rewards."},{"title":"Cell kinetics of the marine sponge Halisarca caerulea reveal rapid cell turnover and shedding","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3892","abstract":"This study reveals the peculiar in vivo cell kinetics and cell turnover of the marine sponge Halisarca caerulea under steady-state conditions. The tropical coral reef sponge shows an extremely high proliferation activity, a short cell cycle duration and massive cell shedding. Cell turnover is predominantly confined to a single cell population, i.e. the choanocytes, and in this process apoptosis only plays a minor role. To our knowledge, such fast cell kinetics under steady-state conditions, with high turnover by shedding in the absence of apoptosis, has not been observed previously in any other multicellular organism. The duration of the cell cycle in vivo resembles that of unicellular organisms in culture. Morphological and histochemical studies demonstrate compartmentalization of choanocytes in the sponge tissue, which corresponds well with its remarkable cellular kinetics. Coral reef cavity sponges, like H. caerulea, inhabit low nutrient tropical waters, forcing these organisms to filter large volumes of water and to capture the few nutrients efficiently. Under these oligotrophic conditions, a high cell turnover may be considered as a very useful strategy, preventing permanent damage to the sponge by environmental stress. Halisarca caerulea maintains its body mass and keeps its food uptake system up to date by constantly renewing its filter system. We conclude that studies on cell kinetics and functional morphology provide new and essential information on the growth characteristics and the regulation of sponge growth in vivo as well as in vitro and the role of choanocytes in tissue homeostasis."},{"title":"Characterization of the sea bass melanocortin 5 receptor: a putative role in hepatic lipid metabolism","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/23/3901","abstract":"The melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R) plays a key role in the regulation of exocrine secretion in mammalian species. This receptor has also been characterized in some fish species but its function is unknown. We report the molecular and pharmacological characterization, as well as the tissue expression pattern, of sea bass MC5R. Cloning of five active alleles showing different levels of sensitivity to endogenous melanocortin and one non-functional allele demonstrate the allelic complexity of the MC5R locus. The sea bass receptor was activated by all the melanocortins tested, with ACTH and desacetyl-MSH and β-MSH showing the lowest efficiency. The acetylation of the MSH isoforms seems to be critical for the effectiveness of the agonist. Agouti-related protein had no effect on basal or agonist-stimulated activation of the receptor. SbMC5R was mainly expressed in the brain but lower expression levels were found in several peripheral tissues, including liver. Progressive fasting did not induce up- or downregulation of hypothalamic MC5R expression, suggesting that central MC5R is not involved in the regulation of food intake in the sea bass. MTII, a sbMC5R agonist, stimulated hepatic lipolysis in vitro, measured as free fatty acid release into the culture medium after melanocortin agonist exposure of liver fragments, suggesting that MC5R is involved in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism. Taken together, the data suggest that different allelic combinations may confer differential sensitivity to endogenous melanocortin in tissues where MC5R is expressed and, by extension, in hepatic lipid metabolism."},{"title":"The intensity threshold of colour vision in two species of parrot","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/22/3693","abstract":"We have used behavioural tests to determine the intensity thresholds of\ncolour vision in Bourke's parrots (Neopsephotus bourkii) and\nbudgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus).

Additionally, eye rotation and head yaw were quantified to determine if species compensate for large blind areas anterior to the head. The winghead shark possessed the largest anterior binocular overlap (48 deg.) and was nearly four times larger than that of the lemon (10 deg.) and blacknose (11 deg.) sharks. The binocular overlap in the scalloped hammerhead sharks (34 deg.) was greater than the bonnethead sharks (13 deg.) and carcharhinid species; however, the bonnethead shark did not differ from the carcharhinids. These results indicate that binocular overlap has increased with lateral head expansion in hammerhead sharks. The hammerhead species did not demonstrate greater eye rotation in the anterior or posterior direction. However, both the scalloped hammerhead and bonnethead sharks exhibited greater head yaw during swimming (16.9 deg. and 15.6 deg., respectively) than the lemon (15.1 deg.) and blacknose (15.0 deg.) sharks, indicating a behavioral compensation for the anterior blind area. This study illustrates the larger binocular overlap in hammerhead species relative to their carcharhinid sister taxa and is consistent with the ‘enhanced binocular field’ hypothesis."},{"title":"The role of signalling molecules on actin glutathionylation and protein\ncarbonylation induced by cadmium in haemocytes of mussel Mytilus\ngalloprovincialis (Lmk)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/22/3612","abstract":"This study investigated the role of Na+/H+ exchanger\n(NHE) and signalling molecules, such as cAMP, PKC, PI 3-kinase, and immune\ndefence enzymes, NADPH oxidase and nitric oxide synthase, in the induction of\nprotein glutathionylation and carbonylation in cadmium-treated haemocytes of\nmussel Mytilus galloprovincialis.

Previous research suggests that in adults, maximum power\nproduction in jumping is related to lower limb stiffness. In a developmental\ncontext, the question arises as to whether the relationship between maximum\npower production and lower limb stiffness is age-dependent. The purpose of\nthis study was to investigate the relationship between lower limb stiffness\nand peak power production in adolescents (AD) and pre-adolescents (PA). With\ninstitutional approval, two groups of pre-adults (pre-adolescents: 11–13\nyears of age, N=43; adolescents: 16–18 years of age,\nN=30) performed 30 two-legged hops at their preferred frequency and\nthree maximum counter-movement jumps. AD produced significantly greater peak\npower during the counter-movement jump than PA\n(t71=–5.28, P<0.001) even when body mass\nwas accounted for. Lower limb stiffness was significantly correlated with peak\npower production during the counter-movement jump in AD (R=0.62,\nP<0.001) but not in PA (R=0.26, P=0.10). When\nnormalised to body mass, the relationship between lower limb stiffness and\npeak power also differed between the two age groups (R=0.30,\nP=0.11 for AD and R=0.02, P=0.88 for PA). In\naddition, we found that during hopping, both PA and AD behaved like a simple\nspring-mass system. Our findings highlight the importance of lower limb\nstiffness in the context of muscular power production during multi-joint\ntasks.

It is therefore a good candidate for testing\nthe effects of bird defences against feather-degrading microorganisms. One of\nthese defences is the oil secreted by the uropygial gland, which birds use to\nprotect their feathers against parasites. In previous studies we have shown\nhow Enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from nestling hoopoes\nexert antagonistic effects against B. licheniformis, mediated by the\nproduction of bacteriocins. Consequently we hypothesized that this\nenterococcus and the bacteriocins it engenders might act as a defence against\nfeather-degrading microorganisms in hoopoes. We investigated this hypothesis\nin a series of laboratory experiments and evaluated the extent to which the\nkeratinolytic effects caused by B. licheniformis were reduced by the\nE. faecalis MRR10-3 strain, isolated from hoopoes, and its\nbacteriocins.

To test these predictions, in\nvivo patterns of muscle activation, strain, and strain rate were compared\nusing electromyography and sonomicrometry in two major elbow extensors, the\nlong and lateral heads of the triceps brachii of goats (Capra\nhircus), across a range of speed (1–5 m s–1) and\ngait. Muscle recordings were synchronized to limb kinematics using high-speed\ndigital video imaging (250 Hz). Measurements obtained from four goats\n(25–45 kg) showed that the monoarticular lateral head exhibited a\nstretch-shortening pattern (6.8±0.6% stretch and–\n10.6±2.7% shortening; mean ± s.e.m. for all speeds and\ngaits) after being activated, which parallels the flexion–extension\npattern of the elbow. By contrast, the biarticular long head shortened through\nmost of stance (–16.4±3.4%), despite elbow flexion in the first\nhalf and shoulder extension in the last half of stance. The magnitude of elbow\nflexion and shoulder extension increased with increasing speed (ANCOVA,\nP<0.05 and P<0.001), as did the magnitude and rate of\nactive stretch of fascicles in the lateral head (P<0.001 for\nboth).

Few independent effects of gait were\nfound. In contrast to its expected function, the biarticular long head appears\nto produce positive work throughout stance, whereas the monoarticular lateral\nhead appears to absorb work at the elbow. The biarticular anatomy of the long\nhead may mitigate increases in muscle strain with speed in this muscle,\nbecause strain magnitude in the second phase of stance (when the shoulder\nextends) decreased with speed (P<0.05)."},{"title":"Waiting time before release increases the motivation to home in homing\npigeons (Columba livia)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/20/3361","abstract":"When performing homing experiments with individual releases, pigeons have\nto wait in a transport box for a certain amount of time before being released\nand hence perceive the departure of companions.

Using eggs of the sphingid moth\nManduca sexta, we show that longitudinal tracheae in embryos fill\nwith gas in less than 5 s, without invasion of external air, by a process of\ncavitation. Cavitation requires that tracheal liquids be under tension, and we\npropose two complementary processes for generating it. One likely, classical\nmechanism is tracheolar fluid absorption, first proposed by Wigglesworth. Our\ndata support this mechanism in Manduca: after cavitation, liquids are\nprogressively drawn out of finer tracheal branches. The second, previously\nunknown, mechanism is evaporative water loss across the eggshell, which leads\nboth to declining egg volume and to a larger negative pressure potential of\nwater. The pressure potential helps to drive rapid expansion of small bubbles\nnucleated near spiracles. Once bubbles are large enough to have displaced\nliquid across the diameter of a trachea, negative capillary pressure\nreinforces subsequent expansion of the bubble. Together with predictions from\nmodern cavitation theory, our observations substantiate Wigglesworth's\ncontention that gas filling is promoted by increasing hydrophobicity\nassociated with tanning of the spiracles and major tracheal branches."},{"title":"Aphid watery saliva counteracts sieve-tube occlusion: a universal phenomenon?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/20/3305","abstract":"Ca2+-binding proteins in the watery saliva of Megoura\nviciae counteract Ca2+-dependent occlusion of sieve plates in\nVicia faba and so prevent the shut-down of food supply in response to\nstylet penetration.

In the present paper, hover flight including body oscillations is\nsimulated by coupling the equations of motion with the Navier–Stokes\nequations. The equations are solved numerically; periodical solutions\nrepresenting the hover flight are obtained by the shooting method. Two model\ninsects are considered, a dronefly and a hawkmoth; the former has relatively\nhigh wingbeat frequency (n) and small wing mass to body mass ratio,\nwhilst the latter has relatively low wingbeat frequency and large wing mass to\nbody mass ratio. The main results are as follows. (i) The body mainly has a\nhorizontal oscillation; oscillation in the vertical direction is about 1/6 of\nthat in the horizontal direction and oscillation in pitch angle is relatively\nsmall. (ii) For the hawkmoth, the peak-to-peak values of the horizontal\nvelocity, displacement and pitch angle are 0.11U (U is the\nmean velocity at the radius of gyration of the wing), 0.22c=4 mm\n(c is the mean chord length) and 4 deg., respectively. For the\ndronefly, the corresponding values are 0.02U, 0.05c=0.15 mm\nand 0.3 deg., much smaller than those of the hawkmoth. (iii) The horizontal\nmotion of the body decreases the relative velocity of the wings by a small\namount. As a result, a larger angle of attack of the wing, and hence a larger\ndrag to lift ratio or larger aerodynamic power, is required for hovering,\ncompared with the case of neglecting body oscillations. For the hawkmoth, the\nangle of attack is about 3.5 deg. larger and the specific power about 9%\nlarger than that in the case of neglecting the body oscillations; for the\ndronefly, the corresponding values are 0.7 deg. and 2%. (iv) The horizontal\noscillation of the body consists of two parts; one (due to wing aerodynamic\nforce) is proportional to 1/cn2 and the other (due to wing\ninertial force) is proportional to wing mass to body mass ratio. For many\ninsects, the values of 1/cn2 and wing mass to body mass\nratio are much smaller than those of the hawkmoth, and the effects of body\noscillation would be rather small; thus it is reasonable to neglect the body\noscillations in studying their aerodynamics."},{"title":"The role of experience in flight behaviour of Drosophila","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/20/3377","abstract":"Experience plays a key role in the acquisition of complex motor skills in\nrunning and flight of many vertebrates.

These naive animals\nwere compared with control flies under both open- and closed-loop tethered\nflight conditions in a flight simulator as well as in a free-flight arena. The\ndata suggest that the overall flight behaviour in Drosophila seems to\nbe predetermined because both groups exhibited similar mean stroke amplitude\nand stroke frequency, similar open-loop responses to visual stimulation and\nthe immediate ability to track visual objects under closed-loop feedback\nconditions. In short free flight bouts, peak saccadic turning rate, angular\nacceleration, peak horizontal speed and flight altitude were also similar in\nnaive and control flies. However, we found significant changes in other key\nparameters in naive animals such as a reduction in mean horizontal speed\n(–23%) and subtle changes in mean turning rate (–48%). Naive flies\nproduced 25% less yaw torque-equivalent stroke amplitudes than the controls in\nresponse to a visual stripe rotating in open loop around the tethered animal,\npotentially suggesting a flight-dependent adaptation of the visuo-motor gain\nin the control group. This change ceased after the animals experienced visual\nclosed-loop feedback. During closed-loop flight conditions, naive flies had\n53% larger differences in left and right stroke amplitude when fixating a\nvisual object, thus steering control was less precise. We discuss two\nalternative hypotheses to explain our results: the `neuronal experience'\nhypothesis, suggesting that there are some elements of learning and\nfine-tuning involved during the first flight experiences in\nDrosophila and the `muscular exercise' hypothesis. Our experiments\nsupport the first hypothesis because maximum locomotor capacity seems not to\nbe significantly impaired in the naive group.

Surprisingly, the daphnids showed\ndifferent allocation strategies with regard to temperature and dietary sterol\navailability. The cholesterol content of eggs was enhanced at higher\ntemperature, which suggested that females allocate more cholesterol to their\noffspring, presumably to ensure sufficient egg development. When dietary\ncholesterol was limiting, however, females did not allocate more cholesterol\nto their eggs. Our data suggest that during cyanobacterial blooms, a potential\ndietary sterol limitation of Daphnia can be intensified at higher\nwater temperatures, which can occur with global warming."},{"title":"Heterothermy in small, migrating passerine birds during stopover: use of hypothermia at rest accelerates fuel accumulation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/19/3068","abstract":"For small endothermic animals, heterothermy serves as an energy-saving\nmechanism for survival in challenging environments, but it may also accelerate\nfat accumulation in individuals preparing for fuel-demanding activities.

While monitoring body temperature (Tb) of\neight blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) by radiotelemetry, we found that\nduring daytime Tb=42.5±0.4°C (mean ±\ns.d.); at night Tb decreased to a minimum between 33 and\n40°C.

In\nbirds of body mass (mb) <16.3 g, minimum\nTb at night correlated with the individual's\nmb (r=0.67, P<0.01, N=17),\nbut this was not the case in birds with mb>16.3 g.\nMinimum nocturnal Tb did not correlate with night-time air\ntemperature (Ta). Measurements of metabolic rate in birds\nsubjected to a Ta of 15°C showed that hypothermia of\nthis magnitude can lead to a reduction of some 30% in energy expenditure\ncompared with birds remaining normothermic. Our data suggest that by reducing\nthe Tb–Ta gradient, blackcaps\naccelerate their rate of fuel accumulation at a stopover. When body energy\nreserves are low blackcaps may achieve this reduction by entering hypothermia.\nSince hypothermia, as seen in blackcaps, may lead to significant energy\nsavings and facilitate body mass gain, we predict that it is common among\nsmall migrating passerines."},{"title":"The influence of ambient temperature and thermal acclimation on hearing in a eurythermal and a stenothermal otophysan fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/19/3091","abstract":"Being ectothermic, fish body temperature generally depends on ambient water\ntemperature. Thus, ambient temperature might affect various sensory systems,\nincluding hearing, as a result of metabolic and physiological processes.\nHowever, the maintenance of sensory functions in a changing environment may be\ncrucial for an animal's survival. Many fish species rely on hearing for\nacoustic orientation and communication. In order to investigate the influence\nof temperature on the auditory system, channel catfish Ictalurus\npunctatus was chosen as a model for a eurytherm species and the tropical\ncatfish Pimelodus pictus as a model for a stenotherm fish. Hearing\nsensitivity was measured with animals acclimated or unacclimated to different\nwater temperatures. Ambient water temperature significantly influenced hearing\nthresholds and the shape of auditory evoked potentials, especially at higher\nfrequencies in I. punctatus. Hearing sensitivity of I.\npunctatus was lowest at 10°C and increased by up to 36 dB between\n10°C and 26°C. Significant differences were also revealed between\nacclimated and unacclimated animals after an increase in water temperature but\nnot a decrease. By contrast, differences in hearing thresholds were smaller in\nP. pictus, even if a similar temperature difference (8°C) was\nconsidered. However, P. pictus showed a similar trend as I.\npunctatus in exhibiting higher hearing sensitivity at the highest tested\ntemperature, especially at the highest frequency tested. The results therefore\nsuggest that the functional temperature dependence of sensory systems may\ndiffer depending upon whether a species is physiologically adapted to tolerate\na wide or narrow temperature range."},{"title":"Flexible clap and fling in tiny insect flight","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/19/3076","abstract":"Of the insects that have been filmed in flight, those that are 1 mm in\nlength or less often clap their wings together at the end of each upstroke and\nfling them apart at the beginning of each downstroke. This `clap and fling'\nmotion is thought to augment the lift forces generated during flight. What has\nnot been highlighted in previous work is that very large forces are required\nto clap the wings together and to fling the wings apart at the low Reynolds\nnumbers relevant to these tiny insects. In this paper, we use the immersed\nboundary method to simulate clap and fling in rigid and flexible wings. We\nfind that the drag forces generated during fling with rigid wings can be up to\n10 times larger than what would be produced without the effects of\nwing–wing interaction. As the horizontal components of the forces\ngenerated during the end of the upstroke and beginning of the downstroke\ncancel as a result of the motion of the two wings, these forces cannot be used\nto generate thrust. As a result, clap and fling appears to be rather\ninefficient for the smallest flying insects. We also add flexibility to the\nwings and find that the maximum drag force generated during the fling can be\nreduced by about 50%.

Recent data\nhave shown that, in inexperienced pigeons, section of the ophthalmic branch of\nthe trigeminal nerve does not impair navigational abilities. Similarly, no\nimpairment was observed if the trigeminal section was performed on young\npigeons, before they have had the opportunity to learn a navigational map. By\ncontrast, section of the olfactory nerve either in adult inexperienced pigeons\nor in young birds before map learning, disrupted their homing performance.\nNevertheless, because a magnetic map mechanism requires training flights for\nlearning the magnetic gradient of the territory around the loft, the question\nremains as to whether the navigational performance of adult experienced\npigeons can be affected by lack of magnetic information. To answer this\nquestion we extensively group-trained adult pigeons and then surgically\ndeprived them of either olfactory or trigeminally mediated magnetic\ninformation, prior to testing their navigational abilities. The birds deprived\nof trigeminally mediated magnetic information displayed similar navigational\nabilities as intact control pigeons, whereas the olfactory-deprived pigeons\nwere dramatically impaired in homing.

Elevated hibernation\ntemperatures (i.e. 10°C versus 5°C) significantly increased\noverall melatonin and decreased corticosterone concentrations of snakes. The\ntemperature-induced differences in melatonin rhythms between the 5°C and\n10°C treatment groups persisted even after both groups were again\nacclimated to 10°C, indicating that cold temperature exposure has a\nlasting influence on melatonin rhythms. Elevated hibernation temperatures also\nsignificantly altered androgen and corticosterone profiles of snakes,\nproviding a potential mechanism to explain reported annual variation in\nsteroid hormones. Although previous studies indicate that male red-sided\ngarter snakes exhibit a dissociated reproductive strategy, we demonstrate the\npresence of intersexual variation in sex steroid hormone profiles, as\nestradiol concentrations of female snakes increased significantly prior to\nspring mating activity. Importantly, the percentage change in body mass did\nnot differ significantly between snakes in the hibernation treatments,\nindicating that the observed changes in hormone profiles are indeed\ntemperature induced and not simply an indirect result of significant changes\nin the energy balance of snakes. Finally, in males maintained at 10°C\nduring winter dormancy the onset of courtship behavior following emergence was\ndelayed.

A flow-through system, designed to maintain a sufficient food\nsupply and minimize the accumulation of metabolites, was used. To eliminate\nthe effect of infochemicals from crowded animals, a single-individual\ntreatment flask was connected to two crowded flasks. In the first generation,\nD. pulex reared under crowded conditions grew more slowly after day 4\nwhen oogenesis normally starts, and produced less offspring after day 9,\ncompared with an animal reared alone, even when supplied with sufficient food.\nAlthough second generation daphniids of each treatment matured faster than in\nthe first generation, crowded females grew more slowly even after day 2 and\nproduced less offspring than single females. Age to maturity was no different\nbetween treatments in both generations. Crowded females, therefore, matured to\nsmaller sizes but produced larger neonates compared with single females.\nWeight-specific reproduction rates of the first clutch were not significantly\ndifferent between the treatments. These results suggest that physical\ninterference between neighboring individuals due to crowding negatively\naffects growth and reproduction in daphniids.

As a consequence, males and females have\nusually different fitness optimization strategies which may give rise to\nsexual conflict. Since simultaneous hermaphrodites have, in theory, the option\nto mate as male or as female at any time, conflict will occur if partners\ninsist in taking the same role. Several lines of evidence exists that body\nsize influences gender choice. However, growth in many invertebrates is\nindeterminate and therefore age is generally a covariant of size. We therefore\ninvestigated the effect of age on mating choices in the simultaneous\nhermaphrodite Lymnaea stagnalis. Using fully sexually mature animals\nsampled from three different age groups we show that copulation frequency\ndeclines with age. Specifically, in age-matched couples the frequency of\nprimary and reciprocal copulations declines with age. Furthermore, the younger\npartner tends to mate as male with greater probability in couples of unequal\nage. Size was never a factor in the sex role preference of Lymnaea.\nThus, young Lymnaea always attempt to copulate as male independent of\nthe age of their partner, whereas senior snails act primarily as female. The\nsex role choices of middle-aged snails appear to depend on their partner's\nage. In addition, we demonstrate that the likelihood that an animal will\ncopulate as male is not correlated with prostate gland size but correlates\nwith the level of afferent electrical activity recorded in the nerve\noriginating in the prostate gland.

We analysed porpoise\necholocation behaviour leading up to and following prey capture events,\nincluding variability in echolocation in response to vision restriction, prey\nspecies, and individual porpoise tested. The porpoises produced echolocation\nclicks as they searched for the fish, followed by fast-repetition-rate clicks\n(echolocation buzzes) when acquiring prey. During buzzes, which usually began\nwhen porpoises were about 1–2 body lengths from prey, tag-recorded click\nlevels decreased by about 10 dB, click rates increased to over 300 clicks per\nsecond, and variability in body orientation (roll) increased. Buzzes generally\ncontinued beyond the first contact with the fish, and often extended until or\nafter the end of prey handling. This unexplained continuation of buzzes after\nprey capture raises questions about the function of buzzes, suggesting that in\naddition to providing detailed information on target location during the\ncapture, they may serve additional purposes such as the relocation of\npotentially escaping prey.

Our results further show that\nexperimental birds faced a reduced adrenocortical response compared with\ncontrol birds, thus for the first time implying that geomagnetic cues trigger\nchanges in hormonal secretion enabling appropriate behaviour along the\nmigratory route."},{"title":"Estimation of homing distance in desert ants, Cataglyphis\nfortis, remains unaffected by disturbance of walking behaviour","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/18/2893","abstract":"Desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, use a stride integrator as a\ndistance gauge in their well-studied path integration system (while a skylight\ncompass provides the direction gauge).

First, legs that contribute to one of the two\nleg tripods alternately used in normal walking were selectively amputated.\nThis prevented the normal tripod gait and should interfere with both the\nnormal walking programme controlled by the central nervous system, and normal\nsensory feedback from the legs. Second, manipulation of the walking substrate\nin the form of regular corrugations was observed to interfere with normal\nwalking behaviour, at least for corrugation wavelengths (12–25 mm) in\nthe range of normal stride lengths. The animals fell and stumbled, or footfall\npatterns were entrained to the corrugation wavelength. The relationship\nbetween stride length and stride frequency was altered in several situations.\nSurprisingly, distance estimation and homing performance remained virtually\nunaffected even by the most severe interferences with walking behaviour.

During migratory seasons, mRNA expression of\nthese genes increased 70–1000% above wintering levels, while protein\nexpression of H-FABP and FABPpm increased 43% and 110% above wintering levels.\nActivities of key metabolic enzymes, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (HOAD),\ncarnitine palmitoyl transferase II (CPT II), and citrate synthase (CS) also\nincreased (90–110%) in pectoralis muscles of migrant birds.

Here, we use black goby (Gobius niger) to test\nthe hypothesis that a postural curvature caused by a bending response (i.e. a\nslow muscle contraction which bends the body with no forward displacement)\ninduced by a weak stimulus (WS) may affect escape responses. Three experiments\nwere carried out. (1) Control and WS-stimulated fish were startled using\nlateral mechanical stimuli, to test whether the orientation of the postural\nC-bend affected escape direction and performance. Postural curvature was\ndefined as positive when escapes were towards the convex side of the postural\nC-shape, and negative when they were towards the concave side. Locomotor\nperformance increased with postural curvature, although fish showed a\npreference for escaping away from the stimulus regardless of postural\ncurvature.

By escaping from positively curved\npostures, most of the initial tailsweep is directed backwards and may provide\nmore thrust than when starting from straight or negatively curved postures.\nHence, the anti-predator posture adopted by alerted benthic fishes may\n`prepare' them for their subsequent escape response because it conveys an\nadvantage when they are attacked from above (a likely occurrence), although\nwhen gobies are stimulated horizontally, escape direction may be favoured over\nhigh locomotor performance when the two trade off."},{"title":"Orientation of lizards in a Morris water-maze: roles of the sun compass and the parietal eye","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/18/2918","abstract":"The present study examined for the first time whether a Morris water-maze\ncan be used to explore compass and other orientation mechanisms in the ruin\nlizard Podarcis sicula.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that all\nretinal quadrants had increased accumulation of TRβ transcripts\n2 days post-T4 treatment, corresponding to initiation of SWS1 opsin\ndownregulation. Smolts exhibited decreased accumulation of TRα\nand TRβ transcripts in all quadrants, but this effect was most\npronounced in the dorso-temporal (DT) retinal quadrant where UVS cones\npersist.

Therefore, further studies are needed\nto better understand (1) how baseline CORT levels are functionally regulated\naccording to energetic status and energetic demands and (2) to what extent\nCORT can be used to aid in the conservation of seabird populations."},{"title":"Jumping performance of planthoppers (Hemiptera, Issidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/17/2844","abstract":"The structure of the hind limbs and the kinematics of their movements that\npropel jumping in planthopper insects (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha,\nFulgoroidea, Issidae) were analysed. The propulsion for a jump was delivered\nby rapid movements of the hind legs that both move in the same plane beneath\nthe body and parallel to its longitudinal axis, as revealed in high-speed\nsequences of images captured at rates up to 7500 images s–1.\nThe first and key movement was the depression of both trochantera about their\ncoxae, powered by large depressor muscles in the thorax, accompanied by rapid\nextension of the tibiae about their femora. The initial movements of the two\ntrochantera of the hind legs were synchronised to within 0.03 ms. The hind\nlegs are only 20% longer than the front and middle legs, represent 65% of the\nbody length, and have a ratio of 1.8 relative to the cube root of the body\nmass. The two hind coxae have a different structure to those in frog- and\nleafhoppers. They are fused at the mid-line, covered ventrally by transparent\ncuticle, and each is fixed laterally to a part of the internal skeleton called\nthe pleural arch that extends to the articulation of a hind wing. A small and\npointed, ventral coxal protrusion covered in microtrichia engages with a\nraised, smooth, white patch on a dorsal femur when a hind leg is levated\n(cocked) in preparation for a jump. In the best jumps by a male\nIssus, the body was accelerated in 0.8 ms to a take-off velocity of\n5.5 m s–1, was subjected to a force of 719 g and was\ndisplaced a horizontal distance of 1.1 m. This performance required an energy\noutput of 303 μJ, a power output of 388 mW and exerted a force of 141 mN,\nor more than 700 times its body mass.

The\ndepolarization amplitude was largest when the cooling stimulus was started\nfrom the culture temperature, whilst when cooling started at a temperature\nmore than 5°C higher or lower than the culture temperature, only a small\ndepolarization was induced. Therefore, the cooling-induced response was\ndependent on the culture temperature and its sensitivity to the cooling\nstimulus was highest at the culture temperature. Membrane fluidity\nmeasurements of living cells using the fluorescent dye\n6-lauroyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (laurdan) showed that the fluidity\nmeasured at the culture temperature was almost constant irrespective of the\ntemperature at which the cells had been cultured and adapted, which is\nconsistent with homeoviscous adaptation. The constant fluidity at the culture\ntemperature quickly decreased within a few seconds of application of the\ncooling stimulus, and the decreased fluidity gradually readapted to a constant\nlevel at the decreased temperature within 1 h. When the constant fluidity at\nculture temperature was modified by the addition of procaine or benzyl\nalcohol, the cooling-induced depolarization was completely abolished. These\nresults suggest the possibility that the adaptation of fluidity to a constant\nlevel and its quick decrease below the constant level activate\ncooling-sensitive channels to elicit the transient depolarization."},{"title":"Osmoregulation and salinity tolerance in the Antarctic midge, Belgica\nantarctica: seawater exposure confers enhanced tolerance to freezing and\ndehydration","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/17/2864","abstract":"Summer storms along the Antarctic Peninsula can cause microhabitats of the\nterrestrial midge Belgica antarctica to become periodically inundated\nwith seawater from tidal spray.

The present study assessed the tolerance and physiological response\nof B. antarctica larvae to salinity exposure, and examined the effect\nof seawater acclimation on their subsequent tolerance of freezing, dehydration\nand heat shock. Midge larvae tolerated extended exposure to hyperosmotic\nseawater; nearly 50% of larvae survived a 10-day exposure to 1000 mOsm\nkg–1 seawater and ∼25% of larvae survived 6 days in 2000\nmOsm kg–1 seawater. Exposure to seawater drastically reduced\nlarval body water content and increased hemolymph osmolality. By contrast,\nimmersion in freshwater did not affect water content or hemolymph osmolality.\nHyperosmotic seawater exposure, and the accompanying osmotic dehydration,\nresulted in a significant correlation between the rate of oxygen consumption\nand larval water content and induced the de novo synthesis and\naccumulation of several organic osmolytes. A 3-day exposure of larvae to\nhyperosmotic seawater increased freezing tolerance relative to\nfreshwater-acclimated larvae. Even after rehydration, the freezing survival of\nlarvae acclimated to seawater was greater than freshwater-acclimated larvae.\nAdditionally, seawater exposure increased the subsequent tolerance of larvae\nto dehydration.

The use of surface tension for spore ejection offers a new paradigm\nto perform work at small length scales. However, this mechanism of force\ngeneration remains poorly understood. To elucidate how fungal spores make\neffective use of surface tension, we performed a detailed mechanical analysis\nof the three stages of spore ejection: the transfer of energy from the drop to\nthe spore, the work of fracture required to release the spore from its\nsupporting structure and the kinetic energy of the spore after ejection.\nHigh-speed video imaging of spore ejection in Auricularia auricula\nand Sporobolomyces yeasts revealed that drop coalescence takes place\nover a short distance (∼5 μm) and energy transfer is completed in less\nthan 4 μs. Based on these observations, we developed an explicit relation\nfor the conversion of surface energy into kinetic energy during the\ncoalescence process. The relation was validated with a simple artificial\nsystem and shown to predict the initial spore velocity accurately (predicted\nvelocity: 1.2 m s–1; observed velocity: 0.8 m\ns–1 for A. auricula). Using calibrated\nmicrocantilevers, we also demonstrate that the work required to detach the\nspore from the supporting sterigma represents only a small fraction of the\ntotal energy available for spore ejection.

By sequence comparison these four AQP\northologs resemble human AQP1 (eel AQP1), AQP3 (eel AQP3) and AQP10 (AQPe).\nThe fourth member is a duplicate form of AQP1 (AQP1dup) thought to arise from\na duplication of the teleost genome. Using heterologous expression in\nXenopus oocytes we demonstrate that all four eel orthologs transport\nwater and are mercury inhibitable. Eel AQP3 and AQPe also transport urea and\nglycerol, making them aquaglyceroporins. Eel AQP3 is dramatically inhibited by\nextracellular acidity (91% and 69% inhibition of water and glycerol transport\nrespectively at pH 6.5) consistent with channel gating by protons. Maximal\nwater flux of eel AQP3 occurred around pH 8.2 – close to the\nphysiological pH of plasma in the eel. Exposure of AQP-expressing oocytes to\nheavy metals revealed that eel AQP3 is highly sensitive to extracellular\nnickel and zinc (88.3% and 86.3% inhibition, respectively) but less sensitive\nto copper (56.4% inhibition).

In this study, the role of\nphotoreactivation in the survival of coral planulae was examined.\nPhotoreactivation is a light-stimulated response to UV-damaged DNA in which\nphotolyase proteins repair damaged DNA. Photoreactivation rates, as well as\nthe localization of photolyase, were explored in planulae under conditions\nwhere photoreactivation was or was not inhibited. The results indicate that\nphotoreactivation is the main DNA repair pathway in coral planulae, repairing\nUV-induced DNA damage swiftly (K=1.75 h–1 and a\nhalf-life of repair of 23 min), with no evidence of any light-independent DNA\nrepair mechanisms, such as nucleotide excision repair (NER), at work.\nPhotolyase mRNA was localized to both the ectoderm and endoderm of the larvae.\nThe amount of cell death in the coral planulae increased significantly when\nphotoreactivation was inhibited, by blocking photoreactivating light.

Thus,\nfollowing mating increases in JH titre increase demand for, and lowering of,\nblood sugar to develop oocytes, which can be compensated for by sugar\ningestion. Haemolymph trehalose concentration probably influences glycolysis\nin gland cells and, consequently, levels of cytosolic citrate and acetyl-CoA\nfor pheromone biosynthesis.

Based on flow visualizations obtained from applying\nparticle image velocimetry to the lobster model, we propose that the unsteady\nmetachronal kinematics of the pleopods can maximize thrust by exploiting\nforces arising from individual pleopod activity and interactions among\nadjacent pairs. The pleopods continuously entrain fluid surrounding the\nlobster and create a caudally directed fluid jet oriented parallel to the\nsubstratum.

Looping is a typical exploratory mode of sightless\nexplorers, based on returning to a recently traveled place. Wall-following is\ncommon in enclosed spaces, whereby explorers follow the perimeter of the\nenvironment. Both looping and wall-following are based on an egocentric frame\nof reference by which explorers obtain information about the shape, size and\nlandmarks in the environment.

Variable-density gases\nand high-speed video were used to determine the maximum hovering flight\ncapacity and wing kinematics of age-matched nurse bees and foragers sampled\nfrom a single-cohort colony over a period of 34 days. The transition from hive\nwork to foraging was accompanied by a 42% decrease in body mass and a\nproportional increase in flight capacity (defined as the minimum gas density\nallowing hovering flight). The lower flight capacity of hive bees was\nprimarily due to the fact that in air they were functioning at a near-maximal\nwing angular velocity due to their high body masses. Foragers were lighter and\nwhen hovering in air required a much lower wing angular velocity, which they\nwere able to increase by 32% during maximal flight performance. Flight\nperformance of hive bees was independent of age, but in foragers the maximal\nwingbeat frequency and maximal average angular velocity were lowest in\nprecocious (7–14 day old) foragers, highest in normal-aged (15–28\nday old) foragers and intermediate in foragers older than 29 days.

In view of these differences we have\ninvestigated the basis of the secretory response of the possum ileum. In the\nUssing chamber the secretory Isc is independent of\nCl– but dependent upon Na+ and serosal\nHCO3–/CO2, suggesting that\nsecretagogues stimulate electrogenic HCO3–\nsecretion. In agreement with this, serosal DIDS\n(4,4′-diisothiocyano-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; 1 mmol\nl–1) inhibited the secretory response. However, acetazolamide\n(1 mmol l–1) and serosal amiloride (1 mmol\nl–1) had little effect, indicating that\nHCO3– secretion is driven by\nHCO3– transport from the serosal solution into the\ncell, rather than hydration of CO2 by carbonic anhydrase.\nConsistent with this the pancreatic variant of the electrogenic\nNa+/HCO3– cotransporter (pNBC) is\nhighly expressed in the ileal epithelium and is located in the basolateral\nmembrane of the epithelial cells, predominantly in the mid region of the\nvilli, with lower levels of expression in the crypts and no expression in the\nvillous tips.

To gain fundamental insight into LEV stability on flapping fly\nwings we expressed the Navier–Stokes equations in a rotating frame of\nreference attached to the wing's surface. Using these equations we show that\nLEV dynamics on flapping wings are governed by three terms: angular,\ncentripetal and Coriolis acceleration. Our analysis for hovering conditions\nshows that angular acceleration is proportional to the inverse of\ndimensionless stroke amplitude, whereas Coriolis and centripetal acceleration\nare proportional to the inverse of the Rossby number. Using a dynamically\nscaled robot model of a flapping fruit fly wing to systematically vary these\ndimensionless numbers, we determined which of the three accelerations mediate\nLEV stability. Our force measurements and flow visualizations indicate that\nthe LEV is stabilized by the `quasi-steady' centripetal and Coriolis\naccelerations that are present at low Rossby number and result from the\npropeller-like sweep of the wing. In contrast, the unsteady angular\nacceleration that results from the back and forth motion of a flapping wing\ndoes not appear to play a role in the stable attachment of the LEV. Angular\nacceleration is, however, critical for LEV integrity as we found it can\nmediate LEV spiral bursting, a high Reynolds number effect. Our analysis and\nexperiments further suggest that the mechanism responsible for LEV stability\nis not dependent on Reynolds number, at least over the range most relevant for\ninsect flight (100<Re<14,000). LEVs are stable and continue to\naugment force even when they burst. These and similar findings for propellers\nand wind turbines at much higher Reynolds numbers suggest that even large\nflying animals could potentially exploit LEV-based force augmentation during\nslow hovering flight, take-offs or landing. We calculated the Rossby number\nfrom single-wing aspect ratios of over 300 insects, birds, bats, autorotating\nseeds, and pectoral fins of fish. We found that, on average, wings and fins\nhave a Rossby number close to that of flies (Ro=3). Theoretically,\nmany of these animals should therefore be able to generate a stable LEV, a\nprediction that is supported by recent findings for several insects, one bat,\none bird and one fish.

Instead, ANT is the principal\nuncoupling protein in birds. The relationship between oxidative capacity and\nuncoupling indicates that there is a continuum of phenotypes that fall between\nthe extremes of selection for increased heat production and increased aerobic\nactivity, whereas increased cellular ATP demand is a prerequisite for\nincreased oxidative capacity."},{"title":"The role of multiple pheromones in food recruitment by ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/15/2337","abstract":"In this paper we investigate the foraging activity of an invasive ant\nspecies, the big headed ant Pheidole megacephala. We establish that\nthe ants' behavior is consistent with the use of two different pheromone\nsignals, both of which recruit nestmates. Our experiments suggest that during\nexploration the ants deposit a long-lasting pheromone that elicits a weak\nrecruitment of nestmates, while when exploiting food the ants deposit a\nshorter lasting pheromone eliciting a much stronger recruitment. We further\ninvestigate experimentally the role of these pheromones under both static and\ndynamic conditions and develop a mathematical model based on the hypothesis\nthat exploration locally enhances exploitation, while exploitation locally\nsuppresses exploration. The model and the experiments indicate that\nexploratory pheromone allows the colony to more quickly mobilize foragers when\nfood is discovered. Furthermore, the combination of two pheromones allows\ncolonies to track changing foraging conditions more effectively than would a\nsingle pheromone. In addition to the already known causes for the ecological\nsuccess of invasive ant species, our study suggests that their opportunistic\nstrategy of rapid food discovery and ability to react to changes in the\nenvironment may have strongly contributed to their dominance over native\nspecies."},{"title":"Thermal activation of escape swimming in post-hatching Xenopus\nlaevis frog larvae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/15/2356","abstract":"Survival requires the selection of appropriate behavioural responses in the\nface of danger. With respect to the threat of predation, both the decision to\nescape and the underlying neuronal mechanisms have been extensively studied,\nbut processes that trigger evasion of abiotic stressors, which are potentially\nhazardous to survival, are less well understood. Here, we document the\ninterplay between rhythmic locomotory and `C-start' escape swimming in\nXenopus frog larvae when exposed to hyperthermic conditions. As\ntemperature rises, swim cycle frequency increases while swim bout duration\ndecreases, until swimming can no longer be initiated by sensory stimuli. Above\na critical higher temperature, more intense sequences of spontaneous high\namplitude C-start escape activity occur. Each C-start is followed by a few\ncycles of fast rhythmic swimming in which activity alternates between the two\nsides. The initial, high amplitude ventral root burst of an escape sequence\npropagates rostrocaudally approximately threefold faster than subsequent\ncycles. The high conduction velocity of this initial burst is consistent with\nthe activation of a Mauthner neuron, one of a pair of giant reticulospinal\nneurons in fish and amphibians. In support of the involvement of a Mauthner\nneuron, unilateral lesions of the caudal hindbrain eliminated escape activity\non the operated side, but activity remained on the un-operated side.\nBehaviourally, tadpoles responded to temperature ramps with a sequence of\nC-start responses in which the body arced through ∼130° in 22 ms,\nfollowed by high frequency swimming. These results suggest that high\ntemperature activates the Mauthner neurons to trigger C-start escape\nbehaviour."},{"title":"Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope turnover rates and diet–tissue\ndiscrimination in Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus\nlatirostris)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/15/2349","abstract":"The Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) is a\nherbivorous marine mammal that occupies freshwater, estuarine and marine\nhabitats.

Spiny lobsters that engaged\nprimarily in physical aggressive behaviors became dominant, whereas spiny\nlobsters that received these physical aggressive behaviors responded with\navoidance behaviors and became subordinates. Dominant animals frequently\nreleased urine during social interactions, more than when they were not in\ncontact with subordinates and more than when they were not paired with another\nanimal.

Seabirds are inaccessible during this season, so\nconventional metabolic studies are extremely challenging and new approaches\nare needed. This paper describes and uses a state-of-the-art mechanistic\nmodel, Niche Mapper™, to predict energy expenditure and food\nrequirements of the two main seabird species wintering in the northwest\nAtlantic. We found that energy demand increased throughout the winter phase in\nboth species. Across this period, mean estimated daily energy requirements\nwere 1306 kJ day–1 for Brünnich's guillemots (Uria\nlomvia) and 430 kJ day–1 for little auks (Alle\nalle) wintering off Greenland and Newfoundland. Mean estimated daily food\nrequirements were 547 g wet food day–1 for Brünnich's\nguillemots, and 289 g wet food day–1 for little auks. For\nboth species and both wintering sites, our model predicts a sharp increase in\nenergy expenditure between November and December, primarily driven by climatic\nfactors such as air temperature and wind speed. These findings strongly\nsuggest the existence of an energetic bottleneck for North Atlantic seabirds\ntowards the end of the year, a challenging energetic phase which might explain\nrecurrent events of winter mass-mortality, so called `seabird winter wrecks'.\nOur study therefore emphasizes the relevance of thermodynamics/biophysical\nmodelling for investigating the energy balance of wintering marine top\npredators and its interplay with survival and population dynamics in the\ncontext of global change."},{"title":"Skeletal muscle substrate utilization is altered by acute and acclimatory\ntemperature in the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeiana)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/15/2378","abstract":"We investigated the effect of acute and acclimatory temperature on the\nrelative contribution of glucose and lactate to metabolism in resting\nsartorius muscle of the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeiana).\nWe examined the fate of these metabolites in vitro by supplying\nradiolabeled [14C]glucose, [14C]lactate and\n[14C]palmitate to isolated muscle bundles from frogs (1) acutely\nexposed to incubation conditions of 5, 15 or 25°C, (2) acclimated for\n2–6 weeks to 5 or 25°C or (3) acclimated for 2–6 weeks to 5 or\n25°C and the muscles incubated at 15°C.

However, studies oriented to evaluate changes of whole\norganism structure and physiology still are scarce, which is particularly true\nfor amphibians that hibernate on land. Accordingly, in the Andean toad\n(Bufo spinulosus), we investigated the effect of short-term fasting\nand hibernation on the hydrolytic activity of digestive enzymes, histology of\nthe small intestine, gross morphology of digestive and other internal organs\nand standard metabolic rate. Based on the pattern of size variation, internal\norgans may be grouped into those that were affected by both season and feeding\ncondition (small intestine, stomach and liver), those that were only affected\nby season (fat bodies), those that were only affected by feeding condition\n(kidneys) and, finally, those that did not change between the three groups\n(large intestine, heart and lungs). Hydrolytic activity of maltase, trehalase\nand aminopeptidase-N followed the same pattern of variation\n(feeding>fasting>hibernating toads), although the change for the latter\nenzyme was less noticeable than for the disaccharidases. Enzymatic adjustments\nwere correlated with changes in small intestine histology: villus and\nenterocyte height increased from hibernating to fasting and more markedly from\nfasting to feeding toads. Metabolic rate decreased during hibernation to 7.8%\n(at 5°C) and 13.6% (at 15°C) of summer values, which is one of the\nhighest metabolic depressions reported for any ectothermic vertebrate.

The ambush\nforaging southern catfish (Silurus meridionlis) had the fewest\nmovements per minute (MPM), lowest per cent time spent moving (PTM), slowest\ncritical swimming speed (Ucrit), lowest maintenance\nmetabolism\n(V̇O2rest) and\nlowest maximum locomotory metabolism\n(V̇O2max).\nHowever, the southern catfish had the highest feeding level and maximum\nfeeding metabolism\n(V̇O2peak) and the\ngreatest decrease in Ucrit after consumption of a large\nmeal. Thus, this fish is highly adapted to its ambush behavioural strategy and\nsedentary life style. In the herbivorous grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon\nidellus), a low digestive capacity led to little change in postprandial\nlocomotory performance, which benefits its frequent grazing behaviour. In this\nspecies, the greater amount of energy spent on routine activity and avoiding\npredators versus Ucrit might be related to its herbivorous\nlife style and high predation risk. The active foraging crucian carp\n(Carassius auratus) adopts a unique high energy cost strategy that\nallows for high capacity in both routine activity and digestion, and the great\nflexibility of its cardio-respiratory capacity (increased\nV̇O2max after\nfeeding) guarantees a small decrease in Ucrit even after\nmaximum feeding.

During supercontraction, unrestrained\ndragline silk contracts up to 50% of its original length and restrained fibers\ngenerate substantial stress. Here we characterize the response of dragline\nsilk to changes in humidity before, during and after supercontraction. Our\nfindings demonstrate that dragline silk exhibits two qualitatively different\nresponses to humidity. First, silk undergoes a previously unknown cyclic\nrelaxation–contraction response to wetting and drying. The direction and\nmagnitude of this cyclic response is identical both before and after\nsupercontraction. By contrast, supercontraction is a `permanent' tensioning of\nrestrained silk in response to high humidity. Here, water induces stress,\nrather than relaxation and the uptake of water molecules results in a\npermanent change in molecular composition of the silk, as demonstrated by\nthermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Even after drying, silk mass increased by∼\n1% after supercontraction. By contrast, the cyclic response to humidity\ninvolves a reversible uptake of water.

In particular, the fine-tuning effect of temperature on gonadal\ngrowth is not well known. One way temperature may affect timing is\nvia its strong effect on energy expenditure as gonadal growth is an\nenergy-demanding process. To study the interaction of photoperiod and\ntemperature on gonadal development, we first exposed 35 individually housed\nmale great tits (Parus major) to mid-long days (after 6 weeks of 8 h\nL:16 h D at 15°C, photoperiod was set to 13 h L:11 h D at 15°C). Two\nweeks later, for half of the males the temperature was set to 8°C, and for\nthe other half to 22°C. Unilateral laparotomies were performed at weeks 5\n(i.e one week before the birds were transferred to mid-long days), 8 and 11 to\nmeasure testis size. Two measures of basal metabolic rate (BMR) were performed\nat the end of the experiment (weeks 11 and 12). Testis size increased\nsignificantly during the course of the experiment, but independently of the\ntemperature treatment. BMR was significantly higher in birds exposed to the\ncold treatment. These results show that temperature-related elevation of BMR\ndid not impair the long-day-induced testis growth in great tits. As a\nconsequence, temperature may not be a crucial cue and/or constraint factor in\nthe fine-tuning of the gonadal recrudescence in male great tits, and testis\ngrowth is not a high energy-demanding seasonal process."},{"title":"Peripheral and behavioral plasticity of pheromone response and its hormonal control in a long-lived moth","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/13/2000","abstract":"Reproductive success in many animals depends on the efficient production of\nand response to sexual signals.

Male sex pheromone responsiveness is plastic and\ncorresponds with female receptivity. Pheromone response plasticity has not\nbeen studied in a moth with an extended period of reproductive inactivity. In\nthis study, we ask whether male antennal response and flight behavior are\nplastic during different stages of reproductive inactivity and whether these\nresponses are regulated by juvenile hormone. Antennal response to the\npheromone blend is significantly reduced in reproductively inactive males\ntested in the summer and autumn as compared with reproductively active males\ntested in the spring. Reproductively inactive autumn but not summer males show\nlower antennal responses to individual pheromone components compared with\nspring males. Treatment with methoprene enhances antennal response of autumn\nbut not summer males to high doses of the pheromone blend. Behavioral response\nis induced by methoprene treatment in males treated in the autumn but not in\nthe summer. Plasticity of pheromone response in C. fraxinella is\nregulated, at least in part, by the peripheral nervous system.

Surprisingly, however, there is not\nan acute metabolic depression during diapause entry at the point when\ndevelopmental ceases (4–5 days post-oviposition), as measured by\nblockage of morphological change and DNA proliferation. The results indicate a\ndecoupling of developmental arrest from metabolism. Both non-diapause and\ndiapause embryos have unusually high [AMP]:[ATP] ratios and low [ATP]:[ADP]\nratios during early embryogenesis, which suggests embryos may have experienced\nhypoxia as a result of an insect chorion that limits water loss but may\nrestrict oxygen diffusion. The similar adenylate profiles for these two\ndevelopmental states indicate the atypical energy status is not a specific\nfeature of diapause.

As steep\nterrain-adapted animals, changes in muscle work output are expected to be\nparticularly important for goats. In vivo muscle–tendon forces,\nfascicle length changes and muscle activation were recorded via\ntendon force buckles, sonomicrometry and electromyography to evaluate the work\nperformance and elastic energy recovery of the three distal MTUs. These\nrecordings confirmed that fascicle strain and force within goat distal hind\nlimb muscles are adjusted in response to changes in mechanical work demand\nassociated with locomotor grade. In general, muscle work was modulated most\nconsistently by changes in fascicle strain, with increased net shortening\n(P<0.001) observed as goats switched from decline to level to\nincline locomotion. Peak muscle stresses increased as goats increased speed\nfrom a walk to a trot within each grade condition (P<0.05), and\nalso increased significantly with grade (P<0.05 to\nP<0.01).

These\nresults demonstrate, for the first time in a quadruped, similar findings to\nthose observed in ankle extensor muscles in humans, wallabies, turkeys and\nguinea fowl, suggesting that distal muscle–tendon architecture more\ngenerally favors a design for economic force production and tendon elastic\nenergy recovery, with the majority of limb work during incline or decline\nrunning performed by larger proximal muscles."},{"title":"Rhabdom constriction enhances filtering by the red screening pigment in\nthe eye of the Eastern Pale Clouded yellow butterfly, Colias erate\n(Pieridae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/13/2057","abstract":"Here we report the remarkable anatomy of the eye of the Eastern Pale\nClouded yellow butterfly, Colias erate.

At the kidney, glomerular filtration\nrate, urine flow rate, and tubular Na+ reabsorption rate fell in\nparallel by 70% during hypoxia, facilitating additional reductions in costs\nand in urinary Na+, K+ and ammonia excretion rates.\nScanning electron microscopy of the gill epithelium revealed no remodelling at\na macro-level, but pronounced changes in surface morphology. Under normoxia,\nmitochondria-rich cells were exposed only through small apical crypts, and\nthese decreased in number by 47% and in individual area by 65% during 3 h\nhypoxia. We suggest that a rapid closure of transcellular channels, perhaps\neffected by pavement cell coverage of the crypts, allows conservation of ions\nand reduction of ionoregulatory costs without compromise of O2\nexchange capacity during acute hypoxia, a response very different from the\ntraditional osmorespiratory compromise."},{"title":"The independent effect of added mass on the stability of the sagittal plane leg kinematics during steady-state human walking","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/12/1965","abstract":"This study investigated the independent effect of added mass on the\nstability of the leg kinematics during human walking.

We hypothesized that walking with added mass would reduce the\nstability of the leg kinematics. Lower extremity sagittal plane joint\nkinematics were recorded for 23 subjects as they walked on a treadmill at\ntheir preferred speed with and without added mass. The total mass of each\nsubject was manipulated with combinations of simulated reduced gravity and\nadded load. The stability of the leg kinematics was evaluated by computing the\neigenvalues of the Poincaré map (i.e. Floquet analysis) that defined\nthe position and velocity of the right hip, knee and ankle at heel-contact and\nmid-swing. Significant differences in stability were found between the various\nadded mass conditions (P=0.040) and instant in the gait cycle\n(P=0.001).

Seven dogs were\nvideotaped at 250 Hz as they performed `maximum effort' accelerations,\nstarting in a standing position on a force plate and one and two strides\nbefore it. These dogs began accelerations by rapidly flexing their ankles and\nknees as they dropped into a crouch. The crouched posture was maintained in\nthe first accelerating stride such that the ankle and knee were significantly\nmore flexed than during steady high-speed galloping. The hindlimb was also\nsignificantly more retracted over the first stance period than during\nhigh-speed galloping. Ground forces differed from steady-state locomotion in\nthat rapidly accelerating dogs supported only 43% of their body weight with\nthe forelimbs, compared with 56–64% in steady-state locomotion. The\nhindlimbs applied greater peak accelerating forces than the forelimbs, but the\nforelimbs contributed significantly to the dogs' acceleration by producing 43%\nof the total propulsive impulse. Kinematically, rapid acceleration differs\nfrom steady-state galloping in that the limbs are more flexed and more\nretracted, while the back undergoes greater pitching movement.

Studies of mechanically generated starting jets have revealed\na limiting principle for vortex ring formation characterized in terms of a\n`formation number' (F), which delineates the transition between the\nformation of isolated vortex rings and vortex rings that have `pinched off'\nfrom the generating jet. Near F, there exists an optimum in\npulse-averaged thrust with (potentially) low energetic cost, raising the\nquestion: do squids produce vortex rings and if so, do they fall near\nF, where propulsive benefits presumably occur? To better understand\nvortex ring dynamics and propulsive jet efficiency throughout ontogeny, brief\nsquid Lolliguncula brevis ranging from 3.3 to 9.1 cm dorsal mantle\nlength (DML) and swimming at speeds of 2.43–22.2\ncms–1 (0.54–3.50 DMLs–1) were\nstudied using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). A range of jet\nstructures were observed but most structures could be classified as variations\nof two principal jet modes: (1) jet mode I, where the ejected fluid rolled up\ninto an isolated vortex ring; and (2) jet mode II, where the ejected fluid\ndeveloped into a leading vortex ring that separated or `pinched off' from a\nlong trailing jet. The ratio of jet length [based on the vorticity extent\n(Lω)] to jet diameter [based on peak vorticity\nlocations (Dω)] was <3.0 for jet mode I and>\n3.0 for jet mode II, placing the transition between modes in rough\nagreement with F determined in mechanical jet studies. Jet mode II\nproduced greater time-averaged thrust and lift forces and was the jet mode\nmost heavily used whereas jet mode I had higher propulsive efficiency, lower\nslip, shorter jet periods and a higher frequency of fin activity associated\nwith it. No relationship between\nLω/Dω and speed was\ndetected and there was no apparent speed preference for the jet modes within\nthe speed range considered in this study; however, propulsive efficiency did\nincrease with speed partly because of a reduction in slip and jet angle with\nspeed. Trends in higher slip, lower propulsive efficiency and higher relative\nlift production were observed for squid <5.0 cm DML compared with\nsquid ≥5.0 cm DML. While these trends were observed when jet mode\nI and II were equally represented among the size classes, there was also\ngreater relative dependence on jet mode I than jet mode II for squid <5.0\ncm DML when all of the available jet sequences were examined.\nCollectively, these results indicate that ∼5.0 cm DML is an\nimportant ontogenetic transition for the hydrodynamics of pulsed jetting in\nsquids. The significance of our findings is that from early juvenile through\nto adult life stages, L. brevis is capable of producing a diversity\nof vortex ring-based jet structures, ranging from efficient short pulses to\nhigh-force longer duration pulses. Given that some of these structures had\nLω/Dωs near F,\nand F represented the delineation between the two primary jet modes\nobserved, fluid dynamics probably played an integral role in the evolution of\nsquid locomotive systems. When this flexibility in jet dynamics is coupled\nwith the highly versatile fins, which are capable of producing multiple\nhydrodynamic modes as well, it is clear that squid have a locomotive\nrepertoire far more complex than originally thought."},{"title":"Differential conditioning and long-term olfactory memory in individual\nCamponotus fellah ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/12/1904","abstract":"Individual Camponotus fellah ants perceive and learn odours in a\nY-maze in which one odour is paired with sugar (CS+) while a different odour\n(CS–) is paired with quinine (differential conditioning).

We investigated three species of sea\nkraits (Elapidae: Laticaudinae) that are common to Orchid Island (Lanyu),\nTaiwan.

Previously reported losses of water from snakes\nkept in seawater exhibit a reversed trend, with lower rates of loss in the\nmore aquatic species. These data suggest selection for adaptive traits with\nrespect to increasing exposure to the marine environment. Thus, a\ncountergradient of traits is reflected in decreased TEWL in aerial\nenvironments and decreased net water efflux in marine environments, acting\nsimultaneously in the three species. The pattern for TEWL correlates with\nultrastructural evidence for increased lipogenesis in the stratum corneum of\nthe more terrestrial species. The skin surfaces of all three species are\nhydrophobic.

By calculating colour contrasts\nof both prey-remain and egg-sac decorations against spiders viewed by bird\n(blue tits) and hymenopteran (e.g. wasps) predators as well as hymenopteran\n(bees) prey, we showed that C. mulmeinensis spiders on webs with\negg-sac decorations were invisible to both hymenopteran prey and predators and\nbird predators over short and long distances.

Under conditions of crowding or confinement,\nfasted toadfish excrete the majority of their nitrogen waste in large pulses\nof urea (>90% of total nitrogen) lasting up to 3 h. An earlier study\ndemonstrated that cortisol has an inhibitory influence on urea pulse size. The\npresent study tested the hypothesis that cortisol mediates changes in urea\npulse size in ureotelic toadfish through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and\nnot the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). In vivo pharmacological\ninvestigations were used to manipulate the corticosteroid system in crowded\ntoadfish, including experimentally lowering plasma cortisol levels by the\ninjection of metyrapone, blocking cortisol receptors through exposure to\neither RU-486 (GR antagonist) and spironolactone (MR antagonist), or through\nexogenous infusion of the tetrapod mineralocorticoid aldosterone (tetrapod MR\nagonist). The data demonstrate that lowering the activity of cortisol, either\nby inhibiting its synthesis or by blocking its receptor, resulted in a two- to\nthreefold increase in pulse size with no accompanying change in pulse\nfrequency. Treatment with spironolactone elicited a minor (∼1.5-fold)\nreduction in pulse size, as did aldosterone treatment, suggesting that the\nanti-mineralocorticoid spironolactone has an agonistic effect in a piscine\nsystem. In summary, the evidence suggests that urea transport mechanisms in\npulsing toadfish are upregulated in response to low cortisol, mediated\nprimarily by GRs, and to a lesser extent MRs."},{"title":"Division of labour and sex differences between fibrillar, tarsal adhesive pads in beetles: effective elastic modulus and attachment performance","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/12/1876","abstract":"Many beetles employ arrays of adhesive setae to control attachment during\nlocomotion.

We\nvertically compressed individual adhesive pads to determine their effective\nelastic modulus. Distal adhesive arrays were significantly softer than middle\nand proximal ones. Variation in stiffness was mainly due to different seta\ndiameters, but calculated elastic moduli of seta cuticle were relatively\nconstant at 5–16 GPa. Consistent with their greater compliance, distal\npads generated higher adhesion and friction on rough substrates. However, the\ngreater stiffness of proximal pads conveys a superior ability to push.\nProximal pads of males were less direction dependent than distal pads and\ngenerated larger pushing forces in the distal and lateral directions. In\nfemales, proximal pads also produced higher friction forces than distal pads,\nbut only in the lateral direction. Video recordings of vertically climbing\nbeetles confirmed that each pad was used differently. When legs above the body\ncentre of gravity were pulling, beetles mainly engaged the distal pads,\nwhereas legs below the centre of gravity mainly pushed with the proximal pads.\nAttachment performance was additionally compared between sexes on different\nsubstrates.

In this\nstudy, we show that venom removal leads to the activation of transcription\nfactors NFκB and AP-1 in the venom gland. In dispersed secretory cells,\nnoradrenaline activated both NFκB and AP-1. Activation of NFκB and\nAP-1 depended on phospholipase C and protein kinase A.

We investigated the temporal\ndynamics of PHA-induced immune response and associated changes in blood\ncarotenoids, body mass and a carotenoid-based coloured signal. We found\nvariation in individual response patterns to PHA after peak swelling was\nreached, with birds showing either a rapid or a slow subsequent decrease in\nswelling, suggesting variation in the duration of the immune response and/or\ninflammation. Body mass did not affect immune response. Plasma carotenoids\nfollowed a transient decrease closely matching the dynamics of the swelling.\nThe peak of the immune response was negatively related to initial plasma\ncarotenoid levels and positively correlated to the relative decrease in plasma\ncarotenoids. Individual variation in duration of the swelling could be partly\nexplained by plasma carotenoids; high initial carotenoid levels were\nassociated with a slower decrease of the swelling. These contradictory effects\nof carotenoids suggest a complex role in the immune response.

To understand the neural basis of this\nbehavioural plasticity, we performed a detailed characterization of the\nqualitative, quantitative and temporal aspects of pheromone coding in the\nprimary centre of integration of pheromonal information, the macroglomerular\ncomplex (MGC) of the antennal lobe.

Although\nthey showed different preferences, 80% of the neurons responded at least to\nthe main pheromone component (Z-7-dodecenyl acetate). Six stained\nneurons responding to this component had their dendrites in the largest MGC\nglomerulus. Changes in the stimulus intensity and duration affected the\nexcitatory phase but not the inhibitory phase properties. The stimulus\nintensity was shown to be encoded in the firing frequency, the number of\nspikes and the latency of the excitatory phase, whereas the stimulus duration\nonly changed its duration.

Here, we present a simple mechanical model of the\nsyrinx that facilitates detailed study of vibrations and sound production. Our\nmodel resembles the `starling resistor', a collapsible tube model, and\nconsists of a tube with a single membrane in its casing, suspended in an\nexternal pressure chamber and driven by various pressure patterns. With this\ndesign, we can separately control `bronchial' pressure and tension in the\noscillating membrane and generate a wide variety of `syllables' with simple\nsweeps of the control parameters. We show that the membrane exhibits high\nfrequency, self-sustained oscillations in the audio range (>600 Hz\nfundamental frequency) using laser Doppler vibrometry, and systematically\nexplore the conditions for sound production of the model in its control space.\nThe fundamental frequency of the sound increases with tension in three\nmembranes with different stiffness and mass. The lower-bound fundamental\nfrequency increases with membrane mass. The membrane vibrations are strongly\ncoupled to the resonance properties of the distal tube, most likely because of\nits reflective properties to sound waves.

To control flight speed, the visual system of the fruit fly\nextracts linear pattern velocity robustly over a broad range of\nspatio–temporal frequencies. The speed signal is used for a proportional\ncontrol of flight speed within locomotor limits. The extraction of pattern\nvelocity over a broad spatio–temporal frequency range may require more\nsophisticated motion processing mechanisms than those identified in flies so\nfar. In Drosophila, the neuromotor pathways underlying flight speed\ncontrol may be suitably explored by applying advanced genetic techniques, for\nwhich our data can serve as a baseline. Finally, the high-level control\nprinciples identified in the fly can be meaningfully transferred into a\nrobotic context, such as for the robust and efficient control of autonomous\nflying micro air vehicles."},{"title":"Nervous and humoral control of cardiac performance in the winter flounder\n(Pleuronectes americanus)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/7/934","abstract":"Previous studies have suggested that flatfish lack adrenergic cardiac\ninnervation and have a limited humoral adrenergic stress response.

Here I examine the entire process of fatigue, from crack initiation\nto eventual specimen fracture, in the common red alga Mazzaella.\nPropensity for fatigue failure in laboratory tests varied with life history\nphase and species: at a given repeated loading stress, male gametophytes\nendured more loading cycles before breakage than tetrasporophytes, which in\nturn lasted longer than female gametophytes; likewise, M. splendens\nwithstood more loading cycles at a given repeated loading stress than M.\nflaccida. Fatigue failure begins with formation of cracks, the timing and\nlocation of which were assessed. Cracks formed, on average, after\napproximately 80–90% of cycles required for failure had passed, although\ncrack timing varied with life history phase. Also, crack formation frequently\noccurred in association with endophytes and female gametophyte reproductive\nstructures, suggesting a cost of endophyte infection and a tradeoff between\nreproduction and mechanical survival.

In heart ventricle preparations from this\nspecies, the ratio of twitch force to O2 consumption increased by\napproximately 15% during full oxygenation and by approximately 60% during\nhypoxia in the presence of added l-arginine [the substrate for\nnitric oxide synthase (NOS)]. This effect was primarily due to a decrease in\nO2 consumption and may represent an increase in the twitch force\nobtained per ATP and/or in the ATP obtained per O2. Lactate\nproduction during hypoxia did not differ between preparations treated with\neither l-arginine or asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an\ninhibitor of NOS, suggesting that NO does not elicit a compensatory increase\nin anaerobic metabolism. ADMA did not reverse the effects of\nl-arginine on O2 consumption significantly, although\npre-treatment with ADMA abolished the effect of l-arginine,\nconsistent with the competitive binding of l-arginine and ADMA to\nNOS. Histochemical studies using the fluorescent probe 4,5-diaminofluorescein\ndiacetate (DAF-2 DA) revealed NO production in the presence of added\nl-arginine.

To\nland, a bat must perform an acrobatic flip that brings the claws of the toes\nin contact with the ceiling and do so gently enough as to avoid injury to its\nslender hindlimbs. In the present study, we sought to determine how bats land,\nto seek a link between landing kinematics and ceiling impact forces, and to\ndetermine whether landing strategies vary among bat species. To do this, we\nmeasured the kinematics and kinetics of landing behaviour in three species of\nbats as they landed on a force-measuring platform (Cynopterus\nbrachyotis, N=3; Carollia perspicillata, N=5;\nGlossophaga soricina, N=5). Kinematics were similar for all\nbats within a species but differed among species. C. brachyotis\nperformed four-point landings, during which body pitch increased until the\nventral surface of the body faced the ceiling and the thumbs and hindlimbs\nsimultaneously grasped the surface. Bats of the other two species performed\ntwo-point landings, whereby only the hindlimbs made contact with the ceiling.\nDuring these two-point landings, the hindlimbs were drawn up the side of the\nbody to come in contact with the ceiling, causing simultaneous changes in body\npitch, roll and yaw over the course of the landing sequence. Right-handed and\nleft-handed forms of the two-point landing were observed, with individuals\noften switching back and forth between them among landing events. The\nfour-point landing of C. brachyotis resulted in larger peak forces\n(3.7±2.4 body weights; median ± interquartile range) than the\ntwo-point landings of C. perspicillata (0.8±0.6 body weights)\nor G. soricina (0.8±0.2 body weights). Our results demonstrate\nthat the kinematics and kinetics of landing vary among bat species and that\nthere is a correlation between the way a bat moves its body when it lands and\nthe magnitude of peak impact force it experiences during that landing. We\npostulate that these interspecific differences in impact force could result\nbecause of stronger selective pressure for gentle landing in cave-roosting\n(C. perspicillata, G. soricina) versus foliage-roosting\n(C. brachyotis) species."},{"title":"Acoustic scanning of natural scenes by echolocation in the big brown bat,\nEptesicus fuscus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/7/1011","abstract":"Echolocation allows bats to orient and localize prey in complete darkness.\nThe sonar beam of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, is directional\nbut broad enough to provide audible echo information from within a 60–90\ndeg. cone.

When the\nanterior base of the medulla in the optic lobe, where PDF-immunoreactive\nsomata (l-LNv and s-LNv) are located, was bilaterally\nablated, 55% of flies showed arrhythmic or obscure activity patterns under\nconstant darkness. Percentages of flies exhibiting a rhythmic activity pattern\ndecreased along with the number of small PDF-immunoreactive somata (i.e.\ns-Lnv). When regions containing small PDF somata (s-LNv)\nwere bilaterally ablated, flies did not discriminate photoperiod, and diapause\nincidences were 48% under long-day and 55% under short-day conditions. The\nresults suggest that circadian clock neurons, s-LNvs, driving\nbehavioural rhythms might also be involved in photoperiodism, and that\ncircadian behavioural rhythms and photoperiodism share neural elements in\ntheir underlying mechanisms."},{"title":"Urea transporter and glutamine synthetase regulation and localization in gulf toadfish gill","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/5/704","abstract":"The goal of the present study was to investigate the role of circulating\ncortisol and urea in the transcriptional regulation of branchial glutamine\nsynthetase (GS), which incorporates NH3 into glutamate to form\nglutamine, and the toadfish urea transporter, tUT, which is involved in urea\nexcretion across the gill of the gulf toadfish. GS (of which there are two\nisoforms, LGS and GGS) and tUT mRNA expression and activity were measured in\ntoadfish exposed to treatments that would induce variable stress responses. In\naddition, the role of circulating urea in tUT regulation was investigated by\ninfusing toadfish with urea alone or in combination with intraperitoneal\ninjection of RU486, a corticosteroid type II receptor antagonist. There was a\n4.8-fold upregulation in the mRNA expression of the gill-specific GS isoform\n(GGS) in response to cortisol infusion and a similar upregulation in the more\nubiquitous isoform (LGS). Furthermore, there was a significant 1.9-fold and\n3.3-fold upregulation in the mRNA expression of the toadfish urea transporter,\ntUT, in response to stress through crowding or exogenous cortisol loading\nthrough infusion, respectively. In addition, tUT was found to have a\nurea-sensitive component to transcriptional regulation that was independent of\ncirculating cortisol concentrations. However, the changes measured in mRNA\nexpression of GGS, LGS and tUT did not correspond with changes in protein\nactivity. To determine the cell type(s) involved in glutamine production and\nurea excretion, we attempted to localize GGS, LGS and tUT using in\nsitu hybridization. This study is the first to show that GGS and tUT\nexpression appear to occur in gill mitochondria-rich cells of toadfish,\nsuggesting that these cells play a combined glutamine production and urea\nexcretion role, which may have implications for predator avoidance."},{"title":"Walking, running and the evolution of short toes in humans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/5/713","abstract":"The phalangeal portion of the forefoot is extremely short relative to body\nmass in humans.

Here, we propose a\nbiomechanical model of toe function in bipedal locomotion that suggests that\nshorter pedal phalanges improve locomotor performance by decreasing digital\nflexor force production and mechanical work, which might ultimately reduce the\nmetabolic cost of flexor force production during bipedal locomotion. We tested\nthis model using kinematic, force and plantar pressure data collected from a\nhuman sample representing normal variation in toe length (N=25). The\neffect of toe length on peak digital flexor forces, impulses and work outputs\nwas evaluated during barefoot walking and running using partial correlations\nand multiple regression analysis, controlling for the effects of body mass,\nwhole-foot and phalangeal contact times and toe-out angle. Our results suggest\nthat there is no significant increase in digital flexor output associated with\nlonger toes in walking. In running, however, multiple regression analyses\nbased on the sample suggest that increasing average relative toe length by as\nlittle as 20% doubles peak digital flexor impulses and mechanical work,\nprobably also increasing the metabolic cost of generating these forces. The\nincreased mechanical cost associated with long toes in running suggests that\nmodern human forefoot proportions might have been selected for in the context\nof the evolution of endurance running."},{"title":"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the rock crab, Cancer\nirroratus: an early indicator of temperature stress","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/5/722","abstract":"Exposure of marine invertebrates to high temperatures leads to a switch\nfrom aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, a drop in the cellular ATP concentration\n([ATP]), and subsequent death.

We hypothesized that temperature\nstress in marine invertebrates activates AMPK to provide adequate\nconcentrations of ATP at increased but sublethal temperatures and that AMPK\nconsequently can serve as a stress indicator (similar to heat shock proteins,\nHSPs). We tested these hypotheses through two experiments with the rock crab,\nCancer irroratus. First, crabs were exposed to a progressive\ntemperature increase (6°C h–1) from 12 to 30°C. AMPK\nactivity, total AMPK protein and HSP70 levels, reaction time, heart rate and\nlactate accumulation were measured in hearts at 2°C increments. AMPK\nactivity remained constant between 12 and 18°C, but increased up to\n9.1(±1.5)-fold between 18 and 30°C. The crabs' reaction time also\ndecreased above 18°C. By contrast, HSP70 (total and inducible) and total\nAMPK protein expression levels did not vary significantly over this\ntemperature range. Second, crabs were exposed for up to 6 h to the sublethal\ntemperature of 26°C. This prolonged exposure led to a constant elevation\nof AMPK activity and levels of HSP70 mRNA. AMPK mRNA continuously increased,\nindicating an additional response in gene expression. We conclude that AMPK is\nan earlier indicator of temperature stress in rock crabs than HSP70,\nespecially during the initial response to high temperatures. We discuss the\ntemperature-dependent increase in AMPK activity in the context of Shelford's\nlaw of tolerance. Specifically, we describe AMPK activity as a cellular marker\nthat indicates a thermal threshold, called the pejus temperature,\nTp. At Tp the animals leave their\noptimum range and enter a temperature range with a limited aerobic scope for\nexercise. This Tp is reached periodically during annual\ntemperature fluctuations and has higher biological significance than earlier\ndescribed critical temperatures, at which the animals switch to anaerobic\nmetabolism and HSP expression is induced."},{"title":"Flight variability in the woodwasp Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera:\nSiricidae): an analysis of flight data using wavelets","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/5/731","abstract":"We describe flight variability in the woodwasp Sirex noctilio\nFabricius, 1793 (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) by studying tethered females in a\nflight mill device and analyzing output data by a time series methodology.\nTwenty-eight wasps were flown during 24 h-long periods, under controlled\ntemperature and lighting conditions. The maximum distance recorded was 49 km,\nand mean velocity was 0.37 m s–1. All wasps lost weight\nduring flight (mean weight loss of 10.0% of initial body mass). By using a\nwavelets analysis on the flight mill time series output, we identified three\ndistinct flight patterns: regular (long acceleration–deceleration\nspells), periodic (alternation of acceleration–deceleration spells\nwithout resting) and pulsating (resting spells interrupted by bursts of flight\nactivity). The first two flight patterns are indistinguishable using\ntraditional flight mill data analysis. Flight patterns for each individual\nwere significantly dependent on wasp body mass, suggesting a relationship with\nthe resources used in flight and their availability. Large females flew\nsequentially through a regular-periodic-pulsating sequence but medium sized\nwasps flew mostly with periodic and pulsating patterns.

A muscle-actuated forward\ndynamics walking simulation was generated to quantify each of the mechanical\nwork measures. Total joint work (i.e. the time integral of absolute joint\npower over a full gait cycle) was found to underestimate total musculotendon\nwork due to agonist–antagonist co-contractions, despite the effect of\nbiarticular muscle work and passive joint work, which acted to decrease the\nunderestimation. We did find that when the net passive joint work over the\ngait cycle is negligible, net joint work (i.e. the time integral of net joint\npower) was comparable to the net musculotendon work (and net muscle fiber work\nbecause net tendon work is zero over a complete gait cycle). Thus, during\nwalking conditions when passive joint work is negligible, net joint work may\nbe used as an estimate of net muscle work. Neither total external nor total\ninternal work (nor their sum) provided a reasonable estimate of total\nmusculotendon work.

Although many previous studies have\ninvestigated the dynamics of such dives and their effect on insect survival\nrate, there has been little work on how bats may adapt to such an insect\ndefense employed in the middle of pursuit. In this study we investigated how\nbig brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) adjust their pursuit strategy when\nflying praying mantises (Parasphendale agrionina) execute evasive,\nultrasound-triggered dives. Although the mantis dive occasionally forced the\nbat to completely abort its chase (25% trials), in a number of cases (75%\ntrials) the bat followed the mantis into the dive. In such cases the bat kept\nits sonar beam locked onto the target and maneuvered to maintain the same time\nefficient strategy it adopted during level flight pursuit, though it was\nultimately defeated by the dive. This study suggests that although the mantis\ndive can be effective in evading the bat, it does not always deter the bat\nfrom continuing pursuit and, given enough altitude, the bat can potentially\ncapture diving prey using the same flight strategy it employs to intercept\nprey in level flight."},{"title":"Using omeprazole to link the components of the post-prandial alkaline\ntide in the spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/5/684","abstract":"After a meal, dogfish exhibit a metabolic alkalosis in the bloodstream and\na marked excretion of basic equivalents across the gills to the external\nseawater.

We used phonotaxis experiments on a walking\ncompensator to study call recognition in the katydid Neoconocephalus\naffinis, a species with a double-pulsed call and an atypically slow pulse\nrate for the genus. Call recognition in this species is unusual because\nfemales require the presence of two alternating pulse amplitudes in the\nsignal. A Fourier analysis of the stimulus-envelopes revealed that females\nrespond only when both the first and second harmonics of the AM spectrum are\nof similar amplitude. The second harmonic is generated by the amplitude\ndifference between the two pulses making up a pulse-pair. Females respond to\ndouble pulses that have been merged into a single pulse only if this amplitude\nmodulation is preserved. Further experiments suggest that females use a\nresonance mechanism to recognize the pulse rate of the call, supporting a\nneural model of rate recognition in which periodic oscillations in membrane\npotential are used to filter the pulse rate of the signal. Our results\nillustrate how a reduction in pulse rate extends the opportunities for females\nto evaluate fine-scale temporal properties of calls, and provide further\nevidence for the importance of oscillatory membrane properties in temporal\nprocessing.

Importantly, these results clearly establish the aversive\nnature of SER conditioning in honeybees."},{"title":"Frequency information in the vibration-cued escape hatching of red-eyed treefrogs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/4/566","abstract":"Incidental acoustic and vibrational cues generated by predators are a\npotential source of information for prey assessing risk. Substrate vibrations\nshould be excited by most predators, and frequency, amplitude or temporal\nproperties could allow prey to distinguish predator from benign-source\nvibrations. Red-eyed treefrog embryos detect egg predators using vibrations\nexcited during attacks, hatching rapidly and prematurely to escape. We\nrecorded vibrations in egg clutches during attacks by five species of\npredators and three common types of benign physical disturbance. We analyzed\ntheir frequency distributions to assess if and how frequency properties could\nbe used to discriminate between vibration sources and used vibration playbacks\nto examine the effects of frequency properties on the escape hatching\nresponse. Vibrations produced by predators and benign disturbances generally\nhave broad and overlapping frequency distributions, and all frequencies\nexcited by attacks are also excited by benign disturbances. Decision rules\nbased on the frequency distribution of vibrations alone would therefore result\nin either high levels of hatching in response to benign vibrations (false\nalarms) or common failures to hatch in response to predators (missed cues).\nNevertheless, embryos hatch in response to predator and not benign\ndisturbances in nature, and our playback results show that vibration frequency\ninformation is an important component of their hatching decision. Embryos\ncombine frequency with temporal information to refine their hatching response.\nMoreover, comparing frequency spectra of predator and benign vibrations\nsuggests that the presence of energy in frequencies outside the range\ncharacteristic of attacks might serve as an indicator of benign\ndisturbance."},{"title":"Exploring the mechanical basis for acceleration: pelvic limb locomotor\nfunction during accelerations in racing greyhounds (Canis\nfamiliaris)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/4/550","abstract":"Animals in their natural environments are confronted with a regular need to\nperform rapid accelerations (for example when escaping from predators or\nchasing prey).

Greatest\nincreases in joint work and power with acceleration appeared at the hip and\nhock joints, particularly in the lead limb. Largest increases in absolute\npositive joint work occurred at the hip, consistent with the hypothesis that\nquadrupeds power locomotion by torque about the hip. In addition, hindlimb EMA\ndecreased substantially with increased acceleration – a potential\nstrategy to increase stance time and thus ground impulses for a given peak\nforce.

This study attempts to reveal the priority rules governing the\norganization of traffic on these trails. Ants were forced to move on a narrow\ntrail, allowing the passage of only two individuals at a time. In this\ncondition, a desynchronization of inbound and outbound traffic was observed,\ninvolving the formation of alternating clusters of inbound and outbound ants.\nMost clusters of inbound ants were headed by laden ants followed by unladen\nants. This occurred because inbound unladen ants did not attempt to overtake\nthe laden ants in front of them. As unladen ants move on average faster than\nladen ants, these ants were thus forced to decrease their speed. By contrast,\nthis decrease was counterbalanced by the fact that, by staying in a cluster\ninstead of moving in isolation, inbound unladen ants limit the number of\nhead-on encounters with outbound ants. Our analysis shows that the delay\ninduced by these head-on encounters would actually be twice as high as the\ndelay induced by the forced decrease in speed incurred by ants staying in a\ncluster. The cluster organization also promotes information transfer about the\nlevel of food availability by increasing the number of contacts between\noutbound and inbound laden ants, which could possibly stimulate these former\nto cut and retrieve leaf fragments when reaching the end of the trail."},{"title":"The specific binding sites of eyestalk- and pericardial organ-crustacean\nhyperglycaemic hormones (CHHs) in multiple tissues of the blue crab,\nCallinectes sapidus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/4/542","abstract":"Crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone from the pericardial organ (PO-CHH) is a\nCHH-related neuropeptide but its function and target tissues are not known in\ncrustaceans.

Forager honey bees perform symbolic dances to\nadvertise the location and value of floral resources to their nest mates.\nTreatment with a low dose of cocaine increased the likelihood and rate of bees\ndancing after foraging but did not otherwise increase locomotor activity.

H89 reverses the stimulatory effect of AK-III on\ntransepithelial fluid secretion in isolated Malpighian tubules.

Parvalbumin (PARV) is an important calcium binding\nprotein that helps modulate intracellular calcium levels which set the size\nand shape of the muscle calcium transient. It therefore has a central role in\ndetermining the functional properties of the muscle.

This\nstudy is the first to show expression of all eight skeletal muscle PARV\nisoforms in carp at the protein level and relate regional differences in\nexpression to performance. All of the PARV isoforms were characterised at the\nprotein level using 2D-PAGE and tandem mass spectrometry.

Thus, hares in this climate build\nup large fat stores during winter that are then gradually depleted during the\nspring-to-autumn breeding season. We hypothesized that the diminishing fat\nstores of females over the breeding season might affect resource allocation,\npeak energy assimilation during lactation or the total investment in\noffspring. Therefore, we measured energy intake, milk quality and milk\nproduction throughout lactation in spring, summer and autumn in females\nraising (size-manipulated) litters with three young each, under a natural\nphotoperiod but at buffered ambient temperatures inside our facility. Over the\ncourse of the breeding season, the amount of milk production remained\nconstant, but the fat content of the milk decreased. Hence, total energy\ntransfer to young decreased significantly in autumn. By using undecanoic acid\nas a tracer of body fat mobilization, we were able to show that milk fat\npartially originated from maternal fat stores, particularly in spring. The\npeak sustained energy assimilation rates of lactating females were\nsignificantly higher in autumn, due to increased rates of food intake. We\nconclude that fat stores allow female hares to downregulate energy intake and\nexpenditure early in the breeding season, whereas late breeding forces them to\nreach peak energy intake levels. Accordingly, we suggest that in hares, peak\nenergy turnover during lactation varies with the availability of fat reserves.\nLimits to the sustained metabolic rate serve as variable constraints on\nreproductive investment. Thus, there might be a trade-off in energetic costs\nto mothers rearing early versus late litters in the year."},{"title":"Food deprivation during photosensitive and photorefractory life-history\nstages affects the reproductive cycle in the migratory Red-headed Bunting\n(Emberiza bruniceps)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/2/225","abstract":"In a seasonally breeding bird species, food deprivation affects\nreproduction.

To gain insight in the evolutionary transitions associated with\nthe evolution towards scraping, we analyzed prey capture kinematics in two\nspecies of benthic suction feeders which belong to taxa that are closely\nrelated to the scraper lineages (respectively, Corydoras splendens\nand Synodontis multipunctatus), and compared it to prey capture in a\nmore distantly related, generalist suction feeder (Clarias\ngariepinus). Simultaneous ventral and lateral view high-speed videos were\nrecorded to quantify the movements of the lower jaw, hyoid, pectoral girdle\nand neurocranium. Additionally, ellipse modeling was applied to relate head\nshape differences to buccal expansion kinematics. Similarly to what has been\nobserved in scrapers, rotations of the neurocranium are minimal in the benthic\nsuction feeders, and may consequently have facilitated the evolution of a\nscraping feeding mechanism. The hypothesis that fish with a more laterally\ncompressed head rely more heavily on lateral expansion of the buccal cavity to\ngenerate suction, was confirmed in our sample of catfish species. Since an\nimportant contribution of lateral expansion of the head to suction may avoid\nthe need for a strong, ventral depression of the mouth floor during feeding,\nwe hypothesized that this may have allowed a closer association with the\nsubstrate in the ancestors of scrapers. However, our hypothesis was not\nsupported by an ancestral state reconstruction, which suggests that scraping\nprobably evolved from sub-terminal mouthed ancestors with dorsoventrally\nflattened heads."},{"title":"Decreased precision contributes to the hypoxic thermoregulatory response in lizards","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/1/137","abstract":"The decrease in body temperature (Tb) observed in most\nvertebrate classes in response to hypoxia has been attributed to a regulated\ndecrease in set-point, protecting organs against tissue death due to oxygen\ndepletion.

In ectotherms, where\nthermoregulation is mainly behavioural, stressors that influence the\npropensity to move and respond to temperature gradients are expected to have\nan impact on thermoregulatory control. Using low oxygen as a potent stressor,\nwe evaluated the variability and level of thermoregulation of inland bearded\ndragons. To examine the source of thermoregulatory variability, we studied\ntheir behaviour in an electronically controlled temperature-choice shuttle\nbox, a constant temperature dual-choice shuttle box, and a linear thermal\ngradient. A significant increase in the size of the Tb\nrange was observed at the lowest oxygen concentration (4% O2),\nreflecting a decrease in thermoregulatory precision in the temperature-choice\nshuttle box. This was also accompanied by a drop of ∼2–4°C in\nTb, the drop being greatest in situations where\nTb must be actively defended. Situations that force the\nlizards to continually choose temperatures, rather than passively remain at a\ngiven temperature, lead to an increase in the variability in the manifested\nTb, which is further exaggerated in hypoxia. This study\nreveals that a decrease in thermoregulatory precision caused by a diminished\npropensity to move or effect appropriate thermoregulatory responses may be a\ncontributing component in the lowering of selected body temperatures observed\nin many hypoxic ectotherms."},{"title":"Mechanics and energetics of incline walking with robotic ankle exoskeletons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/1/32","abstract":"We examined healthy human subjects wearing robotic ankle exoskeletons to\nstudy the metabolic cost of ankle muscle–tendon work during uphill\nwalking.

The present study reveals that whereas both the left and right vagi\ninfluence fH, it is only the left vagus that influences\npulmonary vascular resistance. This is associated with the fact that\nrattlesnakes, in common with some other species of snakes, have a single\nfunctional lung, as the other lung regresses during development. Stimulation\nof the left cervical vagus in anaesthetised snakes slowed the heart and\nmarkedly reduced blood flow in the pulmonary artery whereas stimulation of the\nright cervical vagus slowed the heart and caused a small increase in stroke\nvolume (VS) in both the systemic and pulmonary\ncirculations.

A bilateral differentiation between the vagi was\nconfirmed by progressive vagotomy in recovered snakes.

The patterns of swimming effort and oxygen consumption\ncould be divided into three distinct phases: (1) the rapid fatigue phase from\n0 to 2 h when the mean swim thrust decreased from 45 to 30 mN and oxygen\nconsumption decreased from 33 to 18 ml h–1; (2) the slow\nfatigue phase from 2 to 12 h when the mean swim thrust decreased from 30 to 22\nmN and oxygen consumption decreased from 18 to 10 ml h–1; and\n(3) the sustained effort phase from 12 to 18 h when mean swim thrust averaged\n22 mN and oxygen consumption averaged 10 ml h–1.

GABA-positive fibers form a network on most acinar\nlobules and a dense plexus in the interior of a minor fraction of acinar\nlobules.

They begin a dive positively buoyant due to the\nlarge volume of air carried in their ventral air-stores, but rapidly enter a\nprotracted period of near-neutral buoyancy before becoming negatively buoyant.\nThis dive profile is due to haemoglobin found in large tracheated cells in the\nabdomen. Fibre optic oxygen probes placed in the air-stores of submerged bugs\nrevealed that oxygen partial pressure (PO2)\ndropped in a sigmoid curve, where a linear decline preceded a plateau between\n5.1 and 2.0 kPa, before a final drop. Buoyancy measurements made by attaching\nbackswimmers to a sensitive electronic balance showed the same three phases.\nInactivating the haemoglobin by fumigating backswimmers with 15% CO eliminated\nboth buoyancy and PO2 plateaus. Oxygen unloaded\nfrom the haemoglobin stabilises the air-store during the neutrally buoyant\nphase after a decrease in volume of between 16% and 19%.

Small arboreal primates would\nbenefit from these kinematics in their arboreal habitat but it has been\ndemonstrated that primates display certain differences in forelimb kinematics\nto other mammals. The objective of this paper is to find out whether these\nchanges in forelimb kinematics are related to changes in body size and limb\nproportions. As primates descended from small ancestors, a comparison between\nliving small primates and other small mammals makes it possible to determine\nthe polarity of character transformations for kinematic and morphometric\nfeatures proposed to be unique to primates. Walking kinematics of mouse\nlemurs, brown lemurs, cotton-top tamarins and squirrel monkeys was\ninvestigated using cineradiography. Morphometry was conducted on a sample of\n110 mammals comprising of primates, marsupials, rodents and carnivores. It has\nbeen shown that forelimb kinematics change with increasing body size in such a\nway that limb protraction increases but retraction decreases. Total forelimb\nexcursion, therefore, is almost independent of body size. Kinematic changes\nare linked to changes in forelimb proportions towards greater asymmetry\nbetween scapula and radius. Due to the spatial restriction inherent in the\ndiagonal footfall sequence of primates, forelimb excursion is influenced by\nthe excursion of the elongated hind limb. Hindlimb geometry, however, is\nhighly conserved, as has been previously shown. The initial changes in\nforelimb kinematics might, therefore, be explained as solutions to a\nconstraint rather than as adaptations to the particular demands of arboreal\nlocomotion."},{"title":"Physiological and morphological colour change in Antarctic krill,\nEuphausia superba: a field study in the Lazarev Sea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/24/3850","abstract":"Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is very susceptible to harmful\nsolar radiation because of its unique genetic setup.

Short-term physiological colour change and long-term\n(seasonal) morphological colour change are present. Both are facilitated by a\nsingle type of monochromatic red chromatophore, i.e. erythrophores, of\n20–450 μm diameter. Superficial erythrophores cover large dorsal\nareas, especially above vital organs (brain, sinus glands), additional\n`profound' erythrophores cover internal organs (heart, gut, nerve cords).\nShort-term change in light regime causes rapid physiological colour change\nalong dense bundles of microtubules: pigment disperses into chromorhizae upon\nexposure to PAR and UVA and to a lesser extent to UVB. Darkness leads to\naggregation of pigment in the centre and hence blanching. There is no\ncircadian rhythm in the dispersal state of erythrophores present in winter.\nPhysiological colour change in adult krill is two to three times more rapid in\nsummer than in winter. Furthermore, seasonal changes in light regime also\nresult in a profound morphological colour change: in summer animals, abdominal\nastaxanthin concentration is 450% and erythrophore count is 250–480%\nhigher than in winter krill.

Bats entered torpor overnight and\naroused the next day at a time corresponding to rising Ta\nand passive rewarming. The critical Ta (and torpid\nTb) for arousal was not fixed, however, but was lower when\nheating occurred later in the rest phase, providing the first evidence that\nthe critical arousal Ta is affected by time of the day.\nBats re-entered torpor in response to cooling late in the afternoon, yet\nalways aroused at lights off.

Foraging dives were characterized by a\ngliding descent, up to 15 lunges at depth, and an ascent powered by steady\nswimming. Longer dives were required to perform more lunges at depth and these\nextended apneas were followed by an increase in the number of breaths taken\nafter a dive. Maximum dive durations during foraging were approximately half\nof those previously reported for singing (i.e. non-feeding) humpback whales.\nAt the highest lunge frequencies (10 to 15 lunges per dive), respiratory rate\nwas at least threefold higher than that of singing humpback whales that\nunderwent a similar degree of apnea. These data suggest that the high\nenergetic cost associated with lunge feeding in blue and fin whales also\noccurs in intermediate sized rorquals."},{"title":"Honeybees can learn the relationship between the solar ephemeris and a newly-experienced landscape","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/23/3737","abstract":"Many species learn the sun's daily pattern of azimuthal movement (the solar\nephemeris function) for use in sun-compass orientation.

One\nsuch case involves the failure of transplanted bees to update their memories\nof the relationship between the solar ephemeris and a new landscape, even\nafter many days' experience at the new site. In the present study, I ask\nwhether the bees in previous transplantation experiments failed to update\ntheir memories of the relationship between the sun and landscape because the\nsource and recipient landscapes were (rotated) panoramic twins of each other,\neach dominated by a conspicuous treeline.

To determine whether this adaptive filter can\neliminate reafference created by brief and infrequent episodic behaviors like\nswimming in skates, we initiated a series of coupling tests in which an\nexternal electrosensory stimulus was coupled to short bouts of either parallel\nfiber stimulation or passive fin movements, and then measured the ability of\nAENs to generate a cancellation signal. Following five brief coupling periods\n(30–60 s) separated by long rest periods (1–9 min), 38.5% of the\nAENs developed a cancellation signal when the coupling was to parallel fiber\nstimulation, and 73% when the coupling was to passive fin movement.

In the first of two studies, we examined the\nassociation between nursing and vocal activity in ewes and their lambs during\nthe first 2 weeks of lactation.

Nursing therefore\nappears to play an important role in structuring very early vocal\ncommunication between the mother and her neonate.

We conducted two multiple choice field experiments\nusing egg traps with different light intensities and polarizations. With\ncontrolled illumination, a higher number of eggs was found under both high\nintensity and high polarization. Under natural illumination, no eggs were\nfound in the unpolarized traps, and the egg number increased with the\npercentage polarization regardless of the light intensity.

Furthermore, the percentage\npolarization is positively correlated with the total organic carbon (TOC)\nconcentration in the water. Orthogonal alignment of the microvilli found in\nommatidia from the ventral part of the female eye may provide the anatomical\nbasis for polarization sensitivity. We conclude that the percentage\npolarization of reflected light is the cue by which chironomid females choose\ntheir oviposition site.

Scaled models of filters were constructed from\nmaterials with elastic moduli comparable to material stiffnesses of\ninvertebrate appendages (1–177 GPa). These models were mounted on a sled\nto mimic the protrusion of filters away from an animal's body or from the\nsubstratum, and were towed through a vat of syrup to generate relative fluid\nmotion at low Reynolds numbers (Re <10–3, based\non cylinder diameter and tow speed).

Leakiness generally\nincreased with cylinder Re and distance from the filter base. At\nhigher flexibilities, however, streamwise bending and lateral narrowing of the\nfilter reduced projected area and slowed flow between elements.

Blade design strongly affects the work required to fragment biological\ntissues. A notched blade reduced the work to fracture of tissues tested by up\nto 600 J m–2 (50% reduction). The specific angle of the notch\nhad a significant effect, with acute angles more effectively reducing work to\nfracture. A bladed triangle matched to a notch reduced work to fracture more\nthan a notch–straight blade pair. Strain patterns seen while cutting\nphotoelastic gelatin indicate that the reduction in work to fracture with\ntriangular and notched blades arises from a combination of `trapping ability'\nand blade approach angle causing the material to fracture at lower overall\nstrain levels.

It was under these\ncircumstances that we conceived the honeybee dance as an autonomous\ninformation-processing system and asked whether or not such a system is\nsensitive to uncertainty of reward. Our results suggest that bees can tune\ntheir dancing according to the distribution of sugar reward among the several\nflowers of a patch, and that they seemingly do this based on the number–\n or the frequency – of their non-rewarding inspections to these\nflowers: the higher the number of non-rewarding inspections the lower the\nprobability of dancing.

No such pulses were observed during inter-compression\nperiods. Most pulses occurred on top of an existing level of CO2\nrelease, indicating that at least one spiracle was open when compression\nbegan.

As such, we measured single-pad friction\nand adhesion forces in sample hairy (Gastrophysa viridula) and smooth\n(Carausius morosus) pads and simultaneously recorded contact area.\nAdhesion and friction forces per unit pad area were very similar in smooth and\nhairy systems. Insect pads of both types adhere via a thin film of\nliquid secretion. As found previously for the smooth system, forces in the\nfibrillar system strongly decreased with larger amounts of fluid secretion\npresent, suggesting that the fluid mainly serves to maximize contact on rough\nsubstrates. One essential prerequisite for the control of surface attachment\nduring locomotion is the direction-dependence of adhesive pads. We compared\nthe mechanisms of direction-dependence in smooth and hairy systems by\nperforming proximal and distal slides. Both types of pad exhibited a large\ndrop in friction when moved away from the body, although this effect was more\nextreme for the hairy system. Direction-dependence is explained in both smooth\nand fibrillar systems by the instability of the tarsal chain, causing the\nwhole pad to peel off.

To determine whether or not\nRh proteins may also be involved in CO2 transport in rainbow trout,\nwe examined the effects of a 12 h exposure to external hypercapnia (1%\nCO2 in air) on Rh mRNA expression in the gill, skin and\nerythrocytes. External hypercapnic conditions lowered the water pH and\nfacilitated ammonia excretion; therefore, we also studied the effects of\nhypercapnia and normocapnia in the presence of 10 mmol l–1\nHepes-buffered water. Hepes treatment prevented water acidification, but\nresulted in elevated plasma ammonia levels and reduced ammonia excretion\nrates. Hypercapnia exposure without buffering did not elicit changes in Rh\nmRNA expression in the gill or skin. However, Rhcg2 mRNA expression\nwas downregulated in the gills and upregulated in the skin of both\nnormocapnia- and hypercapnia-exposed fish in Hepes-buffered water. mRNA\nexpression of a newly cloned Rhbg2 cDNA was downregulated in the skin\nof fish exposed to buffered water, and Rhag mRNA expression in\nerythrocytes was decreased with exposure to normocapnia in buffered water but\nnot with hypercapnia exposure in either buffered or unbuffered water.

Using a simple musculoskeletal model, it was\npredicted that the amount of energy stored in a tendon during a given movement\ndepends more critically on moment arm than on mechanical properties of the\ntendon, with the amount of stored energy increasing as the moment arm gets\nsmaller. Assuming a link between elastic energy reutilization and overall\nmetabolic cost of running, a smaller moment arm should therefore be associated\nwith superior running economy. This prediction was confirmed experimentally in\na group of 15 highly trained runners.

We find that the waggle dance encodes\ninformation about the total distance flown to the food source, even when\ncelestial compass cues are available only for a part of the journey.

Thus, when\nnavigating back to a food source, information about distance travelled is\ndisregarded when there is no concurrent input from the celestial compass.

In\na choice experiment with two foraging compartments, we investigated the\ninfluence of background noise on foraging effort and foraging success.

The degree to\nwhich the background noise deterred bats from the compartment increased from\ntraffic noise to vegetation movement noise to broadband computer-generated\nnoise. Vegetation noise, set 12 dB below the traffic noise amplitude, had a\nlarger repellent effect; presumably because of its acoustic similarity with\nprey sounds.

Three-dimensional models of domesticated goat (Capra\nhircus) skulls were constructed, with variable frontal bone and frontal\nsinus morphology, and loaded to simulate various head-butting behaviors. In\ngeneral, models with sinuses experienced higher strain energy values (a proxy\nfor shock absorption) than did models with unvaulted frontal bones, and the\nlatter often had higher magnitudes than models with solid vaulted frontal\nbones. Furthermore, vaulted frontal bones did not reduce magnitudes of\nprincipal strain on the surface of the endocranial cavity relative to models\nwith unvaulted frontal bones under most loading conditions.

This led to the `feeding modulation\nhypothesis', which states that rapid suction strikes are pre-programmed\nstereotyped events that proceed to completion once initiated regardless of\nsensory input. If this hypothesis holds true, successful strikes should be\nindistinguishable from unsuccessful strikes owing to a lack of feedback\ncontrol in specialized suction feeding fishes. The hydrodynamics of suction\nfeeding in white-spotted bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum) was\nstudied in three behaviours: successful strikes, intraoral transports of prey\nand unsuccessful strikes. The area of the fluid velocity region around the\nhead of feeding sharks was quantified using time-resolved digital particle\nimage velocimetry (DPIV). The maximal size of the fluid velocity region is 56%\nlarger in successful strikes than unsuccessful strikes (10.79 cm2\nvs 6.90 cm2), but they do not differ in duration,\nindicating that strikes are modulated based on some aspect of the prey or\nsimply as a result of decreased effort on the part of the predator. The\nhydrodynamic profiles of successful and unsuccessful strikes differ after 21\nms, a period probably too short to provide time to react through feedback\ncontrol. The predator-to-prey distance is larger in missed strikes compared\nwith successful strikes, indicating that insufficient suction is generated to\ncompensate for the increased distance. An accuracy index distinguishes\nunsuccessful strikes (–0.26) from successful strikes (0.45 to\n0.61). Successful strikes occur primarily between the horizontal axis\nof the mouth and the dorsal boundary of the ingested parcel of water, and\nmissed prey are closer to the boundary or beyond. Suction transports are\nshorter in duration than suction strikes but have similar maximal fluid\nvelocity areas to move the prey through the oropharyngeal cavity into the\noesophagus (54 ms vs 67 ms)."},{"title":"A glucagon-like endocrine pathway in Drosophila modulates both\nlipid and carbohydrate homeostasis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/19/3103","abstract":"The regulation of energy homeostasis is fundamental to all organisms.

The internal movement of\ncranial elements and pressure in the buccal, hyoid and pharyngeal cavities\nthat are directly responsible for suction generation was quantified using\nsonomicrometry and pressure transducers. Backward stepwise multiple linear\nregressions were used to explore the relationship between expansion and\npressure, accounting for 60–96% of the variation in pressure among\ncapture events. The progression of anterior to posterior expansion in the\nbuccal, hyoid and pharyngeal cavities is accompanied by the sequential onset\nof subambient pressure in these cavities as prey is drawn into the mouth. Gape\nopening triggers the onset of subambient pressure in the oropharyngeal\ncavities.

Interestingly, C. plagiosum generates large suction\npressures while paradoxically compressing the buccal cavity laterally,\ndelaying the time to peak pressure. This represents a fundamental difference\nfrom the mechanism used to generate suction in teleost fishes. Interestingly,\npressure in the three cavities peaks in the posterior to anterior direction.\nThe complex shape changes that the buccal cavity undergoes indicate that, as\nin teleosts, unsteady flow predominates during suction feeding.

Total water loss in\nP. capensis is 57 mg H2O h–1 at 20°C,\nsimilar to modern estimates for another onychophoran species. High relative\nrespiratory water loss rates (∼34%; estimated using a regression\ntechnique) suggest that the basal condition in arthropods may be a high\nrespiratory water loss rate.

One proposal is that an\nelastic element parallel to the cross-bridges becomes stiffer, or is engaged,\nwhen the muscle is activated and generates force when stretched. If this is\nindeed the sole mechanism, then rFE should be eliminated by subsequently\nshortening the muscle by a distance equal to or greater than the initial\nstretch.

In contrast to previous reports, we found that rapid shortening\ninduced a depression of subsequent isometric force.

With both methods of calculation, rFE\nwas significantly greater than zero when shortening distance was equal to\nstretch distance (P=0.0004 and P=0.03, respectively).\nTherefore, our hypothesis was not supported.

When turning\nupward, the birds use their buoyancy but they must work harder to turn\ndownward. Lift forces generated by the body were always directed ventrally.\nPropulsion improves the ability to make tight turns when the center of the\nturn is ventral to the birds. The neck produced only a small portion (10%) of\nthe normal vertical forces but its length may allow prey capture at the end of\npursuit, within the minimum turning radius."},{"title":"Fish and chips: functional genomics of social plasticity in an African cichlid fish","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/18/3041","abstract":"Behavior and physiology are regulated by both environment and social\ncontext. A central goal in the study of the social control of behavior is to\ndetermine the underlying physiological, cellular and molecular mechanisms in\nthe brain. The African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni has long\nbeen used as a model system to study how social interactions regulate neural\nand behavioral plasticity. In this species, males are either socially dominant\nand reproductively active or subordinate and reproductively suppressed. This\nphenotypic difference is reversible. Using an integrative approach that\ncombines quantitative behavioral measurements, functional genomics and\nbioinformatic analyses, we examine neural gene expression in dominant and\nsubordinate males as well as in brooding females. We confirm the role of\nnumerous candidate genes that are part of neuroendocrine pathways and show\nthat specific co-regulated gene sets (modules), as well as specific functional\ngene ontology categories, are significantly associated with either dominance\nor reproductive state. Finally, even though the dominant and subordinate\nphenotypes are robustly defined, we find a surprisingly high degree of\nindividual variation in the transcript levels of the very genes that are\ndifferentially regulated between these phenotypes.

As worker bees age they change castes, typically performing a\nsequence of different task sets (as `cell cleaners', `nurse bees', `food\nstorers' and `foragers'). Belonging to a caste could differentially impact the\nduration, constitution and periodicity of a bee's sleep. We observed\nindividually marked bees within observation hives to determine caste dependent\npatterns of sleep behavior. We conducted three studies to investigate the\nduration and periodicity of sleep when bees were outside comb cells, as well\nas duration of potential sleep when bees were immobile inside cells.\nAll four worker castes we examined exhibited a sleep state. As bees aged and\nchanged tasks, however, they spent more time and longer uninterrupted periods\nin a sleep state outside cells, but spent less time and shorter uninterrupted\nperiods immobile inside cells. Although c cleaners and nurse bees exhibited no\nsleep:wake rhythmicity, food storers and foragers experienced a 24 h\nsleep:wake cycle, with more sleep and longer unbroken bouts of sleep during\nthe night than during the day. If immobility within cells is an indicator of\nsleep, our study reveals that the youngest adult bees sleep the most, with all\nolder castes sleeping the same amount. This in-cell potential sleep may\ncompensate for what would otherwise indicate an exceptional increase of sleep\nin an aging animal."},{"title":"Natural odor ligands for olfactory receptor neurons of the female\nmosquito Aedes aegypti: use of gas chromatography-linked single\nsensillum recordings","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/18/3020","abstract":"Female Aedes aegypti are vectors of dengue and yellow fever.

This behaviour was followed by a free-travel phase, in\nwhich the mole rats appeared to locomote smoothly along the perimeter and\nthrough the centre of the arena while travelling faster with fewer stops or\nrepetitions of path segments. Familiarity with the environment was reflected\nin local shortcuts at the arena corners and global shortcuts (crosscuts)\nthrough the arena centre. We suggest that scanning the perimeter throughout\nthe build-up phase constitute a process of calibration, i.e. forming an\ninitial representation of the size and perhaps the shape of the environment–\n a sort of basic global map. We further suggest that this calibration\nis later used for navigation, as indicated by the emergence of global\ncrosscuts in the subsequent phase.

Analysis of material properties indicates that the tensile strength\nand extensibility of the silks employed by each species are identical over the\nentire size range of the species. Analysis of the breaking forces for\nindividual draglines, however, indicates that the draglines scale\nallometrically with the spider's body mass. For Araneus, breaking\nforce (N) scales with body mass (kg) as\nFmax=11.2M0.786, and the static safety factor\n(SBW=Fmax/Mg) scales as\nSBW=1.14M–0.214.

Analysis of these results suggests that the safety lines\nproduced by these two species are not able to absorb the impact energy of most\nfalls with a fixed length of pre-existing silk, except in the smallest of the\nAraneus spiders.

We used 240 Hz motion analysis (tracking 10\njoint markers) to measure the flexion/extension angles and angular velocities\nof the limb segments and joints for 288 strides across an eightfold range of\nspeeds (0.6–4.9 m s–1) and a sevenfold range of body\nmass (521–3684 kg). We show that the columnar limb orientation that\nelephants supposedly exemplify is an oversimplification – few segments\nor joints are extremely vertical during weight support (especially at faster\nspeeds), and joint flexion during the swing phase is considerable. The\n`inflexible' ankle is shown to have potentially spring-like motion, unlike the\nhighly flexible wrist, which ironically is more static during support.\nElephants use approximately 31–77% of their maximal joint ranges of\nmotion during rapid locomotion, with this fraction increasing distally in the\nlimbs, a trend observed in some other running animals. All angular velocities\ndecrease with increasing size, whereas smaller elephant limbs are not markedly\nmore flexed than adults. We find no major quantitative differences between\nAfrican and Asian elephant locomotion but show that elephant limb motions are\nmore similar to those of smaller animals, including humans and horses, than\ncommonly recognized.

Here we show that mechanosensory\nsignals are relayed to neighbouring nematocytes via chemical\nneurotransmission and that nematocytes receive synaptic input from surrounding\nnematocytes, hair cells and probably from epithelial cells. Intracellular\nvoltage recordings from stenotele nematocytes of capitate hydroid polyps\nshowed two distinct types of responses when other nematocytes within the same\ntentacle were mechanically stimulated: (i) graded depolarizations of variable\nduration (`L-potentials'), and (ii) uniform impulse-like, often repetitive\ndepolarizations (`T-potentials') that occurred in correlation with\ncontractions of epitheliomuscular cells. Voltage clamp experiments showed that\ndespite the stereotyped time course of T-potentials, their generation did not\ninvolve electrically excitable conductances. Instead, time course,\npost-stimulus delay, susceptibility to blockers of neurotransmission and gap\njunctions, and induction by electrical stimulation of other nematocytes\nindicate that L- and T-potentials are postsynaptic, most likely glutamatergic\npotentials.

In a\nvariety of vertebrates, multifocal optical systems compensate for longitudinal\nchromatic aberration by concentric zones of different refractive powers. Since\na constricting circular pupil blocks peripheral zones, eyes with multifocal\noptical systems often have slit pupils that allow light to pass through all\nzones, irrespective of the state of pupil constriction. Birds have circular\npupils and were therefore assumed to have monofocal optical systems. We\nexamined the eyes of 45 species (12 orders) of bird using videorefractometry,\nand the results are surprising: 29 species (10 orders) have multifocal\nsystems, and only five species (five orders) have monofocal systems. The\nresults from 11 species (four orders) are inconclusive. We propose that pupils\n`switching' between being fully opened (multifocal principle) to maximally\nclosed (pinhole principle) can make multifocal optical systems useful for\nanimals with circular pupils. Previous results indicate that mice have both\nmultifocal optical systems and switching pupils. Our results suggest that\nparrots may use a similar mechanism. By contrast, owl pupils responded weakly\nto changes in illumination and stayed remarkably wide even in full daylight.\nMoreover, the parrots opened their pupils at higher light levels than owls,\nwhich correlates with the differences in sensitivity between diurnal and\nnocturnal eyes."},{"title":"Allometry of evaporative water loss in marsupials: implications of the\neffect of ambient relative humidity on the physiology of brushtail possums\n(Trichosurus vulpecula)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/17/2759","abstract":"To better understand the effects of ambient relative humidity (RH) on\nphysiological variables and the implications of RH-correcting evaporative\nwater loss (EWL) data for marsupials, we examined the effect of RH on EWL,\nbody temperature (Tb), metabolic rate (MR) and thermal\nconductance (C) of the brushtail possum (Trichosurus\nvulpecula), a medium-sized marsupial.

In the present study, we ask how ontogenetic\nchanges in skull biomechanics affect the ability of bluegill sunfish, a\nhigh-performance suction feeder, to produce flow speeds and accelerations\nduring suction feeding. The flow of water in front of the mouth was measured\ndirectly for fish ranging from young-of-year to large adults, using digital\nparticle imaging velocimetry (DPIV). As bluegill size increased, the magnitude\nof peak flow speed they produced increased, and the effective suction distance\nincreased because of increasing mouth size. However, throughout the size\nrange, the timing of peak fluid speed remained unchanged, and flow was\nconstrained to approximately one gape distance from the mouth. The observed\nscaling relationships between standard length and peak flow speed conformed to\nexpectations derived from two biomechanical models, one based on morphological\npotential to produce suction pressure (the Suction Index model) and the other\nderived from a combination of morphological and kinematic variables (the\nExpanding Cone model). The success of these models in qualitatively predicting\nthe observed allometry of induced flow speed reveals that the scaling of\ncranial morphology underlies the scaling of suction performance in\nbluegill."},{"title":"Novel surfactant proteins are involved in the structure and stability of\nfoam nests from the frog Leptodactylus vastus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/16/2707","abstract":"Many amphibians lay their eggs in foam nests, which allow the eggs to be\ndeposited out of the water.

Similarly, in vivo analyses in adult flies\nconfirmed that JH is a hormonal immuno-suppressor.

For flying insects, the task is complicated\nby wind that distorts the plume and buffets the fly. To maintain an upwind\nheading, and thus stabilize their orientation in a plume, insects such as\nflies and moths make use of strong context-specific visual equilibrium\nreflexes. For example, flying straight requires the regulation of image\nrotation across the eye, whereas minimizing side-slip and avoiding a collision\nrequire regulation of image expansion. In flies, visual rotation stabilizes\nplume tracking, but rotation and expansion optomotor responses are controlled\nby separate visual pathways. Are olfactory signals integrated with optomotor\nresponses in a manner dependent upon visual context? We addressed this\nquestion by investigating the effect of an attractive food odor on active\noptomotor flight control. Odorant caused flies both to increase aerodynamic\npower output and to steer straighter. However, when challenged with wide-field\noptic flow, odor resulted in enhanced amplitude rotation responses but reduced\namplitude expansion responses. For both visual conditions, flies tracked\nmotion signals more closely in odor, an indication of increased saliency.\nThese results suggest a simple search algorithm by which olfactory signals\nimprove the salience of visual stimuli and modify optomotor control in a\ncontext-dependent manner, thereby enabling an animal to fly straight up a\nplume and approach odiferous objects."},{"title":"The role of the antennae during courtship behaviour in the parasitic wasp\nTrichopria drosophilae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/15/2486","abstract":"We have studied the courtship behaviour of Trichopria drosophilae\nPerkins (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae), a pupal parasitoid of the common fruit fly\nDrosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae), to\nunderstand the role of the antennae. Virgin pairs of the parasitoid perform an\nintense and stereotyped antennal courtship, which leads to copulation. During\nantennation, the two male fourth antennomeres come into contact with the two\napical female antennomeres, and thus the secretion produced by the sex\npheromone gland is spread onto the female receptors. By preventing the\ntransfer of the courtship pheromone from male to female antennae, mating was\ninhibited. Moreover, selective ablation of single antennae demonstrated that\nthe courtship pheromone acts on contact. When antennae of both sexes were\npartially removed (ablation at the same side, i.e. right or left) courtship\nwas successful and copulation occurred. In contrast, in the case of antennal\nablation at opposite sides, courtship failed despite the short distance\nbetween secretion and receptors.

We\nsuggest that the T-cell has divergent functions within the Tettigoniidae,\nincluding predator and mate detection, and the function could be context\ndependent in some species."},{"title":"Caste differences in venom volatiles and their effect on alarm behaviour\nin the paper wasp Polistes dominulus (Christ)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/15/2442","abstract":"Foundresses and workers of Polistes paper wasps show slight\nmorphological and physiological differences. However, after the emergence of\nthe workers, the castes can be readily discriminated by their behaviour: the\ndominant foundress is the principal egg-layer, whereas workers perform\ndifferent tasks linked to colony development. Previous studies have\ndemonstrated in this genus that defence of the colony by the workers is more\neffectively carried out by a collective response elicited by venom volatiles\nused as alarm pheromones. In the present study, gas chromatography–mass\nspectrometry analyses of the venom volatiles of foundresses and workers of\nPolistes dominulus (Christ) show predominantly quantitative\ndifferences. Spiroacetals, mainly\n(E,E)-2,8-dimethyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane, are significantly\nhigher in the venom volatiles fraction of workers, whereas the amount of\nN-(3-methylbutyl)acetamide is almost double in foundresses. On the\nbasis of the chemical results, behavioural assays were performed on fifteen\nfield colonies to test the alarm response of the resident wasps to venom\nextracts from foundresses and workers. Our behavioural results suggest that\nworker venom has a stronger alarm effect on the colonies than that of the\nfoundresses, which seems unable to elicit the complete alarm response ending\nwith a final attack and sting. The venom volatiles of P. dominulus\nworkers serve mainly to alarm the colony whilst those of foundresses may also\nbe linked to additional functions related to conspecific interactions."},{"title":"Vocal identity and species recognition in male Australian sea lions,\nNeophoca cinerea","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/14/2288","abstract":"The acoustic channel is important for communication in otariids (fur seals\nand sea lions). Discrimination between species, sex or individuals is\nessential in communication; therefore insight into the role of vocalisations\nin recognition is vital to understanding otariid social interactions. We\nmeasured vocalisations and their use in discriminating sex and species in male\nAustralian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea). Barking calls of mature\nmales were recorded and analysed based on five acoustic parameters. A\ndiscriminant function analysis classified calls to the correct individual at a\nclassification rate of 56%, suggesting that male barking calls are\nindividually distinctive with the potential to facilitate individual vocal\nrecognition. Playback experiments were used to assess the role of\nvocalisations in sex and species recognition both in and out of the breeding\nseason. Males showed significantly stronger reactions to both conspecific and\nheterospecific males than they did to conspecific females and were most\nresponsive during the breeding season. Australian sea lion males have the most\ndepauperate vocal repertoire of any otariid. This simple repertoire may\nreflect the ecological circumstances in which these animals breed, with very\nlow colony densities, asynchronous breeding and low levels of polygyny. Yet\neven in this simple system, males are able to discriminate between males and\nfemales of their own species, and distinguish the calls of conspecifics from\nother species. The barking calls of male Australian sea lions have sufficient\ninformation embedded to provide the potential for individual discrimination\nand this ability will be assessed in future studies."},{"title":"In vivo regulation of rainbow trout lipolysis by\ncatecholamines","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/15/2460","abstract":"Lipolysis provides fatty acids that support key life processes by\nfunctioning as membrane components, oxidative fuels and metabolic signals.

Therefore, the goals of this study\nwere, first, to characterize the effects of the catecholamines norepinephrine\n(NE) and epinephrine (Epi) on the lipolytic rate of intact rainbow trout\n(Oncorhynchus mykiss) and, second, to determine whether the plasma\nglycerol concentration is a reliable index of Ra glycerol.\nOur results show that baseline Ra glycerol (4.6±0.4μ\nmol kg–1 min–1) is inhibited by NE\n(–56%), instead of being stimulated, as in mammals, whereas Epi has the\nsame activating effect in both groups of vertebrates (+167%). NE-induced\ninhibition of fish lipolysis might play a particularly important role during\naquatic hypoxia, when survival often depends on regulated metabolic\ndepression.

Levels of mRNA for NHE2, the predominant isoform in the gill, were\nincreased during 72 h of hypercapnic acidosis; NHE3 mRNA and protein levels\nwere unaffected. Because plasma cortisol levels were increased during\nhypercapnia (from 35.3±9.4 to 100.1±30.9 ng\nml–1), the effects of experimentally elevated cortisol levels\non NHE expression were investigated. The elevation of plasma cortisol using\nintraperitoneal implants caused a significant increase in NHE2 mRNA expression\nwithout affecting NHE3 mRNA or protein abundance.

Plume tracking males that experienced the total\nloss of directional air flow halfway to the odor source showed little change\nin their performance, and 100% were able to quickly locate the pheromone\nsource.

We show that the LG and MG exhibited an\nincrease in force and stress with a change in gait and an increase in\nlocomotor speed, but not with changes in incline. While the LG and MG\nexhibited similar levels of stress when walking at 0.5 m s–1,\nstress in the LG was 1.8 times greater than in the MG when running at 2.0 m\ns–1. Fascicle shortening increased with an increase in speed\non both inclines for the LG, but only on the level for the pMG. Positive work\nperformed by the LG exceeded that of the pMG and dMG for all conditions, and\nthis difference was magnified when locomotor speed increased. Within the MG,\nthe pMG shortened more, and at a faster rate than the dMG, resulting in a\ngreater amount of positive work performed by the pMG. Mean spike amplitude of\nthe electromyogram (EMG) bursts increased for all muscle locations with an\nincrease in speed, but changes with incline were more variable. The functional\ndifferences between the LG and MG are likely due to the different moments each\nexerts at the knee, as well as differences in motor unit recruitment. The\ndifferences within the MG are likely due to motor unit recruitment\ndifferences, but also differences in architecture. Fascicles within the dMG\ninsert into an extensive aponeurosis, which results in a higher apparent\ndynamic stiffness relative to fascicles operating within the pMG. On the level\nsurface, the greater compliance of the pMG leads to increased stretch of its\nfascicles at the onset of force, further enhancing force production.

This paper disputes the key role\ngenerally accredited to octopamine in activating the CPG for insect flight. In\ndeafferented locusts, fictive flight was initiated by bath application of the\nmuscarinic agonist pilocarpine, the acetylcholine analogue carbachol, and the\nacetylcholinesterase blocker eserine, but not by nicotine. Furthermore, in\naddition to octopamine, various other amines including dopamine, tyramine and\nhistamine all induced fictive flight, but not serotonin or the amine-precursor\namino acid tyrosine. However, flight initiation was not reversibly blocked by\naminergic antagonists, and was still readily elicited by both natural\nstimulation (wind) and pilocarpine in reserpinized, amine-depleted locusts. By\ncontrast, the muscarinic antagonists atropine and scopolamine reversibly\nblocked flight initiated by wind, cholinergic agonists, octopamine, and by\nselective stimulation of a flight-initiating interneurone (TCG). The short\ndelay from TCG stimulation to flight onset suggests that TCG acts directly on\nthe flight CPG, and accordingly that TCG, or its follower cell within the\nflight generating circuit, is cholinergic. We conclude that acetylcholine\nacting via muscarinic receptors is the key neurotransmitter in the\nmechanism underlying the natural activation of the locust flight CPG. Amines\nare not essential for this, but must be considered as potential\nneuromodulators for facilitating flight release and tuning the motor pattern.\nWe speculate that muscarinic activation coupled to aminergic facilitation may\nbe a general feature of behavioural control in insects for ensuring\nconditional recruitment of individual motor programs in accordance with\nmomentary adaptive requirements."},{"title":"Phylogeny, scaling, and the generation of extreme forces in trap-jaw ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/14/2358","abstract":"Trap-jaw ants of the genus Odontomachus produce remarkably fast\npredatory strikes.

We manipulated the\nconcentration of sugar solutions available to ant colonies (dilute, medium and\nconcentrated solutions) over extended periods and measured the capacity of\ncolonies to maintain sugar supply through compensatory feeding. First, we\ndemonstrated that ants regulated carbohydrate intake at a collective and\nindividual level. Initially, ants consumed most and recruited fastest in\nresponse to more concentrated than to dilute sugar solutions, but over time\nthis pattern reversed, such that the number of ants that fed and the volume\ningested by each ant was a negative function of sugar concentration in the\ndiet. Second, we found that ants became better at regulating their\ncarbohydrate intake with the production of larvae in the nest. When the number\nof larvae was experimentally doubled, the ants regulated their consumption of\ncarbohydrates more accurately than when the number of adult workers was\ndoubled, suggesting that larvae play an important role in providing\nnutritional feedback to workers.

We then accounted for the actual thread elongation achieved\nfor each individual's threads and for differences in the five species'\nabsolute thread extensibility. The results showed that in four species thread\nextensibility contributed positively to adhesion. For three species, thread\nextensibility and droplet volume together explained the mean per droplet\nadhesion of threads. Models based on these three species show that, as threads\nwere elongated, increasing amounts of potential adhesion were lost to\ndiminished axial fiber extensibility.

Phylogenetic sequence\ncomparisons indicate that it is not homologous to any known vertebrate Kir\nchannel, yet belongs to the Kir2 subfamily.

Speed was not higher for bipedal strides, compared with\nquadrupedal strides, in any of the four species, but acceleration during\nbipedal strides was significantly higher in three of four species.\nFurthermore, a distinct threshold between quadrupedal and bipedal strides, was\nmore evident for acceleration than speed, with a threshold in acceleration\nabove which strides became bipedal.

In a rotating environment, the fly's behaviour typically changes towards\ndistinct, concentric circular flight paths where the radius of the paths\nincreases with increasing arena velocity. The EMD simulation suggests that\nthis behaviour is driven by a rotation-sensitive EMD detector system that\nminimizes retinal slip on each compound eye, whereas an expansion-sensitive\nEMD system with a laterally centred visual focus potentially helps to achieve\ncentring response on the circular flight path. We developed a numerical model\nbased on force balance between horizontal, vertical and lateral forces that\nallows predictions of flight path curvature at a given locomotor capacity of\nthe fly. The model suggests that turning flight in Drosophila is\nconstrained by the production of centripetal forces needed to avoid side-slip\nmovements. At maximum horizontal velocity this force may account for up to 70%\nof the fly's body weight during yaw turning. Altogether, our analyses are\nwidely consistent with previous studies on Drosophila free flight and\nthose on the optomotor response under tethered flight conditions."},{"title":"Scallops visually respond to the size and speed of virtual particles","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/13/2066","abstract":"The unique eyes of scallops are abundant along the right and left valve\nmantle margins.

The decrease in\nthe entropic component with extension is due to the presence of relatively\nshort and conformationally restricted network chains in Araneus MA\nsilk. Experiments on hydrated Araneus FL silk (proline content 16%)\nindicate that entropy elasticity dominates the elastic mechanism up to\nextensions of 100% and beyond, which likely reflects the fact that the\nglycine-rich network chains in FL silk are longer and less conformationally\nrestricted than those in the MA silk.

Myoelectric and\nsonomicrometric data were collected from the three ankle extensor muscles of\nthe rat hind limb during walking and running. Myoelectric signals were\nanalysed using wavelet transformation and principal component analysis to give\na measure of the signal frequency content. Sonomicrometric signals were\nanalysed to give measures of muscle fascicle strain and strain rate. The\nrelationship between myoelectric frequency and both intensity and muscle\nfascicle strain rate was found to change across the time course of a stride,\nwith differences also occurring in the strength of the associations between\nand within muscles. In addition to the orderly recruitment of motor units, a\nmechanical strategy of motor unit recruitment was therefore identified. Motor\nunit recruitment is therefore a multifactorial phenomenon, which is more\ncomplex than typically thought."},{"title":"Slow desiccation improves dehydration tolerance and accumulation of\ncompatible osmolytes in earthworm cocoons (Dendrobaena octaedra\nSavigny)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/12/1903","abstract":"The earthworm, Dendrobaena octaedra, is a common species in\ntemperate and subarctic regions of the northern hemisphere.

The question remains, however, of how informative a small\nsample of waggle phases can be to the bees, and how the spatial information\nencoded in the dance is actually mapped to the followers' searches in the\nfield. Certainly, it is the variability of a dancer's performance that\ninitially defines the level of uncertainty that followers must cope with if\nthey were to successfully decode information in the dance.

Here we describe within-individual\nvariations in the encoding of the distance to and direction of a goal. We show\nthat variations in the number of a dancer's wagging movements, a measure that\ncorrelates well with the distance to the goal, do not depend upon the dancer's\ntravelled distance, meaning that there is a constant variance of wagging\nmovements around the mean.

The\nrelative expression and distribution of these aromatic NATs were examined with\ntransporter-specific antibodies in Xenopus oocytes and mosquito\nlarval alimentary canal, representing heterologous and tissue expression\nsystems, respectively. NAT-specific aromatic-substrate-induced currents\nstrongly corresponded with specific accumulation of both transporters in the\nplasma membrane of oocytes. Immunolabeling revealed elevated expressions of\nboth transporters in specific regions of the larval alimentary canal,\nincluding salivary glands, cardia, gastric caeca, posterior midgut and\nMalpighian tubules. Differences in relative expression densities and spatial\ndistribution of the transporters were prominent in virtually all of these\nregions, suggesting unique profiles of the aromatic amino acid absorption.

Both aromatic NATs formed putative homodimers in the larval gut\nwhereas functional monomers were over-expressed heterologously in\nXenopus oocytes. The results unequivocally suggest functional synergy\nbetween substrate-specific AgNAT6 and AgNAT8 in intracellular absorption of\naromatic amino acids.

Species with single,\nnon-encapsulated, free airbladders possess one, three or four ossicles,\nwhereas species with encapsulated bladders possess one or two. The relative\nsizes of the bladders and ossicles were significantly smaller in the latter\ngroup. All species were able to detect sound stimuli between 50 Hz and 5 kHz.\nInterspecific differences in hearing sensitivity varied at most by 24 dB below\n1 kHz, whilst this variation increased to more than 50 dB at higher\nfrequencies. Catfishes with free bladders had lower thresholds above 1 kHz\nthan those having encapsulated ones. The relative lengths of swimbladders and\nof ossicular chains were correlated with hearing sensitivity above 1 and 2\nkHz, respectively. The number of ossicles affected hearing at 4 and 5 kHz.\nThese results indicate that larger bladders and ossicles as well as higher\nossicle numbers improve hearing ability at higher frequencies in catfishes.

At the standard height, subjects also walked down wearing a\nweighted jacket carrying 20% extra body mass. Lower limb kinematics and\nkinetics were determined using motion capture and ground reaction forces.

The GM muscle fascicles shortened more\nwhen step-height was increased, which corresponded to the increase in ankle\njoint moment. Increased body mass did not alter the ankle or knee joint moment\nin the first contact phase of a step down; due to a change in strategy, the\ntrailing leg, instead of the leading leg, supported the extra mass. Hence, the\namount of GM muscle fascicle shortening, during the touch-down phase, also did\nnot change with added body mass.

It has been suggested that the skin may function as a secretory\npathway or a reservoir for Ca2+ recycling. To test this hypothesis,\nwe studied the dermis and epidermis of female and male chickens in\nvivo to find out whether cellular mechanisms exist for the accumulation,\nrecycling or secretion of Ca2+. For calcium influx and\nintracellular Ca2+ release, respectively, the density of\ndihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) was examined,\nusing high-affinity (–)-enantiomers of dihydropyridine and ryanodine\nlabelled with fluorophores. To investigate Ca2+ utilization in the\nskin, the systemic and local activity of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP)\nand the concentration of ionic Ca2+ were measured in plasma and in\ncutaneous extracellular fluid, collected by suction blister technique. We\nfound that both DHPRs and RyRs were present in all skin layers from dermis to\nhorny layer. However, receptor densities were highest in the surface layers.\nWith a basic calcium-rich diet, receptor densities were higher in males,\nparticularly in the dermis and mid-epidermis. After a reduction in the\nnutritional Ca2+ input, receptor densities in males decreased to\nthe same level as in females, in which the receptor densities were not\naffected by the amount of Ca2+ in the diet or that resulting from\ncoming out of lay. The extracellular concentration of ionic Ca2+\nper se was not found to affect the density of DHPRs and RyRs in the\nskin. Spatially, RyRs seem to be located in the periphery of the\nsebokeratinocyte. ALP activity was shown to be lower in the extracellular\nfluid than in the plasma in both sexes. However, activity in both\nextracellular domains increased significantly in females that had come out of\nlay.

In conclusion,\nvoltage-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels for ion influx and RyRs for\nCa2+ release are present in the cells of the skin of female and\nmale chickens. Higher densities in the males receiving excessive\nCa2+ imply an increased capacity for Ca2+ influx and\nintracellular processing. Even though the functional interactions between\nDHPRs and RyRs in the sebokeratinocytes could not be demonstrated, peripheral\ncolocation and high receptor densities at the level of exocytosis of the\nlamellar bodies point to their role as part of a signalling pathway for\nsecretion.

It was found that the\nintermediate peaks seen in the ERG polarization sensitivity curves were\neliminated after application of cobalt, suggesting that these peaks are due to\nouter retinal inhibition derived from feedback of horizontal cells onto cones.\nA simple computational model was developed to evaluate these results. The\nmodel consists of opponent and non-opponent processing elements for the two\npolarization detectors. This model provides a first approximation analysis\nsuggesting that opponent processing occurs in the outer retina for\npolarization vision. Although it seems that polarization vision uses a\nslightly more complicated coding scheme than colour vision, the results\npresented in this paper suggest that opponent and non-opponent channels\nprocess polarization information."},{"title":"The pyloric neural circuit of the herbivorous crab Pugettia\nproducta shows limited sensitivity to several neuromodulators that elicit\nrobust effects in more opportunistically feeding decapods","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/9/1434","abstract":"Modulation of neural circuits in the crustacean stomatogastric nervous\nsystem (STNS) allows flexibility in the movements of the foregut musculature.\nThe extensive repertoire of such resulting motor patterns in dietary\ngeneralists is hypothesized to permit these animals to process varied foods.\nThe foregut and STNS of Pugettia producta are similar to those of\nother decapods, but its diet is more uniform, consisting primarily of kelp.

The experiment increased\nfemale plasma carotenoids, but this effect was not apparent in hatchling and\nfledgling plasma carotenoid concentration. Also, results showed that\ncarotenoid supplementation increased the high density lipoprotein to low\ndensity lipoprotein ratio in adult females, suggesting that dietary\ncarotenoids may influence lipid metabolism. Furthermore, the effect of the\ntreatment was manifested in several nestling health state parameters.\nNestlings of carotenoid-supplemented females were infested by less intestinal\nparasite groups, had higher lymphocyte concentrations in blood plasma, and\nwere less stressed (heterophile to lymphocyte ratio) than control nestlings.\nIn addition, an interaction between the experimental treatment and nestling\nsex was apparent for globulin concentrations, favouring the smaller male\nnestlings. Thereby, suggesting that males benefited more than females from an\nincrease in maternal carotenoid investment.

We\ncombined morphological and physiological approaches to study specialization in\nthe SMR and CMP fibres of the long-finned squid Doryteuthis pealeii.\nThe mean thick filament length was 3.12±0.56 μm and 1.78±0.27μ\nm for the SMR and CMP fibres, respectively. The cross-sectional areas of\nthe whole fibre and the core of mitochondria were significantly higher in the\nSMR fibres, but the area occupied by the myofilaments did not differ between\nthe two fibre types. The area of sarcoplasmic reticulum visible in cross\nsections was significantly higher in CMP fibres than in SMR fibres. In live\nbundles of muscle fibres partially isolated from the mantle, mean peak\nisometric stress during tetanus was significantly greater in SMR [335 mN\nmm–2 physiological cross section (pcs)] than in CMP (216 mN\nmm–2 pcs) fibres.

Two species with the same jumping\ncharacteristics but distinctively different body shapes were analysed:\nUlopa, which had an average body length of 3 mm and was squat, and\nCephalelus, which had an average body length of 13 mm with an\nelongated body and head. In both, the hind legs were only 1.4 times longer\nthan the front legs compared with 1.9–2.3 times in other cicadellid\nleafhoppers. When the length of the hind legs was normalised relative to the\ncube root of their body mass, their hind legs had a value of 1–1.1\ncompared with 1.6–2.3 in other cicadellids. The hind legs of\nCephalelus were only 20% of the body length.

Previous\ntheoretical studies suggested that the near-helical arrangement of these\nfibres results in a (fairly) uniform distribution of fibre strain and work\noutput during swimming. However, the underlying simplifications of these\nstudies precluded unequivocal support for this hypothesis. We studied the fast\nmuscle-fibre reorientation and the concomitant myotomal strain variance in a\nbody segment near the anus during larval and juvenile development in the\nzebrafish. From 2 to 4 days post fertilization (d.p.f.), the measured angles\nbetween the muscle fibres and the longitudinal axis of the zebrafish were\nsmall. Yet, onset of a near-helical muscle-fibre arrangement was recognized.\nJuveniles of 51 d.p.f. have larger mean fibre angles and already possess the\nnear-helical pattern of adult teleosts. We present a model that computes the\ndistribution of the strain along the muscle fibres from measured muscle-fibre\norientations, body curvature and prescribed tissue deformations. We selected\nthe most extreme body curvatures, which only occur during fast starts and\nturning manoeuvres. Using the model, we identified the (non-linear) tissue\ndeformations that yield the least variance in the muscle-fibre strain. We show\nthat simple beam theory cannot reliably predict the strain distribution: it\nresults in very small strains and negligible work output of the most medial\nfibres. In our model, we avoided these functional limitations by adding a\nshear deformation to the simple beam deformation. At 2 d.p.f., the predicted\nvariance in the muscle-fibre strain for the shear deformation optimized for\nstrain uniformity is fairly small, due to the small variation in the fibre\ndistances to the medial plane that is caused by the relatively large spinal\ncord and notochord. The predicted minimal strain variance increases sharply\nfrom 2 d.p.f. to 3 d.p.f., remains relatively large at 4 d.p.f., but decreases\nagain considerably at 15 and 39 d.p.f. The 51 d.p.f. stage exhibits the\nsmallest variance in the fibre strains (for the identified optimal\ndeformation), in spite of the widely varying muscle-fibre distances to the\nmedial plane. The non-linear nature of the body deformations with the least\nstrain variance implies an interesting optimization constraint: the juvenile\nmuscle-fibre arrangement results in small predicted spatial strain variations\nat large-amplitude body curvatures, at the (modest) expense of a large\ncoefficient of variation for small curvatures. We conclude that larval fish\nrapidly change their muscle-fibre orientations (probably in response to\nmechanical signals). Within the theoretically examined plausible range of\ndeformations, the closest correspondence to a uniform strain field was found\nfor the juvenile stage."},{"title":"Estimating maximum performance: effects of intraindividual variation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/8/1336","abstract":"Researchers often estimate the performance capabilities of animals using a\nsmall number of trials per individual.

A regulated\nincrease in heat loss contributed to Tb depression as\nreflected by increases in bill surface temperatures (up to 5°C) during\nhypoxia. Bill warming required peripheral chemoreceptor inputs, since vagotomy\nabolished this response to hypoxia.

However, when\nTb depression or bill warming were expressed relative to\narterial O2 concentration (rather than inspired O2) all\nspecies were similar; this suggests that enhanced O2 loading,\nrather than differences in thermoregulatory control centres, reduces\nTb depression during hypoxia in bar-headed geese.\nCorrespondingly, bar-headed geese maintained higher rates of metabolism during\nsevere hypoxia (7% inspired O2), but this was only partly due to\ndifferences in Tb.

However, data from a broader functional and\nphylogenetic range of species are critical for understanding the evolution of\nlimb bone function and design. Turtles are an interesting lineage in this\ncontext. Although their slow walking speeds and robust limb bones might lead\nto low locomotor forces and limb bone stresses similar to other non-avian\nreptiles, their highly sprawled posture could produce high bending loads,\nleading to high limb bone stresses similar to those of avian and mammalian\nspecies, as well as high torsion. To test between these possibilities, we\nevaluated stresses experienced by the femur of river cooter turtles\n(Pseudemys concinna) during terrestrial walking by synchronizing\nmeasurements of three-dimensional joint kinematics and ground reaction forces\n(GRFs) during isolated hindlimb footfalls.

Peak bending stresses experienced by the femur were\nlow (tensile: 24.9±9.0 MPa; compressive: –31.1±9.1 MPa)\nand comparable to those in other reptiles, yet peak shear stresses were higher\nthan those in other reptiles, averaging 13.7±4.2 MPa.

Male blue crabs, Callinectes\nsapidus, have a courtship display in which they elevate their body by\nstanding high on their legs, open their chelae and paddle their swimming legs.\nThis courtship display is not reported in other swimming (portunid) crabs and\nis rarely expressed in laboratory experiments on male blue crabs. In this\nstudy, we characterised this display, which we call `courtship stationary\npaddling', and distinguished it from other types of paddling. To explain the\nspecies specificity of courtship stationary paddling, we hypothesised that\nthis behaviour is an adaptation to low visibility and abundant refuges in the\nhabitat of blue crabs, and that this behaviour enhances chemical signalling\nwhen females are relatively inaccessible to males. We used particle imaging\nvelocimetry to visualise water currents generated during courtship stationary\npaddling, showing that it created water currents directed away from the male\nand towards the female, thus enhancing chemical signalling. We also showed\nthat males did not perform courtship stationary paddling when females were\nfreely walking such that males could quickly contact and cradle carry them.\nRather, males typically performed courtship stationary paddling only when\nfemales were inaccessible to them. These results indicate that courtship\nstationary paddling is a context-dependent behaviour, occurring only when\nfemales are not accessible to males, and suggesting that it evolved as an\nadaptation to life in habitats with many refuges and low visibility."},{"title":"Cold induced changes of adenosine levels in common eelpout (Zoarces\nviviparus): a role in modulating cytochrome c oxidase\nexpression","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/8/1262","abstract":"Exposure of ectothermic organisms to variations in temperatures causes a\ntransient mismatch between energy supply and demand, which needs to be\ncompensated for during acclimation.

Pigeons (Columba livia) were\ntrained to fly at varying angles of ascent and descent (60°, 30°,\n0°, –30°, –60°), and were recorded using high-speed\nvideo. Detailed three-dimensional kinematics were obtained from the\nrecordings, allowing analysis of wing movement. Aerodynamic forces and power\nrequirements were then estimated from kinematic data.

We found\nthat the total power output for flight at various angles was not different\nfrom the sum of power required for level flight and the PE rate of\nchange for a given angle, except for the steep –60° descent. The\ntotal power for steep descent was higher than this sum because of a higher\ninduced power due to the bird's deceleration and slower flight velocity.\nAerodynamic force estimates during mid-downstroke did not differ significantly\nin magnitude or orientation among flight angles. Pigeons flew fastest during–\n30° flights (4.9±0.1 m s–1) and slowest at\n60° (2.9±0.1 m s–1).

Branchial\nNa+/K+-ATPase levels were ∼ tenfold higher in\ntransformers compared to ammocoetes and salinity did not affect expression in\neither group. However, branchial H+-ATPase expression showed a\nnegative correlation with salinity in both groups.\nNa+/K+-ATPase immunoreactivity was strongest in\ntransformers and associated with clusters of cells in the interlamellar\nspaces. H+-ATPase (B subunit) immunoreactivity was localized to\nepithelial cells not expressing high Na+/K+-ATPase\nimmunoreactivity and having a similar tissue distribution as carbonic\nanhydrase.

Here we focus on Gnathonemus\npetersii (Günther 1862), an African fish of the family Mormyridae\nwith a characteristic chin appendix, the Schnauzenorgan. Behavioural and\nanatomical results suggest that the mobile Schnauzenorgan and the nasal region\nserve special functions in electroreception, and can therefore be considered\nas electric foveae.

These mechanisms allow the fish to focus the\nelectric field at the tip of its Schnauzenorgan where the density of\nelectroreceptors is highest (tip-effect). Currents are funnelled by the open\nmouth (funnelling-effect), which leads to a homogenous voltage distribution in\nthe nasal region.

The metabolic pathway by which larvae\naccomplish these functions has anionic and cationic components that interact\nand allow the larva to conserve Na+ while excreting H+\nand HCO3–. The anionic pathway consists of a\nmetabolic CO2 diffusion process, carbonic anhydrase and\nCl–/HCO3– exchangers; it provides\nweak HCO3– and weaker\nCO32– anions to the lumen. The cationic pathway\nconsists of H+ V-ATPases and Na+/H+\nantiporters (NHAs), Na+/K+ P-ATPases and\nNa+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) along with several\n(Na+ or K+):amino acid+/– symporters,\na.k.a. nutrient amino acid transporters (NATs). This paper considers the\ncationic pathway, which provides the strong Na+ or K+\ncations that alkalinize the lumen in anterior midgut then removes them and\nrestores a lower pH in posterior midgut. A key member of the cationic pathway\nis a Na+/H+ antiporter, which was cloned recently from\nAnopheles gambiae larvae, localized strategically in plasma membranes\nof the alimentary canal and named AgNHA1 based upon its phylogeny. A\nphylogenetic comparison of all cloned NHAs and NHEs revealed that AgNHA1 is\nthe first metazoan NHA to be cloned and localized and that it is in the same\nclade as electrophoretic prokaryotic NHAs that are driven by the electrogenic\nH+ F-ATPase. Like prokaryotic NHAs, AgNHA1 is thought to be\nelectrophoretic and to be driven by the electrogenic H+ V-ATPase.\nBoth AgNHA1 and alkalophilic bacterial NHAs face highly alkaline environments;\nto alkalinize the larva mosquito midgut lumen, AgNHA1, like the bacterial\nNHAs, would have to move nH+ inwardly and Na+ outwardly.\nPerhaps the alkaline environment that led to the evolution of electrophoretic\nprokaryotic NHAs also led to the evolution of an electrophoretic AgNHA1 in\nmosquito larvae. In support of this hypothesis, antibodies to both AgNHA1 and\nH+ V-ATPase label the same membranes in An. gambiae\nlarvae. The localization of H+ V-ATPase together with\n(Na+ or K+):amino acid+/– symporter,\nAgNAT8, on the same apical membrane in posterior midgut cells constitutes the\nfunctional equivalent of an NHE that lowers the pH in the posterior midgut\nlumen. All NATs characterized to date are Na+ or K+\nsymporters so the deduction is likely to have wide application. The deduced\ncolocalization of H+ V-ATPase, AgNHA1 and AgNAT8, on this membrane\nforms a pathway for local cycling of H+ and Na+ in\nposterior midgut. The local H+ cycle would prevent unchecked\nacidification of the lumen while the local Na+ cycle would regulate\npH and support Na+:amino acid+/– symport.\nMeanwhile, a long-range Na+ cycle first transfers Na+\nfrom the blood to gastric caeca and anterior midgut lumen where it initiates\nalkalinization and then returns Na+ from the rectal lumen to the\nblood, where it prevents loss of Na+ during H+ and\nHCO3– excretion. The localization of H+\nV-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase in An. gambiae\nlarvae parallels that reported for Aedes aegypti larvae. The deduced\ncolocalization of the two ATPases along with NHA and NAT in the alimentary\ncanal constitutes a cationic pathway for Na+-conserving midgut\nalkalinization and de-alkalinization which has never been reported before."},{"title":"High-speed gallop locomotion in the Thoroughbred racehorse.

Certain flight\ncharacteristics of the swift differ from those of previously studied species.\nAs the flight speed increases, the angular velocity of the wingbeat remains\nconstant, and so as the wingbeat amplitude increases, the frequency decreases\naccordingly, as though the flight muscles were contracting at a fixed rate.\nThe wings are also comparatively inflexible and are flexed or retracted rather\nlittle during the upstroke. The upstroke is always aerodynamically active and\nthis is reflected in the wake, where shedding of spanwise vorticity occurs\nthroughout the wingbeat. Although the wake superficially resembles those of\nother birds in cruising flight, with a pair of trailing wingtip vortices\nconnected by spanwise vortices, the continuous shedding of first positive\nvorticity during the downstroke and then negative vorticity during the\nupstroke suggests a wing whose circulation is gradually increasing and then\ndecreasing during the wingbeat cycle.

The main frequency component of non-flight\nvibrations, during which the wings are usually folded over the abdomen, is\nhigher than that of thoracic vibrations that drive the wing movements for\nflight. So far, this has been concluded from an increase in natural frequency\nof the oscillating system in association with the wing adduction. In the\npresent study, we measured the thoracic oscillations in stingless bees during\nstationary flight and during two types of non-flight behaviour, annoyance\nbuzzing and forager communication, using laser vibrometry. As expected, the\nflight vibrations met all tested assumptions for resonant oscillations: slow\nbuild-up and decay of amplitude; increased frequency following reduction of\nthe inertial load; and decreased frequency following an increase of the mass\nof the oscillating system. Resonances, however, do not play a significant role\nin the generation of non-flight vibrations. The strong decrease in main\nfrequency at the end of the pulses indicates that these were driven at a\nfrequency higher than the natural frequency of the system. Despite significant\ndifferences regarding the main frequency components and their oscillation\namplitudes, the mechanism of generation is apparently similar in annoyance\nbuzzing and forager vibrations. Both types of non-flight vibration induced\noscillations of the wings and the legs in a similar way.

Here,\nstolon regression is identified and characterized as a potential process\nunderlying this variation. Typically, regression can be observed in a few\nstolons of a normally growing colony. For detailed studies, many stolons of a\ncolony can be induced to regress by pharmacological manipulations of reactive\noxygen species (e.g. hydrogen peroxide) or reactive nitrogen species (e.g.\nnitric oxide). The regression process begins with a cessation of\ngastrovascular flow to the distal part of the stolon. High levels of\nendogenous H2O2 and NO then accumulate in the regressing\nstolon.

The muscle remained in the ascending limb of its length-tension\nrelationship throughout the crawl cycle.

We parameterized the model by\nmeasuring the radius of the artificial masses, metabolic densities (=embryo\nmetabolic rate×embryo density) and oxygen diffusion coefficients at both\nambient (–1.5°C) or slightly warmer (+1.5–2°C)\ntemperatures.

The unpigmented cuticula of this spider is transparent. Both\nthe guanine localized in guanine cells in the opisthosoma and the uric acid\nlocalized in epidermis cells in the prosoma are responsible for the white\ncoloration. The bright yellow color is due to the combination of ommochrome\npigment granules and the white reflectance from coincident guanine and/or uric\nacid. The formation of ommochrome pigment granules in epidermis cells proceeds\nvia three distinctive steps. Translucent, UV fluorescent, progranules\n(type I) are produced by a dense network of endoplasmic reticulum\nassociated with numerous mitochondria and glycogen rosettes. These progranules\nare present in white spiders only, and regularly distributed in the cytoplasm.\nThe merging of several progranules of type I into a transient state\n(progranule type II) leads to the formation of granules (type\nIII) characterized by their lack of fluorescence, their spherical\nsections and their osmophilic-electron-dense contents.

To find out whether leech Retzius neurons\npossess swelling-activated Cl– channels that facilitate\nCl– efflux and, hence, volume recovery, we exposed the cells\nto hypotonic solutions. In hypotonic solutions, the cells slowly swelled but\ndid not undergo a regulatory volume decrease. However, the cell volume\nincreased less than predicted for an ideal osmometer, suggesting the action of\na compensatory mechanism. The cell swelling was paralleled by a marked\ndecrease in the input resistance as well as by the activation of a membrane\ncurrent with a reversal potential close to the Cl–\nequilibrium potential. This current was substantially diminished by removing\nbath Cl–, by applying the Cl– channel\nblocker DIDS, or by treating the cells with the tubulin polymerization\ninhibitor colchicine. Furthermore, in the presence of colchicine or\nvinblastine, the cell swelling was substantially increased.

This obstacle could be overcome by\nusing the recently detected, robust and highly fecund parthenogenetic marbled\ncrayfish as an experimental animal. Batch-mates of this clonal crayfish, which\nwere shown to be isogenic by analysis of nuclear microsatellite loci,\nexhibited surprisingly broad ranges of variation in coloration, growth,\nlife-span, reproduction, behaviour and number of sense organs, even when\nreared under identical conditions. Maximal variation was observed for the\nmarmorated coloration, the pattern of which was unique in each of the several\nhundred individuals examined. Variation among identically raised batch-mates\nwas also found with respect to fluctuating asymmetry, a traditional indicator\nof the epigenetic part of the phenotype, and global DNA methylation, an\noverall molecular marker of an animal's epigenetic state. Developmental\nvariation was produced in all life stages, probably by\nreaction–diffusion-like patterning mechanisms in early development and\nnon-linear, self-reinforcing circuitries involving behaviour and metabolism in\nlater stages. Our data indicate that, despite being raised in the same\nenvironment, individual genotypes can map to numerous phenotypes via\nDV, thus generating variability among clone-mates and individuality in a\nparthenogenetic species.

This\nstudy investigates the capacity of larvae to resist inoculative freezing and\nundergo cryoprotective dehydration at subzero temperatures. Slow cooling to–\n3°C in an environment at equilibrium with the vapor pressure of ice\nreduced larval water content by ∼40% and depressed the body fluid melting\npoint more than threefold to –2.6°C. This melting point depression\nwas the result of the concentration of existing solutes (i.e. loss of body\nwater) and the de novo synthesis of osmolytes. By day 14 of the\nsubzero exposure, larval survival was still >95%, suggesting larvae have\nthe capacity to undergo cryoprotective dehydration. However, under natural\nconditions the use of cryoprotective dehydration may be constrained by\ninoculative freezing as result of the insect's intimate contact with\nenvironmental ice. During slow cooling within a substrate of frozen soil, the\nability of larvae to resist inoculative freezing and undergo cryoprotective\ndehydration was dependent upon the moisture content of the soil. As detected\nby a reduction of larval water content, the percentage of larvae that resisted\ninoculative freezing increased with decreasing soil moisture.

Two specific\nflight muscles, the dorsal-ventral muscle (DVM, indirect muscle, a wing\nelevator) and the third axillary muscle (3AXM, direct muscle, a wing\nretractor), can modulate the flapping angle and the deviation angle,\nrespectively, by means of regulating the firing timing of muscle activities.\nThe firing timing can be expressed by the firing latency absolutely, which is\njust before the timing of ventral stroke reversal. The results illustrate that\nlengthening the firing latency of the DVM and of the 3AXM can increase the\nflapping angle and the deviation angle, respectively, which both strengthen\nthe downstroke at the ventral stroke reversal. The relationship of bilateral\nasymmetry shows that the bilateral differences in the firing latency of the\nDVM and of the 3AXM will cause bilateral differences in the wing position,\nwhich accompany the variations of yaw and roll angles in time course.

Larvae of two\ndifferent Astyanax cavefish populations and the con-specific sighted\nsurface-dwelling form (surface fish) respond similarly to light dimming by\nshading the pineal eye. As a response to shading, cavefish larvae swim upward\nvertically. This behavior resembles that of amphibian tadpoles rather than\nother teleost larvae, which react to shadows by swimming downward. The shadow\nresponse is highest at 1.5-days post-fertilization (d.p.f.), gradually\ndiminishes, and is virtually undetectable by 7.5 d.p.f. The shadow response\nwas substantially reduced after surgical removal of the pineal gland from\nsurface fish or cavefish larvae, indicating that it is based on pineal\nfunction. In contrast, removal of one or both bilateral eye primordia did not\naffect the shadow response. Consistent with its light detecting capacity,\nimmunocytochemical studies indicate that surface fish and cavefish pineal eyes\nexpress a rhodopsin-like antigen, which is undetectable in the degenerating\nbilateral eyes of cavefish larvae.

If this is true, little or no\nexternal work is done at the proximal joints during constant-speed running.\nThis possibility has important implications to the energetics of running and\nto the coupling of lung ventilation to the locomotor cycle. To test if the\nforelimb functions as an inverted strut at the shoulder during constant-speed\nrunning and to characterize the locomotor function of extrinsic muscles of the\nforelimb, we monitored changes in the recruitment of six muscles that span the\nshoulder (the m. pectoralis superficialis descendens, m. pectoralis profundus,\nm. latissimus dorsi, m. omotransversarius, m. cleidobrachialis and m.\ntrapezius) to controlled manipulations of locomotor forces and moments in\ntrotting dogs (Canis lupus familiaris Linnaeus 1753). Muscle activity\nwas monitored while the dogs trotted at moderate speed (approximately 2 m\ns–1) on a motorized treadmill. Locomotor forces were modified\nby (1) adding mass to the trunk, (2) inclining the treadmill so that the dogs\nran up- and downhill (3) adding mass to the wrists or (4) applying\nhorizontally directed force to the trunk through a leash. When the dogs\ntrotted at constant speed on a level treadmill, the primary protractor muscles\nof the forelimb exhibited activity during the last part of the ipsilateral\nsupport phase and the beginning of swing phase, a pattern that is consistent\nwith the initiation of swing phase but not with active protraction of the limb\nduring the beginning of support phase. Results of the force manipulations were\nalso consistent with the protractor muscles initiating swing phase and\ncontributing to active braking via production of a protractor moment\non the forelimb when the dogs decelerate. A similar situation appears to be\ntrue for the major retractor muscles of the forelimb. The m. pectoralis\nprofundus and the m. latissimus dorsi were completely silent during the\nsupport phase of the ipsilateral limb when the dogs ran unencumbered and\nexhibited little or no increase in activity when the dogs carried added mass\non their backs to increase any retraction torque during the support phase of\nconstant-speed running. The most likely explanation for these observations is\nthat the ground force reaction vector is oriented very close to the fulcrum of\nthe forelimb such that the forelimb functions as a compliant strut at the\nshoulder when dogs trot at constant speed on level surfaces. Because the\nmoments at the fulcrum of the pectoral girdle appear to be small during the\nsupport phase of a trotting step, a case can be made that it is the activity\nof the extrinsic appendicular muscles that produce the swing phase of the\nforelimb that explain the coupled phase relationship between ventilatory\nairflow and the locomotor cycle in trotting dogs."},{"title":"Returning on empty: extreme blood O2 depletion underlies dive\ncapacity of emperor penguins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/24/4279","abstract":"Blood gas analyses from emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) at\nrest, and intravascular PO2 profiles from\nfree-diving birds were obtained in order to examine hypoxemic tolerance and\nutilization of the blood O2 store during dives.

MHC155 abundance showed a\nstrong negative relationship to muscle power output in healthy dragonflies but\neither no relationship or a weakly positive relationship in infected\ndragonflies. Troponin T (TnT) protein isoform profiles were not significantly\ndifferent between healthy and infected dragonflies but whereas TnT isoform\nprofile was correlated with power output in healthy dragonflies, there was no\nsuch correlation in infected dragonflies. Multivariate analyses of power\noutput based on MHC155 abundance and a principal component of TnT protein\nisoform abundances explained 98% of the variation in muscle power output in\nhealthy dragonflies but only 29% when data from healthy and infected\ndragonflies were pooled. These results indicate that important, yet largely\nunexplored, functional relationships exist between (pathways regulating)\nmyofibrillar protein expression and (post-translational) protein processing.\nMoreover, infection by protozoan parasites of the midgut is associated with\nchanges in muscle protein composition (i.e. across body compartments) that,\neither alone or in combination with other unmeasured changes, alter muscle\ncontractile performance."},{"title":"Holdfast heroics: comparing the molecular and mechanical properties of\nMytilus californianus byssal threads","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/24/4307","abstract":"The marine mussel Mytilus californianus Conrad inhabits the most\nwave-exposed regions of the rocky intertidal by dint of its extraordinary\ntenacity.

In the present study we evaluate the\nsignificance of body friction for yaw turning and thus the limits of visually\nmediated flight control in Drosophila, by scoring tethered flies\nflying in a flight simulator on their ability to visually compensate a bias on\na moving object and a visual background panorama at different simulated\nfrictional dampings. We estimated the fly's natural damping coefficient from a\nnumerical aerodynamic model based on both friction on the body and the\nflapping wings during saccadic turning. The model predicts a coefficient of\n54×10–12 Nm s, which is more than 100-times larger than\nthe value estimated from a previous study on the body alone. Our estimate\nsuggests that friction plays a larger role for yaw turning in\nDrosophila than moments of inertia. The simulator experiments showed\nthat visual performance of the fruit fly collapses near the physical\nconditions estimated for freely flying animals, which is consistent with the\nsuggested role of the halteres for flight stabilization. However, kinematic\nanalyses indicate that the measured loss of flight control might be due\npredominantly to the limited fine control in the fly's steering muscles below\na threshold of 1–2° stroke amplitude, rather than resulting from the\nlimits of visual motion detection by the fly's compound eyes. We discuss the\nimpact of these results and suggest that the elevated frictional coefficient\npermits freely flying fruit flies to passively terminate rotational body\nmovements without producing counter-torque during the second half of the\nsaccadic turning manoeuvre."},{"title":"Energy availability influences microclimate selection of hibernating bats","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/24/4345","abstract":"Many species hibernate to conserve energy during periods of low food and\nwater availability.

Routine single-beat turns were\nselected from the recorded image sequences for kinematic and hydrodynamic\nanalysis. As with C-starts, the turns can be divided into two stages (stage 1\nand stage 2), based on kinematics. Stage 1 involves a bend to one side forming\na C-shaped curve in the body, while stage 2 corresponds to the return flip of\nthe body and tail. The turning angle in stage 1 accounts for the greatest\nportion of the total turning angle and the mean turning rate in stage 1\nreflects the intensity of turn. The effects of the turning rate in stage 1 on\nboth kinematics and hydrodynamics were examined. The duration of stage 1\nremained relatively stable over a nearly tenfold change in turning rate.\nConsequently, the turning angle is dominated by the turning rate in stage 1.\nThe turning radius is not related to the swimming speed. Moreover, except in\nvery fast turns, the turning radius is also not affected by the turning rate.\nThe angle between the side jet and the carp's initial orientation of a turn\ndoes not change substantially with the turning rate, and it is always close to\n90° (94.2±3.1°, N=41), so the orientation of the side\njet in the forthcoming turn can be predicted. The angle between the jet and\nthe line joining the center of mass of the carp and the trailing edge of the\ntail (mean value in stage 1) is also always close to 90°\n(95.3±1.3°, N=41). It is helpful for the carp to maximize\nthe torque so as to improve the turning efficiency. In stage 1, the impulsive\nmoment obtained from the beat of the body and tail and the mean angular\nmomentum of the carp show an agreement in magnitude. Two types of flow\npatterns in the wake of routine single-beat turns are revealed. The difference\nbetween the two types of wakes is in whether or not a vortex ring and a thrust\njet are generated in stage 2. The recoil speed of the tail, the bending\namplitude of the turn, and the angle of attack of the tail are three probable\nfactors influencing the flow patterns in stage 2."},{"title":"Strategies for regulation of hemolymph pH in acidic and alkaline water by\nthe larval mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.)

Signals varied markedly\nacross species and even between congeners and populations of the same species.\nChirps and EODs were particularly evolutionarily labile, whereas rises\ndiffered little across species. Although all chirp parameters contributed to\nspecies differences in these signals, chirp amplitude modulation, frequency\nmodulation (FM) and duration were particularly diverse. Within this diversity,\nhowever, interspecific correlations between chirp parameters suggest that\nmechanistic trade-offs may shape some aspects of signal evolution. In\nparticular, a consistent trade-off between FM and EOD amplitude during chirps\nis likely to have influenced the evolution of chirp structure. These patterns\nsuggest that functional or mechanistic linkages between signal parameters\n(e.g. the inability of electromotor neurons increase their firing rates\nwithout a loss of synchrony or amplitude of action potentials) constrain the\nevolution of signal structure."},{"title":"Chromatic organization of cone photoreceptors in the retina of rainbow trout: single cones irreversibly switch from UV (SWS1) to blue (SWS2) light sensitive opsin during natural development","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/23/4123","abstract":"The retinas of salmonid fishes have single and double cones arranged in\nsquare to row formations termed mosaics.

Previous research using coho salmon-derived riboprobes on four\nspecies of anadromous Pacific salmon has shown that all single cones express a\nSWS1 (UV sensitive) visual pigment protein (opsin) at hatching, and that these\ncones switch to a SWS2 (blue light sensitive) opsin during the juvenile\nperiod. Whether this opsin switch applies to non-anadromous species, like the\nrainbow trout, is under debate as species-specific riboprobes have not been\nused to study opsin expression during development of a trout. As well, a\npostulated recovery of SWS1 opsin expression in the retina of adult rainbow\ntrout, perhaps via a reverse process to that occurring in the\njuvenile, has not been investigated.

The aim of this study was to examine these\nmechanics in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae by measuring the flexural\nstiffness of individual neuromasts. Each neuromast possesses a gelatinous\ncupula that is anchored to hair cells by kinocilia. Using quasi-static bending\ntests of the proximal region of the cupula, we found that flexural stiffness\nis proportional to the number of hair cells, and consequently the number of\nkinocilia, within a neuromast. From this relationship, the flexural stiffness\nof an individual kinocilium was found to be 2.4×10–20 N\nm2. Using this value, we estimate that the 11 kinocilia in an\naverage cupula generate more than four-fifths of the total flexural stiffness\nin the proximal region. The relatively minor contribution of the cupular\nmatrix may be attributed to its highly compliant material composition (Young's\nmodulus of ∼21 Pa). The distal tip of the cupula is entirely composed of\nthis material and is consequently predicted to be at least an order of\nmagnitude more flexible than the proximal region.

Sergeant fish produce sounds at close distances to the intended\nreceiver (⩽1–2 body lengths), with different pulse characteristics\nthat are associated primarily with aggression, nest preparation and\ncourtship–female-visit behaviors. Energy peaks of all sounds were\nbetween 90 and 380 Hz, whereas courtship–visit sounds had a pulse\nrepetition rate of 125 Hz with harmonic intervals up to 1 kHz. AEP threshold,\nwhich is probably higher than the behavioral threshold, indicates best\nsensitivity at low frequencies (95–240 Hz), with the lowest threshold at\n125 Hz (123–127 dBrms re: 1 μPa). Thus, sound production\nand hearing in A. abdominalis are closely matched in the frequency\ndomain and are useful for courtship and mating at close distances.

At present, it is unclear how lymphatic\nfluid that accumulates in central body subcutaneous lymph sacs is moved to the\nanterior and posterior lymph hearts in the axillary regions and how lymph is\nmoved, against gravity, to the dorsally located lymph hearts. In this study,\nwe tested the hypothesis that lung ventilation, through its consequent effects\non lymph sac pressure, contributes to the vertical movement of lymphatic fluid\nin the cane toad (Chaunus marinus) and the North American bullfrog\n(Lithobates catesbeiana). We measured pressure in the dorsal, lateral\nand subvertebral lymph sacs of anesthetized cane toads and bullfrogs during\nartificial lung inflation and deflation. We also measured pressure in the\nsubvertebral lymph sac, which adheres to the dorsal surface of the lungs,\nsimultaneously with brachial (forelimb) and pubic (posterior) sac pressure\nduring ventilation in freely behaving animals. There were highly significant\n(P<0.001) relationships between lung pressure and lymph sac\npressures (r2=0.19–0.72), indicating that pulmonary\npressure is transmitted to the highly compliant lymph sacs that surround the\nlungs.

For marine\ninvertebrates, which utilise the ancestral strategy of broadcast spawning eggs\nand sperm, however, it appears that males tend to release their sperm more\nslowly than females release their eggs. Marine invertebrate eggs typically\nhave a relatively slow permanent block to polyspermy (whereby eggs become\nimpermeable to further sperm attachment), and for several minutes after\nfertilisation, sperm can continue to attach to a fertilised egg. We\nhypothesised that releasing sperm slowly minimises the `wastage' of sperm on\nalready fertilised eggs. We simulated different sperm release rates in a flume\nusing the broadcast spawning polychaete, Galeolaria caespitosa. Sperm\nrelease rates strongly affected overall fertilisation success: higher release\nrates resulted in lower fertilisation rates. Laboratory studies confirmed that\nthe `permanent' block to polyspermy in G. caespitosa took less than a\nminute to form but this lag was sufficient to result in some sperm wastage.\nThus upstream, fertilised eggs that have not formed a permanent block to\npolyspermy can remove sperm from the pool that would otherwise fertilise\ndownstream sibling eggs. We suggest that while electrical blocks to polyspermy\nevolved in response to excess sperm, permanent blocks to polyspermy could have\nevolved in response to sperm limitation (insufficient sperm)."},{"title":"Drosophila flies combine periodic heartbeat reversal with a\ncirculation in the anterior body mediated by a newly discovered anterior pair\nof ostial valves and `venous' channels","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/21/3707","abstract":"Heartbeat activity in tethered adult drosophilids was recorded using a\nlinear optosensor chip and an IR-light beam.

Pectoralis muscle length change and activity patterns were\nrecorded in budgerigars Melopsitaccus undulatus and zebra finches\nTaeniopygia guttata at a range of flight speeds using sonomicrometry\nand electromyography (EMG). The pectoralis muscles in these species contain a\nsingle muscle fibre type.

Relative EMG intensity, wingbeat frequency and muscle strain varied\nin an approximately U-shaped relationship with flight speed. The shape of the\nlength trajectory varied with flight speed in budgerigars, with the proportion\nof the cycle spent shortening being lowest at intermediate flight speeds.

A comparison of the\ndiurnal and nocturnal hunting performances of spiders showed that their\nconspicuous coloration had a higher luring effect under dim light conditions.\nThese results demonstrate that the conspicuous body coloration of N.\npilipes functions as a visual lure to attract both diurnal and\nnocturnal prey.

When\nperches were inclined at either 45° or 90°, snakes were unable to move\nuphill or downhill on the larger diameters. None of the locomotion on perches\nconformed to any previously described mode of limbless locomotion. On\nhorizontal and uphill perches snakes performed a variant of concertina\nlocomotion with periodic stopping and gripping.

Firstly, this\nstudy shows that the use of the slope of the regression between the rate of\nenergy expenditure and speed to calculate the net energy cost of locomotion\noverestimates the net cost of human running. Also, the net energy cost of\nhuman running is only 17% higher than that predicted based on their mass.

Here we show that ANCE, which shares many enzymatic properties\nwith mammalian ACE, is also a product of the male accessory gland of D.\nmelanogaster. It is expressed in the secondary cells and is associated\nwith the electron dense granule within the large vesicles of these cells.

Our data\nshow that conspecific echolocation calls clearly improved the bats'\nperformance in finding tree holes, both from flying (long-range detection) and\nwhen they were crawling on the trunk (short range detection). The other cues\nwe presented had no, or only weak, effects on performance, implying that\ndetection of new cavities from a distance is difficult for noctules if no\nadditional social cues, in particular calls from conspecifics, are present.

Bluegill were offered ghost shrimp tethered to a\nload cell that recorded force at 5000 Hz, and feeding sequences were\nsynchronously recorded using 500 Hz video. Peak forces exerted on attached 20\nmm shrimp ranged from 0.005 N to 0.506 N. In accordance with the short\nduration of the strikes (average time to peak gape of ∼13 ms), the forces\nrecorded were brief (∼12 ms from initiation to peak force), and force\nmagnitude declined rapidly after peak force. Statistical analysis indicated\nthat rate of buccal expansion, and prey size, but not strike initiation\ndistance, significantly affected peak force. These observed variables were\nused with results from flow visualization studies to estimate the flow at the\nprey's location, which allowed the calculation of drag, pressure gradient\nforce and acceleration reaction force. The relationship between these\ncalculated forces and the measured forces was strong, indicating that the\nmodel can be used to estimate forces from strike kinematics. This model was\nthen used to study the effects of strike initiation distance on peak force and\non the rate of increasing force. Comparisons of model output to empirical\nresults indicated that bluegill time their strike so as to exert an average of∼\n70% of the peak possible force on the prey, and that the observed strike\ninitiation distance corresponded to the distance that maximized modeled force\non an attached prey. Our results highlight the ability of bluegill to produce\nhigh forces on their prey, and indicate that precision and visual acuity play\nimportant roles in prey acquisition, beyond their recognized role in prey\ndetection."},{"title":"Orientation towards prey in antlions: efficient use of wave propagation in sand","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/19/3337","abstract":"Substrate-borne vibration for locating mates, predators and prey is\nwidespread in the animal kingdown.

Thirty four\nhealthy human adults were tested while maintaining a constant average walking\nvelocity in the five gait conditions. Ground reaction force and sagittal plane\nkinematic data were obtained during the stance phases of these gaits and used\nin inverse dynamic analyses to calculate joint torques and powers at the hip,\nknee and ankle. Muscle work was derived as the area under the joint power\nvs time curves and was partitioned into positive, negative and net\ncomponents. Dependent t-tests were used to compare positive and\nnegative work in level walking and net joint work between ascent and descent\ngaits on the ramp and stairs (P<0.010). Total negative and\npositive work in level walking was –34 J and 50 J, respectively, with\nthe difference in magnitude being statistically significant\n(P<0.001). Level walking was therefore performed with 16 J of net\npositive muscle work per step. The magnitude of the net work in ramp ascent\nwas 25% greater than the magnitude of net work in ramp descent (89 vs–\n71 J m–1, P<0.010). Similarly, the\nmagnitude of the net work in stair ascent was 43% greater than the magnitude\nof net work in stair descent (107 vs –75 J\nstep–1, P<0.000). We identified three potential\ncauses for the reduced negative vs positive work in these locomotion\ntasks: (1) the larger magnitude of the accelerations induced by the larger\nground reaction forces in descending compared to ascending gaits elicited\ngreater energy dissipation in non-muscular tissues, (2) the ground reaction\nforce vector was directed closer to the joint centers in ramp and stair\ndescent compared to ascent, which reduced the load on the muscular tissues and\ntheir energy dissipating response, and (3) despite the need to produce\nnegative muscle work in descending gaits, both ramp and stair descent also had\npositive muscle work to propel the lower extremity upward and forward into the\nswing phase movement trajectory. We used these data to formulate two novel\nhypotheses about human locomotion. First, level walking requires muscles to\ngenerate a net positive amount of work per gait cycle to overcome energy\nlosses by other tissues. Second, skeletal muscles generate more mechanical\nenergy in gait tasks that raise the center of mass compared to the mechanical\nenergy they dissipate in gait tasks that lower the center of mass, despite\nequivalent changes in total mechanical energy."},{"title":"The ontogeny of fin function during routine turns in zebrafish Danio\nrerio","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/19/3374","abstract":"Zebrafish Danio rerio exhibit spontaneous, routine turns as part\nof their normal foraging behavior from the early free-swimming stage to\nadulthood.

Conversely, the ontogeny of turning\nperformance should reflect morphological development. In this paper we analyze\nthe kinematics of routine turning during ontogeny in zebrafish and compare the\nscaling of turning kinematics to predictions from two existing models.\nTwenty-nine fish ranging in size from 0.38 to 1.97 cm in fork length\n(FL) were filmed at 1000 frames s–1 while performing\nroutine turns.

Other variables show a constant\npositive (pectoral and caudal fin velocity, turn duration), negative (body\ncurvature) or zero (head velocity) rate of change across ontogeny. We\ninterpret these trends in light of morphological changes over ontogeny as well\nas relevant hydrodynamic conditions.

In the present study, we describe a musculotendon\nmorphology that serves to counteract the variation in moment arm and fiber\nstrains that are inherent in broad muscles. The tendon of the anterior jaw\nadductor of the spotted ratfish Hydrolagus colliei is twisted such\nthat the distal face of the muscle inserts more proximally than the proximal\nface.

Manipulations of\nthis geometric model show that the natural morphology is `ideal' compared to\nother hypothetical morphologies for limiting fiber strain heterogeneity.

Optimal foraging models suggest that\ntransit swim speed should decrease to minimum cost of transport (MCT) speed in\ndeeper and longer duration dives. Observations also suggest that descent and\nascent swimming mode and speed may vary in response to changes in buoyancy. We\nmeasured the swimming behaviour during simulated foraging of seven captive\nfemale grey seals (two adults and five pups). Seals had to swim horizontally\nunderwater from a breathing box to a submerged automatic feeder. The distance\nto the feeder and the rate of prey food delivery could be varied to simulate\ndifferent feeding conditions.Diving durations and distances travelled in dives recorded during these\nexperiments were similar to those recorded in the wild. Mean swim speed\ndecreased significantly with increasing distance to the patch, indicating that\nseals adjusted their speed in response to travel distance, consistent with\noptimality model predictions. There was, however, no significant relationship\nbetween the transit swim speeds and prey density at the patch.

SP evoked a\nsignificant elevation of fV, a concomitant depression of\nVAMP, and a resultant decrease in VTOT\nbut only at the highest dose (250 pmol). NKA was without action on\nfV but significantly decreased VAMP at\nonly the highest dose tested. In this case also, the net effect of NKA was to\nreduce VTOT.

This 3 mm long,\nflightless insect weighs up to 1.4 mg and can jump by rapid movements of the\nhind legs that accelerate the body in 1.5 ms to a take-off velocity of 1.5 m\ns–1.

In order to test which features of an object the fish\nuse under these conditions to discriminate between differently shaped objects,\nwe trained eight individuals in a food-rewarded, two-alternative,\nforced-choice procedure. All fish learned to discriminate between two objects\nof different shapes and volumes. When new object combinations were offered in\nnon-rewarded test trials, fish preferred those objects that resembled the one\nthey had been trained to (S+) and avoided objects resembling the one that had\nnot been rewarded (S–). For a decision, fish paid attention to the\nrelative differences between the two objects they had to discriminate. For\ndiscrimination, fish used several object features, the most important ones\nbeing volume, material and shape. The importance of shape was demonstrated by\nreducing the objects to their 3-dimensional contours, which sufficed for the\nfish to distinguish differently shaped objects. Our results also showed that\nfish attended strongly to the feature `volume', because all individuals tended\nto avoid the larger one of two objects. When confronted with metal\nversus plastic objects, all fish avoided metal and preferred plastic\nobjects, irrespective of training. In addition to volume, material and shape,\nfish attended to additional parameters, such as corners or rounded edges. When\nconfronted with two unknown objects, fish weighed up the positive and negative\nproperties of these novel objects and based their decision on the outcome of\nthis comparison. Our results suggest that fish are able to link and assemble\nlocal features of an electrolocation pattern to construct a representation of\nan object, suggesting that some form of a feature extraction mechanism enables\nthem to solve a complex object recognition task."},{"title":"Effects of mass and body composition on fasting fuel utilisation in grey\nseal pups (Halichoerus grypus Fabricius): an experimental study using\nsupplementary feeding","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/17/3043","abstract":"This study used supplementary feeding to test the hypothesis that fuel\npartitioning during the postweaning fast in grey seal pups is affected by size\nand composition of energy reserves at weaning, and by extra provisioning. Mass\nand body composition changes were measured during suckling and fasting to\ninvestigate the effect of natural differences in energy reserves at weaning on\nsubsequent allocation of fat and protein to energy use. We fed seven pups for\n5 days after weaning, to investigate the effect of increased fuel\navailability, and particularly protein, on fuel utilisation. After correcting\nfor protein used during the moult, the proportional contribution of fat was\n86–99% of total energy use. Pups with greater energy reserves, i.e.\nthose that were heavier and fatter at weaning, had higher rates of fat and\nenergy use. There was no significant relationship between adiposity at weaning\nand proportional contribution of fat to energy use, perhaps due to a limited\nsample size or range of body masses and adiposity. Supplemented individuals\nused energy, specifically fat, much faster and utilised proportionally less of\ntheir endogenous protein by departure than non-supplemented individuals. Fat\nmetabolism contributed a similar percentage to daily energy use in both\ngroups. These findings show that pups spare protein, even when energy use is\ndramatically increased. Pups that receive greater maternal provisioning and\nlay down more protein may have increased survival chances at sea.

The caterpillar of Manduca sexta is an exception\nto this general pattern. Despite eliciting a strong peripheral gustatory\nresponse, high concentrations of carbohydrates (e.g. glucose or inositol)\nstimulate the same intensity of biting as water during 2-min tests. We\nsuspected that the lack of feeding stimulation reflected the fact that prior\nstudies used single carbohydrates (e.g. sucrose), which M. sexta\nwould rarely encounter in its host plants. We hypothesized that the feeding\ncontrol system of M. sexta responds selectively to carbohydrate\nmixtures. To test this hypothesis, we ran three experiments. First, we\nstimulated the two taste sensilla that respond to carbohydrates (the lateral\nand medial styloconic) with a battery of carbohydrates. These sensilla\nresponded exclusively to sucrose, glucose and inositol. Second, we determined\nthe response properties of the carbohydrate-sensitive taste cells within both\nsensilla. We found that one class of carbohydrate-sensitive taste cell\nresponded to sucrose, and two other classes each responded to glucose and\ninositol. Third, we examined the initial biting responses of caterpillars to\ndisks treated with solutions containing single carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose\nor inositol) or binary mixtures of these carbohydrates. The only solutions\nthat stimulated sustained biting were those that activated all three classes\nof taste cell (i.e. sucrose+inositol or sucrose+glucose).

Contrary to previous\nassertions, the retractor muscle does not merely provide structural support\nfor the full pouch during locomotion.

Here, we directly tested\nthe hypothesis that an increase in turning activity, without the application\nof exercise per se, will alter femoral cross-sectional shape. Thirty\nday-old female BALB/cByJ mice (n=10 per group) were single-housed for\n8 weeks in custom-designed cages that either accentuated linear or turning\nlocomotion or allowed subjects to freely roam standard cages. Consistent with\na lack of difference in physical activity levels between groups, there were no\nsignificant differences in body mass, femoral length, midshaft cortical area,\nand individual measures of mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) bending\nrigidity. However, the ratio of ML to AP diaphyseal rigidity, an indicator of\ncross-sectional shape, was significantly greater (P<0.05) in\nturning subjects than in linear or control subjects. Considering that across\nall groups mice were genetically identical and had equivalent levels of bone\nquantity and physical activity, differences in femoral shape were attributed\nto qualitative differences in locomotor patterns (i.e. specific locomotor\nmodes).

In\nthis study we identified two conserved osmotic response element (ORE) motifs\nin the promoter region of the killifish D2 gene (FhDio2) and examined\ntheir possible role in the transcriptional regulation of FhDio2\nduring hypo-osmotic stress. As assessed by the electrophoretic mobility shift\nassay, results from in vivo and in vitro experiments\ndemonstrate that exposure to an abrupt hyposmotic challenge triggers in the\nliver of killifish a strong nuclear recruitment of a putative osmotic response\nelement binding protein (OREBP). This protein–DNA binding is\ntime-dependent, attains a maximum within 2–8 h after the osmotic stress,\nand is followed by a significant increase in D2 activity. Furthermore,\nprotein–DNA binding and the subsequent elevation in enzyme activity were\nblocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Thus, during hypo-osmotic\nstress, a putative OREBP kinase-activated pathway stimulates FhDio2\ntranscription and enzymatic activity. These data and the fact that D2 is the\nmajor enzyme providing local intracellular T3 suggest that TH plays\na direct role in osmoregulation in fish, possibly by participating in hepatic\nammonia metabolism.

This may be due to limitations in how total mechanical power has\nbeen computed, as well as a failure to account for the efficiency with which\nmuscular work is done. We investigated how mechanical power and efficiency\ndepend on stride rate in walking, with both quantities computed from the work\ndone by the hip, knee and ankle joint moments. Our hypotheses were that\nmechanical power and efficiency are both optimized at the preferred stride\nrate, which would explain why metabolic energy expenditure is minimized at\nthis rate. Contrary to our hypotheses, mechanical power curves exhibited\nplateaus that spanned stride rates lower than preferred (predicted optima:\n11–12% below preferred), while net mechanical efficiency exhibited a\nplateau that spanned stride rates higher than preferred (predicted optimum: 8%\nabove preferred). As expected, preferred stride rate (54.3 strides\nmin–1) was not different from the stride rate that minimized\nnet metabolic energy expenditure (predicted optimum: 0.2% above preferred).\nGiven that mechanical power and mechanical efficiency exhibited plateaus on\nopposite sides of the preferred stride rate, the preferred rate in walking\nlikely represents a compromise between these two factors.

However, the\nrespiratory control ratio (RCR) of mitochondria from the liver and external\noblique calling muscle increased with cold acclimation. The increase in RCR\nwith thermal acclimation was due to upregulation of state 3 respiration, and\nnot to a decrease in state 4 respiration. Males had higher activity of citrate\nsynthase, β-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase and cytochrome c\noxidase than females in the calling (external oblique) muscle, and males also\nshowed thermal acclimation of these enzymes while females did not.\nAdditionally, males had greater activity of metabolic enzymes in the principal\nmuscle (extensor carpi radialis) used during amplexus.

From\nthe model, the shear force, which was generated at the snout by the juvenile\nalligators, was 0.015 N. Shear force was calculated to scale with body length\nto the 4.24 power and with mass to the 1.31 power. When scaled up to a 3 m\nalligator, shear force was calculated at 138 N. The death roll appears to help\ncircumvent the feeding morphology of the alligator. Shear forces generated by\nthe spinning maneuver are predicted to increase disproportionately with\nalligator size, allowing dismemberment of large prey."},{"title":"The imaging properties and sensitivity of the facial pits of pitvipers as determined by optical and heat-transfer analysis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/16/2801","abstract":"It is commonly assumed that the facial pit of pitvipers forms relatively\nsharp images and can detect small differences in environmental surface\ntemperatures. We have visualized the temperature contrast images formed on the\nfacial pit membrane using a detailed optical and heat transfer analysis, which\nincludes heat transfer through the air in the pit chambers as well as\nvia thermal infrared radiation. We find the image on the membrane to\nbe poorly focused and of very low temperature contrast. Heat flow through the\nair in the pit chambers severely limits sensitivity, particularly for small\nanimals with small facial pit chambers. The aperture of the facial pit appears\nto be larger than is optimal for detecting small targets such as prey at 0.5\nm. Angular resolution (i.e. sharpness) and image strength and contrast vary\ncomplexly with the size of the pit opening. As a result, the patterns of\nnatural background temperatures obscure prey items and other environmental\nfeatures, creating false patterns. Consequently, snakes cannot simply target\nthe strongest signal to strike prey. To account for observed behavioral\ncapabilities, the sensory endings on the pit membrane apparently must respond\nto temperature contrasts of 0.001°C or less. While neural image sharpening\nlikely enhances imaging performance, it appears important for foraging snakes\nto select ambush sites offering uniform backgrounds and strong thermal\ncontrasts. As the ancestral facial pit was likely less sensitive than the\ncurrent organ, objects with strong thermal signals, such as habitat features,\nwere needed to drive the evolution of this remarkable sense."},{"title":"Behavioral evidence for within-eyelet resolution in twisted-winged insects (Strepsiptera)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/16/2819","abstract":"Compound eyes are typically composed of hundreds to thousands of ommatidia,\neach containing 8–10 receptors.

Males of the insect order Strepsiptera are different: their eyes are\ncomposed of a smaller number of relatively large units (eyelets), each with an\nextended retina. Building on a study of Xenos vesparum, we use a\nbehavioral paradigm based on the optomotor response to investigate the\npossibility that the eyelets of the Strepsiptera Xenos peckii are\nimage-forming units. From anatomical evidence, we hypothesize that spatial\nsampling in the strepsipteran eye is determined not only by the interactions\nof widely spaced photoreceptors in different eyelets, but also by the angular\nseparation between groups of closely spaced photoreceptors within eyelets. We\ncompared X. peckii's optomotor response with the predictions of an\nelementary motion detector (EMD) model consisting of two distinctly different\nsampling bases. The best match between our empirical results and the model\nshows that the optomotor response in X. peckii males is determined by\nboth the small (intra-eyelet) and large (possibly inter-eyelet) separations.\nOur results indicate that the X. peckii eye has sampling bases around\n10° and 20°, and that each eyelet could be composed of up to 13\nsampling points, which is consistent with previous anatomical findings.

We manipulated CORT concentrations and\nresources in pre-reproductive and reproductive female tree lizards\n(Urosaurus ornatus) to test the hypothesis that CORT regulates the\ndistribution of limiting resources between the reproductive and immune\nsystems. To manipulate circulating concentrations of CORT we utilized a novel\nmethod of hormone implantation, in which a polymeric compound is mixed with\nhormone and injected in liquid form into the animal.

Venous PO2\nvalues were indistinguishable from arterial values after the first minute of\napnea; the lowest venous PO2 recorded was 15 mmHg after a\n7.8 min apnea.

Extreme hypoxemic\ntolerance in these seals was demonstrated by arterial PO2\nvalues during late apnea that were less than human thresholds for\nshallow-water blackout. Despite such low PO2s, there was\nno evidence of significant anaerobic metabolism, as changes in blood pH were\nminimal and attributable to increased PCO2. These findings\nand the previously reported lack of lactate accumulation during these\nbreath-holds are consistent with the maintenance of aerobic metabolism even at\nlow oxygen tensions during rest-associated apneas. Such hypoxemic tolerance is\nnecessary in order to allow dissociation of O2 from hemoglobin and\nprovide effective utilization of the blood O2 store."},{"title":"Mechanics of a `simple' ear: tympanal vibrations in noctuid moths","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/15/2637","abstract":"Anatomically, the ears of moths are considered to be among the simplest\nears found in animals.

We demonstrate that embryonic movement is\nsignificantly increased in the chicks raised at 38.5°C both during the\nperiod in which they are at the higher temperature but also 4 days after their\nreturn to the control temperature.

This is likely to promote greater\nleg muscle growth later in development, which may provide postural stability\nto the chicks posthatch. These changes are similar to those seen when drugs\nare injected to increase embryonic activity.

Manatees swam at velocities of 0.06–1.14 m\ns–1. Locomotion was accomplished by undulation of the body\nand caudal fluke. Undulatory locomotion is a rapid and relatively high-powered\npropulsive mode involved in cruising and migrating by a variety of swimmers.\nManatees displayed an undulatory swimming mode by passing a dorso-ventrally\noriented traveling wave posteriorly along the body. The propulsive wave\ntraveled at a higher velocity than the forward velocity of the animal. The\nfrequency of the propulsive cycle (f) increased linearly with\nincreasing swimming velocity (U). Amplitude at the tip of the caudal\nfluke (A) remained constant with respect to U and was 22% of\nbody length.

The muscles\nstudied were the iliotibialis lateralis pars postacetabularis (ILPO), a\nbiarticular knee and hip extensor, and the femorotibialis lateralis (FT), a\nknee extensor. Muscle length changes were recorded using sonomicrometry, and\nEMG activity was recorded from indwelling bipolar electrodes as the animals\nwalked and ran at a range of speeds (1–3.5 m s–1).\nTreadmill slope was also varied, from a 12° uphill slope to a downhill\nslope of –12°. To test the hypothesis that the strain pattern in\nactive muscles reflects the demand for mechanical work, we compared strain in\nthe ILPO and FT across the range of slopes. Both muscles underwent active\nlengthen–shorten cycles during stance. We analyzed the lengthening and\nshortening part of the strain pattern separately to determine the response of\nmuscle strain to surface slope. In both muscles stance phase shortening strain\nincreased over the range of slopes studied, from 7.8±3.5% (ILPO) and\n1.9±2.2% (FT) during downhill running at –12°, to\n30.3±3.9% (ILPO) and 8.2±5.6% (FT) during uphill running at\n12°.

The results\nsuggest that for the ILPO and FT a change in net mechanical work output with\nrunning slope is likely mediated by a change in both the lengthening, energy\nabsorbing portion of the contraction and the shortening, energy producing part\nof the contraction. We also found changes in the timing of EMG activity, and\nthe relative portion of the stance period spent lengthening, which were\nconsistent with a shift in muscle function from energy absorption during\ndownhill running, to net energy production during uphill running.Generally, muscle strain was less affected by speed than by slope.\nShortening strains were not significantly correlated with running speed. Only\nFT lengthening strain changed significantly with speed, ranging from–\n6.8±4.3% at 1 m s–1 to –15.3±4.7%\nat 3.5 m s–1.The consistent patterns of strain changes with running slope are evidence\nthat strain pattern is modulated to meet the changes in demand for net\nmechanical work. The relatively poor relationship between strain and running\nspeed may reflect the fact that changes in running speed during level running\nare not associated with a change in demand for net mechanical work. Taken\ntogether, the speed and slope results suggest that the demand for mechanical\nwork is an important determinant of muscle length patterns in running and\nwalking."},{"title":"Seasonal control of particle clearance by isolated gills from the clam\nMercenaria mercenaria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/14/2518","abstract":"Pieces of gill isolated from the clam Mercenaria mercenaria clear\ncolloidal graphite from seawater, and the clearance rates are measurable.\n5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) had a biphasic effect on clearance rates:\nconcentrations from 10–6 to 10–5 mol\nl–1 5-HT increased clearance, but higher concentrations\nreduced it.

The adhesion of threads to these surfaces differed\nby as much as 3.5-fold within a spider species and 2.1-fold for the same\ninsect surface between spider species.

Hearing sensitivities were measured under quiet lab conditions and\nin the presence of these masking noises at levels encountered in the field,\nusing the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) recording technique. The Lusitanian\ntoadfish is a hearing generalist, with best hearing sensitivity at low\nfrequencies between 50 and 200 Hz (below 100 dB re. 1 μPa). Under ambient\nnoise conditions, hearing was only slightly masked at lower frequencies. In\nthe presence of ship noise, auditory thresholds increased considerably, by up\nto 36 dB, at most frequencies tested. This is mainly because the main energies\nof ferry-boat noise were within the most sensitive hearing range of this\nspecies. Comparisons between masked audiograms and sound spectra of the\ntoadfish's mating and agonistic vocalizations revealed that ship noise\ndecreased the ability to detect conspecific acoustic signals.

By contrast, when the food sites\nwere further apart, initial headings switched abruptly between the two sites–\n ants either headed for food site 1 or for food site 2.

Atomic absorption spectrometry\nshowed that glue from the slug Arion subfuscus contains substantial\nquantities of zinc (46±7 p.p.m. and 189±80 p.p.m. in two\ndifferent sets of experiments) and also iron, copper and manganese (2–7\np.p.m.). Iron-specific staining demonstrates that iron is bound specifically\nto the 15 kDa glue protein. Several approaches were used to show that these\nmetals have important functional effects. Adding iron or copper to dissolved\nglue causes the proteins to precipitate rapidly, although zinc has no effect.\nRemoving iron and related transition metals with a chelator during secretion\nof the glue causes a sixfold increase in the solubility of the glue. Once the\nglue has set, however, removing these metals has no effect. Finally, the\ngel-stiffening activity of the glue proteins was measured in the presence and\nabsence of the chelator. The chelator eliminated the gel-stiffening effect of\nthe proteins, suggesting that transition metals were necessary for the\nproteins to act on the gel. Thus, the glue contains transition metals and\nthese metals play an essential role in glue function."},{"title":"Morphological diversity of medusan lineages constrained by animal–fluid interactions","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/11/1868","abstract":"Cnidarian medusae, commonly known as jellyfish, represent the earliest\nknown animal taxa to achieve locomotion using muscle power.

This study examines the\ncontributions of olfaction, mechanoreception and vision to odor source\nlocalization in a shark, the smooth dogfish Mustelus canis. Two\nparallel, turbulent plumes were created in an 8 m flume: squid rinse odor and\nseawater control. Minimally turbulent `oozing' sources of odor and seawater\ncontrol were physically separated from sources of major turbulence by placing\na brick downstream from each oozing source, creating two turbulent wakes, one\nor the other flavored with food odor. This created four separate targets for\nthe sharks to locate. Animals were tested under two light conditions\n(fluorescent and infrared) and in two sensory conditions (lateral line intact\nand lateral line lesioned by streptomycin). Intact animals demonstrated a\npreference for the odor plume over the seawater plume and for the source of\nodor/turbulence (the brick on the odor side) over the source of the odor alone\n(the odor-oozing nozzle). Plume and target preference and search time were not\nsignificantly affected by light condition. In the light, lesioning the lateral\nline increased search time but did not affect success rate or plume\npreference.

An in-depth historical research helped identify the skates\ndisplaying significantly different features from previous models and that\ncould consequently determine a better performance in terms of speed and energy\ndemand. Five pairs of ice skates were tested, from the bone-skates, dated\nabout 1800 BC, to modern ones.This paper provides evidence for the fact that the metabolic cost of\nlocomotion on ice decreased dramatically through history, the metabolic cost\nof modern ice-skating being only 25% of that associated with the use of\nbone-skates. Moreover, for the same metabolic power, nowadays skaters can\nachieve speeds four times higher than their ancestors could. In the range of\nspeeds considered, the cost of travelling on ice was speed independent for\neach skate model, as for running. This latter finding, combined with the\naccepted relationship between time of exhaustion and the sustainable fraction\nof metabolic power, gives the opportunity to estimate the maximum skating\nspeed according to the distance travelled.Ice skates were probably the first human powered locomotion tools to take\nthe maximum advantage from the biomechanical properties of the muscular\nsystem: even when travelling at relatively high speeds, the skating movement\npattern required muscles to shorten slowly so that they could also develop a\nconsiderable amount of force."},{"title":"Molecular characterization of an epithelial Ca2+ channel-like\ngene from crayfish Procambarus clarkii","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/10/1813","abstract":"This study describes the cloning, sequencing and functional\ncharacterization of an epithelial Ca2+ channel (ECaC)-like gene\nisolated from antennal gland (kidney) of the freshwater crayfish\nProcambarus clarkii.

Increasing temperature led to an upward shift of the\ncharacteristic hearing frequency, to an increase in sensitivity and to a\ndecrease in the latency of the auditory response both in the auditory nerve\nrecordings (periphery) and in some interneurons at the\nmetathoracic–abdominal ganglionic complex (MAC).

Keegan's in vitro tests for glucose transport against a\nconcentration gradient and with phloridzin inhibition in fruit bat intestine\nwere all negative, although he used several different tissue preparations and\nhad positive control results with laboratory rats. Because glucose absorption\nby fruit bats is nonetheless efficient, Keegan postulated that the rapid\nglucose absorption from the fruit bat intestine is not through the\nenterocytes, but must occur via spaces between the cells. Thus, we\nhypothesized that absorption of water-soluble compounds that are not actively\ntransported would be extensive in these bats, and would decline with\nincreasing molecular mass in accord with sieve-like paracellular absorption.\nWe did not presume from Keegan's studies that there is no\nNa+-coupled, mediated sugar transport in these bats, and our study\nwas not designed to rule it out, but rather to quantify the level of possible\nnon-mediated absorption. Using a standard pharmacokinetic technique, we fed,\nor injected intraperitonealy, the metabolically inert carbohydrates\nl-rhamnose (molecular mass=164 Da) and cellobiose (molecular\nmass=342 Da), which are absorbed by paracellular uptake, and\n3-O-methyl-d-glucose (3OMd-glucose), a\nd-glucose analog that is absorbed via both mediated\n(active) and paracellular uptake.

All three age classes of\nbirds, including baby birds with partially emerged, symmetrical wing feathers,\ngenerated circulation with their wings and exhibited a wake structure that\nconsisted of discrete vortex rings shed once per downstroke.

Although they are cannibals,\nadult newts feed preferentially on worms (Eisenia rosea) over\nconspecific young. Hence, larval avoidance reactions to TTX are suppressed in\nthe presence of odor from these alternative prey. The free amino acid,\narginine, is abundant in fluids emitted by injured worms. Here, we demonstrate\nthat arginine is a natural suppressant of TTX-stimulated larval escape\nbehavior. Compared to a tapwater control, larvae initiated vigorous swimming\nin response to 10–7 mol l–1 TTX. This\nexcitatory response was eliminated when larval nasal cavities were blocked\nwith an inert gel, but not when gel was placed on the forehead (control). In\nadditional trials, a binary mixture of arginine and 10–7 mol\nl–1 TTX failed to induce larval swimming. The inhibitory\neffect of arginine was, however, dose dependent. An arginine concentration as\nlow as 0.3-times that of TTX was significantly suppressant. Further analysis\nshowed that suppression by arginine of TTX-stimulated behavior was eliminated\nby altering the positively-charged guanidinium moiety, but not by modifying\nthe carbon chain, carboxyl group, or amine group.

Arginine was the\nstrongest attractant tested, with a response threshold (median effective dose)\nof 8.3×10–7 mol l–1 (uncorrected for\ndilution associated with chemical release and delivery). In contrast to adult\nbehavior, arginine suppressed cannibal-avoidance and failed to evoke search\nreactions in larvae.

Since elephant fish have also attracted attention from a\nviewpoint of genome science, the availability of fish for physiological\nstudies will make this species an excellent model in holocephalan fish\ngroup."},{"title":"Osmoregulation, ionoregulation and acid–base regulation by the\ngastrointestinal tract after feeding in the elasmobranch (Squalus\nacanthias)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/8/1335","abstract":"In order to study the physiological consequences of voluntary feeding in\nthe gastrointestinal tract of a ureotelic marine elasmobranch, dogfish (fasted\nfor 96 h) were sampled at various times up to 360 h after consuming a\n5–6% ration of teleost fish (hake) under natural feeding conditions.\nDigestion and absorption were completed between 120 and 360 h post-feeding.\nThe tissue masses of different segments of the gastrointestinal tract\nincreased and decreased markedly as the chyme moved through, mainly because of\nfluid engorgement rather than hyperplasia.

The 17 tested bio-inspired kinematic patterns were identical\nin stroke amplitude, stroke frequency and angle of attack with respect to the\nhorizontal stroke plane but varied in heaving motion. Clap-and-fling induced\nvertical force augmentation significantly decreased with increasing vertical\nforce production averaged over the entire stroke cycle, whereas total force\naugmentation was independent from changes in force produced by a single wing.\nVertical force augmentation was also largely independent of forces produced\ndue to wing rotation at the stroke reversals, the sum of rotational\ncirculation and wake capture force. We obtained maximum (17.4%) and minimum\n(1.4%) vertical force augmentation in two types of figure-eight stroke\nkinematics whereby rate and direction of heaving motion during fling may\nexplain 58% of the variance in vertical force augmentation. This finding\nsuggests that vertical wing motion distinctly alters the flow regime at the\nbeginning of the downstroke. Using an analytical model, we determined pitching\nmoments acting on an imaginary body of the flapping device from the measured\ntime course of forces, the changes in length of the force vector's moment arm,\nthe position of the centre of mass and body angle. The data show that pitching\nmoments are largely independent from mean vertical force; however,\nclap-and-fling reinforces mean pitching moments by approximately 21%, compared\nto the moments produced by a single flapping wing. Pitching moments due to\nclap-and-fling significantly increase with increasing vertical force\naugmentation and produce nose-down moments in most of the tested patterns. The\nanalytical model, however, shows that algebraic sign and magnitude of these\nmoments may vary distinctly depending on both body angle and the distance\nbetween the wing hinge and the animal's centre of mass. Altogether, the data\nsuggest that the benefit of clap-and-fling wing beat for vertical force\nenhancement and pitch balance may change with changing heaving motion and thus\nwing tip trajectory during manoeuvring flight. We hypothesize that these\ndependencies may have shaped the evolution of wing kinematics in insects that\nare limited by aerodynamic lift rather than by mechanical power of their\nflight musculature."},{"title":"Pregnancy block by MHC class I peptides is mediated via the\nproduction of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the mouse vomeronasal\norgan","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/8/1406","abstract":"The vomeronasal organ (VNO) has evolved to link an animal's behavior to its\nenvironment in a highly species-specific fashion.

Fourteen\ncaptive geese were weighed at 1–2-week intervals for two complete years.\nDuring the flightless period of the moult, body mass decreased by\napproximately 25% from the pre-moult value. To understand the basis of this\nchange, the rate of oxygen consumption was measured during daytime and\nnighttime at six points in the second year, and at three points (before,\nduring and after wing moult) behavioural observations were made. Measurements\nof the rate of oxygen consumption showed an 80% increase above that of the\nnonmoulting periods of the year. We propose that metabolism was increased\nduring moult because of the cost of feather synthesis. Although food was\navailable, the captive birds chose not to forage and instead increased the\nproportion of time spent resting. It is likely that this behaviour in response\nto wing moult is a strategy to avoid predation in the wild. Thus, the innate\nnature of this behaviour has potential survival value for wild birds of this\nspecies.

Several studies\non this and other flower-visiting insects have shown how olfactory and visual\nstimulation play (or do not play) a role in attraction and feeding.\nNevertheless, these studies have consistently manipulated stimuli in a\n`presence–absence' manner. Here, we experimentally decoupled the\npresentation of both stimuli spatially and temporally in a wind tunnel, rather\nthan entirely eliminating either one, and found that the decision-making\nprocess based on these stimuli is more flexible and complex than previously\nasserted. Manduca sexta was most responsive when both cues were\npresent and emanated from the same source. When stimuli were spatially\nseparated, responsiveness levels were comparable to those elicited by a single\nstimulus. However, transient olfactory stimulation either before or after\nvisually guided approach (temporal decoupling) enhanced responsiveness to an\nodorless visual target. Additionally, searching times were increased by either\na transient olfactory stimulation before take-off or by having the flower\nmodel spatially separated from the odor source tracked by the moths. Finally,\nin a dual-choice experiment, moths showed a strong bias for the visual display\nover the odor plume, suggesting the former to be the ultimate indicator of a\nnectar source. Our manipulation of floral cues shows that the feeding behavior\nof M. sexta, and probably of other nectivorous insects, is based not\nonly on the sensory stimulation per se but also on the temporal and\nspatial pattern in which these stimuli are perceived."},{"title":"Take-off and landing forces and the evolution of controlled gliding in\nnorthern flying squirrels Glaucomys sabrinus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/8/1413","abstract":"Flying squirrels are well known for their ability to glide between trees at\nthe top of a forest canopy. We present experimental performance and\nbehavioural evidence that flight in flying squirrels may have evolved out of a\nneed to control landing forces. Northern flying squirrels were filmed jumping\nfrom a horizontal branch to a much larger vertical pole. These were both\nslightly compliant (less than 1.9 mm N–1), and instrumented\nusing strain gauges so that forces could be measured. Take-off and landing\nforces were both positively correlated with horizontal range between 0.5 and\n2.5 m (r=0.355 and r=0.811, respectively,\nP<0.05), but not significantly different to each other at each\nrange tested. Take-off forces ranged from 1 to 10 bodyweights, and landing\nforces were between 3 and 10 bodyweights. Glide angles increased rapidly with\nhorizontal range, approaching 45° at 3 m, above which they gradually\ndecreased, suggesting that northern flying squirrels are optimised for long\ndistance travel. We show that northern flying squirrels initiate full gliding\nposture at ranges of less than 1 m, without landing any higher than an\nequivalent ballistic projectile. However, this gliding posture enables them to\npitch upwards, potentially stalling the wing, and spreads the landing reaction\nforce over all four extended limbs. At steeper approach angles of close to\n45°, flying squirrels were unable to pitch up sufficiently and landed\nforelimbs first, consequently sustaining higher impact forces. We investigate\nfour hypotheses to explain the origin of flight in these animals and conclude\nthat the need to reduce landing impact forces was most likely to have\nstimulated the development of aerial control in flying squirrels."},{"title":"What comes first, the zebra finch or the egg: temperature-dependent reproductive, physiological and behavioural plasticity in egg-laying zebra finches","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/8/1325","abstract":"Avian reproduction is generally timed to synchronize chick-rearing with\nperiods of increased food abundance.

We therefore examined the influence of low ambient temperature\n(7°C vs 21°C) on reproductive output (e.g. egg mass, clutch\nsize, laying interval, laying rate), daily food consumption and lipid\nvariables in zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata.

However, when producing eggs at 7°C,\nfemales took longer to initiate egg laying (6.5 vs 6.1 days at\n21°C), and ultimately laid fewer eggs (5.5 vs 6.0 eggs) at a\nslower rate (0.90 eggs day–1 vs 0.95 eggs\nday–1).

However, the physiological role of takeout and its\nputative link to JH remain unknown. In this study, we show that\ntakeout (to1) flies failed to adapt their food\nintake according to food availability and that most defects could be\ngenetically rescued.

When food reappears\nafter a starvation period, to1 flies do not increase their\nfood intake as much as wild-type flies. This defect in food intake regulation\nis partly based on the action of Takeout on taste neurons, because the\nsensitivity of to1 gustatory neurons to sugars does not\nincrease after starvation, as in wild-type neurons. This lack of regulation is\nalso evident at the locomotor activity, which normally increases during\nstarvation, a behaviour related to food foraging. In addition,\nto1 flies lack sexual dimorphism of locomotor activity,\nwhich has previously been linked to the JH circulating level.

The mechanisms of action of\npolymer-mediated neurorepair/neuroprotection are still under investigation. It\nis likely that the unique interaction of hydrophilic polymers with the\nmechanical properties of cell membranes in concert with an ability to\ninterfere with mechanisms of secondary injury such as the production of highly\nreactive oxygen species (ROS or `free radicals') is the basis for\nneuroprotection by polymers.Here we provide further evidence that the ability of PEG to reduce or limit\nsecondary injury and/or lipid peroxidation (LPO) of membranes requires entry\nof PEG into the cytosol, further suggesting a physical interaction with the\nmembranes of organelles such as mitochondria as the initial event leading to\nneurorepair/neuroprotection.We have evaluated this relationship in vitro using acrolein, a\npotent endogenous toxin that is a product of LPO.

Furthermore, in compromised cells\nwith an intact cell membrane, PEG must first gain access to the cytosol where\nthis same capability may be useful in restoring the integrity of cellular\norganelles such as mitochondria, though the intracellular concentration of the\npolymer must be significant relative to the concentration of toxins produced\nby LPO in order to rescue the cell."},{"title":"A vacuolar-type H+-ATPase and a Na+/H+\nexchanger contribute to intracellular pH regulation in cockroach salivary\nducts","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/8/1463","abstract":"Cells of the dopaminergically innervated salivary ducts in the cockroach\nPeriplaneta americana have a vacuolar-type H+-ATPase\n(V-ATPase) of unknown function in their apical membrane.

Many snakes\nare arboreal and their elongate bodies are theoretically well suited for\nbridging gaps.

Thus, we\nvideotaped and quantified maximal gap-bridging ability in a highly arboreal\nspecies of snake (Boiga irregularis), for which we were able to\nobtain a large range in snout–vent length (SVL=43–188 cm)\nand mass (10–1391 g). We expected smaller snakes to bridge relatively\nlarger gaps than larger individuals because of their proportionately higher\nratio of muscle cross-sectional area to mass. The maximal length of the gaps\nspanned by B. irregularis had negative allometry, indicating that\nsmaller snakes could span a greater proportion of their length than larger\nsnakes. The greatest relative gap distance spanned (64% SVL) was by\nthe smallest individual. The majority of snakes (85%) simply crawled slowly to\ncross a gap. Most of the suspended portion of the body and the path traveled\nby the head were below the perch that supported the posterior body, which may\ndecrease the tendency of the snake to roll. Some (15%) of the snakes used\nanother behavior in which the neck inclined as much as 45° and then\nrapidly lunged towards the anterior perch, and this enabled them to cross\nlarger gaps than those using the crawling behavior. Perhaps the launching\nbehavior of the gliding tree snakes (Chrysopelea sp.) evolved from an\nancestral behavior of lunging to bridge gaps analogous to that of the brown\ntree snakes. An estimate of the muscle strain required to prevent the body of\nthe snake from buckling suggests that, despite being light-bodied, brown tree\nsnakes bridging a gap may be at the limit of the physiological capacity of\ntheir epaxial muscles."},{"title":"Lipid mobilization of long-distance migrant birds in vivo: the\nhigh lipolytic rate of ruff sandpipers is not stimulated during\nshivering","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/7/1161","abstract":"For long migrations, birds must rely on high flux capacities at all steps\nof lipid metabolism, from the mobilization of adipose reserves to fatty acid\noxidation in flight muscle mitochondria.

In\nthis study, we have quantified the effects of cold exposure because such\nmeasurements are presently impossible during flight. Lipolytic rate was\nmonitored by continuous infusion of 2-[3H]-glycerol and lipid\noxidation by respirometry. Plasma lipid concentrations (non-esterified fatty\nacids, neutral lipids and phospholipids) and their fatty acid composition were\nalso measured to assess whether cold exposure causes selective metabolism of\nspecific lipids. Results show that shivering leads to a 47% increase in\nmetabolic rate (44.4±3.8 ml O2kg–1\nmin–1 to 65.2±8.1 ml O2\nkg–1 min–1), almost solely by stimulating\nlipid oxidation (33.3± 3.3 ml O2 kg–1\nmin–1 to 48.2±6.8 ml O2\nkg–1 min–1) because carbohydrate oxidation\nremains close to 11.5± 0.5 ml O2 kg–1\nmin–1. Sandpipers support an unusually high lipolytic rate of\n55–60 μmol glycerol kg–1 min–1. Its\nstimulation above thermoneutral rates is unnecessary during shivering when the\nbirds are still able to re-esterify 50% of released fatty acids. No changes in\nplasma lipid composition were observed, suggesting that cold exposure does not\nlead to selective metabolism of particular fatty acids.

For\n22°C-acclimated sea bass, heart rate was significantly higher, but maximum\nstroke volume was reduced by 22% (1.05±0.05 ml kg–1)\ncompared with 18°C (1.38± 0.11 ml kg–1). As a\nresult, maximum cardiac output (99.4±3.9 ml min–1\nkg–1) was not significantly different at 22°C. Instead,\nmaximum power output was 27% higher at 22°C (14.95±0.96 mW\ng–1) compared with 18°C, primarily because of the smaller\nrelative ventricular mass in 22°C-acclimated sea bass. Compared with tonic\nadrenergic stimulation with 5 nmol l–1 adrenaline, maximum\nadrenergic stimulation of the sea bass heart produced only modest stimulatory\neffects at both temperatures (12–13% and 14–15% increases in\nmaximum cardiac output and power output, respectively, with no chronotropic\neffect). Adrenergic stimulation also increased the cardiac sensitivity to\nfilling pressure, with the maximum left-shift in the Starling curve being\nproduced by 50–100 nmol l–1 adrenaline at 18°C and\n10–50 nmol l–1 adrenaline at 22°C. We show that the\nsea bass, which lacks a coronary arterial oxygen supply to the ventricle, has\na powerful heart. Its maximum performance is comparable to a salmonid heart,\nas is the modest stimulatory effect of adrenaline at high temperature."},{"title":"One-trial conditioned taste aversion in Lymnaea: good and poor\nperformers in long-term memory acquisition","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/7/1225","abstract":"In the majority of studies designed to elucidate the causal mechanisms of\nmemory formation, certain members of the experimental cohort, even though\nsubjected to exactly the same conditioning procedures, remember significantly\nbetter than others, whereas others show little or no long-term memory (LTM)\nformation.

The\nlong flights had no detectable effects on humoral or cell-mediated immune\nresponses, or on corticosterone levels.

In this study, in\nvitro contractile properties of three feeding muscles were determined for\na series of different sizes of African air-breathing catfishes (Clarias\ngariepinus). These muscles were the mouth closer musculus adductor\nmandibulae A2A3′, the mouth opener m. protractor hyoidei and the\nhypaxial muscles responsible for pectoral girdle retraction.

This suggests that proximal muscles produce the increased mechanical\nwork associated with moving up an incline.

This study uses in\nvivo bone strain data from the mandibular corpus to test two hypotheses\nregarding bite force modulation during rhythmic mastication in mammals: (1)\nthat bite force is modulated by varying the duration of force production, or\n(2) that bite force is modulated by varying the rate at which force is\nproduced. The data sample consists of rosette strain data from 40 experiments\non 11 species of mammals, including six primate genera and four nonprimate\nspecies: goats, pigs, horses and alpacas. Bivariate correlation and multiple\nregression methods are used to assess relationships between maximum\n(ϵ1) and minimum (ϵ2) principal strain\nmagnitudes and the following variables: loading time and mean loading rate\nfrom 5% of peak to peak strain, unloading time and mean unloading rate from\npeak to 5% of peak strain, chew cycle duration, and chew duty factor.\nBivariate correlations reveal that in the majority of experiments strain\nmagnitudes are significantly (P<0.001) correlated with strain\nloading and unloading rates and not with strain loading and unloading times.\nIn those cases when strain magnitudes are also correlated with loading times,\nstrain magnitudes are more highly correlated with loading rate than loading\ntime. Multiple regression analyses reveal that variation in strain magnitude\nis best explained by variation in loading rate. Loading time and related\ntemporal variables (such as overall chew cycle time and chew duty factor) do\nnot explain significant amounts of additional variance. Few and only weak\ncorrelations were found between strain magnitude and chew cycle time and chew\nduty factor. These data suggest that bite force modulation during rhythmic\nmastication in mammals is mainly achieved by modulating the rate at which\nforce is generated within a chew cycle, and less so by varying temporal\nparameters. Rate modulation rather than time modulation may allow rhythmic\nmastication to proceed at a relatively constant frequency, simplifying motor\ncontrol computation.)"},{"title":"Characterization of very-low density lipoprotein particle diameter dynamics in relation to egg production in a passerine bird","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/6/1064","abstract":"During avian egg production, oestrogen mediates marked increases in hepatic\nlipid production and changes in the diameter of assembled very-low density\nlipoprotein (VLDL).

As predicted, there was considerable overlap between\nthe VLDL particle diameter distributions of laying and non-laying zebra\nfinches. But unexpectedly, non-laying zebra finches had VLDL diameter\ndistributions that peaked at small particles and had relatively few large VLDL\nparticles. As a result, laying zebra finches, in comparison, had diameter\ndistributions that were shifted towards larger VLDL particles. Nevertheless,\nlaying zebra finches, like laying chickens, had larger proportions of\nparticles within proposed VLDLy particle diameter ranges than non-laying zebra\nfinches (e.g. sVLDLy: 50% vs 37%). Furthermore, zebra finches and\nchickens had similar modal (29.7 nm in both species) and median (32.7 nm\nvs 29.6 nm) VLDL particle diameters during egg production. Therefore,\nalthough zebra finches and chickens exhibited opposing directional shifts in\nVLDL particle diameter distribution during egg production, the modifications\nto VLDL particle structure in both species resulted in the realization of a\ncommon goal, i.e. to produce and maintain a large proportion of small VLDL\nparticles of specific diameters that are capable of being incorporated into\nnewly forming egg yolks.)"},{"title":"TTX-sensitive and TTX-insensitive control of spontaneous gut motility in\nthe developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/6/1084","abstract":"Spontaneous regular gut motility in zebrafish begins around 4 days post\nfertilisation (d.p.f.) and is modulated by release of acetylcholine and nitric\noxide.

Our goal was to explore the\nfunction of Eimer's organ by recording primary afferent responses to a range\nof mechanosensory stimuli.

Stimuli included static indentations, sinusoidal displacements,\ndifferent indentation velocities, displacement amplitudes, and directional\nstimuli across the skin. Receptive fields were small, sometimes restricted to\nsingle Eimer's organs. Responses were consistent with a slowly adapting Merkel\ncell-neurite complex-like receptor class and a dynamically sensitive\nPacinian-like rapidly adapting class. A second rapidly adapting class was\nhypothesized to represent activity of prominent free nerve endings within a\ncentral cell column.

PGI genotypes\ndiffer in heat and cold tolerance and in expression of a 70 kDa heat shock\nprotein. Here we examine genetic, behavioral and environmental factors\naffecting a performance character, running speed, for willow beetles, and\nassess effects of consecutive cold and heat exposure on running speed and\nexpression of Hsp70 in the laboratory. In nature, running speed depends on air\ntemperature and is higher for males than females. Mating beetles ran faster\nthan single beetles, and differences among PGI genotypes in male running speed\ndepended on the presence of females. In the laboratory, exposure to cold\nreduced subsequent running speed, but the amount of this reduction depended on\nPGI genotype and previous thermal history. Effects of exposure to heat also\ndepended on life history stage and PGI genotype. Adults possessing allele 1\nran fastest after a single exposure to stressful temperature, whereas those\npossessing allele 4 ran faster after repeated exposure. Larvae possessing\nallele 4 ran fastest after a single stressful exposure, but running speed\ngenerally declined after a second exposure to stressful temperature. The\nranking of PGI genotypes after the second exposure depended on whether a larva\nhad been exposed to cold or heat. Effects of temperature on Hsp70 expression\nalso varied among PGI genotypes and depended on type of exposure, especially\nfor adults (single heat exposure, two cold exposures: PGI 1-1>1-4>4-4;\nother multiple extreme exposures: 4-4>1-4>1-1). There was no consistent\nassociation between alleles at other polymorphic enzyme loci and running speed\nor Hsp70 expression. These data suggest that variation at PGI is associated\nwith considerable plasticity in running speed.

Survival rates were further increased when rehydration was\nperformed at 100% RH, rather than by direct contact with water. Two days at\n98.2% RH resulted in a ∼30% loss of OAW, and dramatically increased the\nfreeze tolerance of larvae to –10 and –15°C.

Because gel and intervening embryos retard oxygen\nflux, such a life-history mode profoundly affects partial pressures of\nmetabolic gases surrounding embryos. However, little is known about\nrelationships between egg-mass structure and the opportunities and constraints\nimposed on structure by metabolic gas transport. We examined the effects of\nfour factors (temperature, embryo age, embryo density and egg-mass size) on\nthe metabolism of egg masses using both natural egg masses of a nudibranch and\nartificial egg masses made from sand dollar embryos and low-melting point\nagarose. Both temperature and embryo age strongly affected metabolic rates of\nnudibranch embryos. For embryos of a given age (stage), rates of oxygen\nconsumption roughly doubled between 12 and 21°C; from early cleavage to\nthe veliger stage, consumption rose two- to fourfold, depending on\ntemperature. Oxygen profiles in egg masses showed that advanced embryonic age,\nand to a lesser extent high temperature, both led to steeper oxygen gradients\ninto egg masses. Egg masses containing advanced embryos at 21°C had very\nlow central oxygen levels. Small-diameter artificial masses (2 mm diameter)\nhad virtually no internal oxygen gradients regardless of embryo density or\ntemperature, while medium (4 mm) and large diameter (10 mm) artificial masses\nhad oxygen profiles that depended strongly and interactively on embryo density\nand temperature. Together, our data on natural and artificial egg masses\nsuggest that (i) multiple factors have strong effects on metabolic rate; (ii)\nrates of oxygen transport are relatively invariant with temperature in simple,\nartificial systems but may vary more strongly with temperature in natural egg\nmasses; and (iii) the four factors – temperature, embryo age, embryo\ndensity and egg-mass size – interact in important ways bearing on egg\nmass design.A simple mathematical model is developed to provide a quantitative means of\nestimating primary and interactive effects of the different factors.

In contrast, running\ninvolves in-phase fluctuations of the mechanical energy components of the body\ncentre of mass, allowing elastic energy recovery. We show that, when\nconstantly accelerating across the transition speed, humans make the switch\nfrom walking to running abruptly in one single step. In this step, active\nmechanical energy input triples the normal step-by-step energy increment\nneeded to power the imposed constant acceleration. This extra energy is needed\nto launch the body into the flight phase of the first running step and to\nbring the trunk into its more inclined orientation during running. Locomotor\ncycles immediately proceed with the typical in-phase fluctuations of kinetic\nand potential energy. As a result, the pendular energy transfer drops in one\nstep from 43% to 5%. Kinematically, the transition step is achieved by landing\nwith the knee and hip significantly more flexed compared to the previous\nwalking steps. Flexion in these joints continues during the first half of\nstance, thus bringing the centre of mass to its deepest position halfway\nthrough stance phase to allow for the necessary extension to initiate the\nrunning gait.

Thirteen crab species from two families were used in\nthis study. These crabs lived in five different habitats, including marine,\nintertidal, bimodal, freshwater and terrestrial habitats.

With that major component of their\nsense of graviception eliminated, one would expect the ants to disregard, or\nat least misgauge, the ascents and descents performed across hills during\noutbound journey. The ants should thus consider the (much longer) actual\nwalking trajectory, instead of the base distance, when calculating their\nhoming distance. Surprisingly, neither shaving nor immobilisation of the hair\nsensillae affected correct path integration, across both uneven terrain (3-D)\nand level surface. If anything, the ants underestimated homing distance, which\nmay reflect a general, safety-oriented navigation strategy. Animals that had\nperformed the outbound journey with their gaster fixed in a horizontal\nposition underestimated their homing so dramatically that this latter\nexplanation cannot hold."},{"title":"Serotonin stimulates [Ca2+]i elevation in ciliary\nectodermal cells of echinoplutei through a serotonin receptor cell network in\nthe blastocoel","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/3/403","abstract":"A full-length serotonin receptor mRNA from the 5Hthpr gene was\nsequenced from larvae of the sea urchin, Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus.\nThe DNA sequence was most similar to 5HT-1A of the sea urchin\nStrongylocentrotus purpuratus found by The Sea Urchin Genome Project,\nand the protein sequence predicted the presence of seven transmembrane\ndomains.

Therefore, we hypothesized that tissue incorporation of\nn-3 PUFA would be associated with increases in the activity of key muscle\nenzymes to upregulate energy metabolism for prolonged exercise.Birds were collected at various stages of fat loading to monitor changes in\nlipid composition and flight muscle enzymes simultaneously. Enzymes were\nmeasured to assess oxidative capacity [citrate synthase (CS)],β\n-oxidation [carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) and 3-hydroxyacyl\ndehydrogenase (HOAD)] and glycolytic capacity [lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)].\nChanges in the fatty acid composition of muscle membranes (phospholipids) and\nfuel reserves (neutral lipids) were measured separately to distinguish between\nmembrane-related and systemic effects of n-3 PUFA. Results show that muscle CS\nand HOAD are stimulated during refueling and that their activities are\ncorrelated with n-3 PUFA content in phospholipids (22:6 for CS, 20:5 for HOAD)\nand in neutral lipids (20:5 for CS). This suggests that 20:5 and 22:6 have\ndifferent effects on energy metabolism and that they act via changes\nin membrane structure and systemic mechanisms. CPT and LDH did not change\nduring refueling, but LDH activity was significantly related to the n-3 PUFA\ncontent of fuel reserves.

We examined how temperature acclimation, oxygen deprivation,\nacidosis, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia and adrenaline affect chronotropy in the\nturtle myocardium. We monitored spontaneous contraction rates of right-atrial\npreparations obtained from 21°C- and 5°C-acclimated turtles that had\nbeen exposed to either normoxia or anoxia (6 h at 21°C; 2 weeks at\n5°C). Sequential exposures to saline solutions were designed to mimic, in\na step-wise manner, the shift from a normoxic to anoxic extracellular\ncondition (for normoxia-acclimated preparations) or the reverse (for\nanoxia-acclimated preparations). Our results clearly show that prolonged\nanoxia exposure re-sets the intrinsic fH of turtles at\nboth temperatures, with reductions in intrinsic fH in the\nrange of 25%–53% compared with normoxia. This intrinsic change would\ncontribute to the bradycardia observed with prolonged anoxia. Further, we\nfound negative chronotropic effects of extracellular anoxia, acidosis and\nhyperkalemia, and positive chronotropic effects of hypercalcemia and\nadrenaline. The exact nature of these extracellular effects depended, however,\non the acclimation temperature and the prior exposure of the animal to anoxia.\nWith normoxia-acclimated preparations at 21°C, combined anoxia and\nacidosis (pH reduced from ∼7.8 to ∼7.2) significantly reduced\nspontaneous fH by 22% and subsequent exposure to\nhyperkalemia (3.5 mmol l–1K+) further decreased\nfH. These negative chronotropic effects were ameliorated\nby increasing the adrenaline concentration from the tonic level of 1 nmol\nl–1 to 60 nmol l–1. However, in\nanoxia-acclimated preparations at 21°C, anoxia alone inhibited\nfH (by ∼30%). This negative chronotropic effect was\ncounteracted by both hypercalcemia (6 mmol l–1\nCa2+) and adrenaline (60 nmol l–1). At 5°C,\nonly the combination of anoxia, acidosis (pH reduced from ∼8.0 to∼\n7.5) and hyperkalemia (3.5 mmol l–1 K+)\nsignificantly reduced spontaneous fH (by 23%) with\npreparations from normoxia-acclimated turtles.

Anatomical dissections showed, however, not only that\ndirect sperm deposition into the pouch is physically impossible, but that\nspermatozoa must somehow travel a significant distance (>4 mm) outside the\nbody of the male, to reach and fertilise eggs in the pouch. Observations of\ncourtship and mating behaviour also revealed that the pouch closes immediately\nafter mating, and that sperm transfer must occur within a time window of no\nmore than 6 s. In addition to this, the yellow seahorse produces\nextraordinarily low quantities of dimorphic spermatozoa, but is nevertheless\nhighly fertile and can produce broods that exceed 100 embryos. The entire\nfertilisation process in seahorses is therefore uniquely efficient among\nvertebrates, yet paradoxically involves several steps that would seem to\ncomplicate, and even appear to prevent, the interaction of the gametes.\nAlthough we are still unable to describe the exact fertilisation mechanism, we\nspeculate that spermatozoa are ejaculated into a mixture of ovarian fluid and\neggs, while the male and female are in close contact.

Associated with these anatomical modifications, morays showed no\nevidence of using suction during prey capture. From 59 video sequences of\nmorays feeding on pieces of cut squid we saw no hyoid depression and no\nmovement of prey toward the mouth aperture during the strike, a widely used\nindicator of suction-induced water flow. This was in contrast to A.\nrostrata, which exhibited a robust hyoid, sternohyoideus muscle and\npectoral girdle, and used suction to draw prey into its mouth. Average prey\ncapture time in morays, about 500 ms, was roughly 10 times longer than in\nA. rostrata, and morays frequently reversed the direction of jaw and\nhead rotation in the midst of the strike. We tested whether the absence of\nsuction feeding reduces temporal constraints on feeding kinematics, permitting\ngreater variance in traits that characterize timing and the extent of motion\nin the neurocranium, by comparing moray eel species with A. rostrata,\ntwo Centrarchids and a cichlid.

Trials were videotaped at high speed using a camera positioned\nperpendicular to the runway, and velocity was measured using photosensors. The\ntrailing forelimb applied greater peak vertical forces than the lead forelimb,\nhowever the vertical impulses from the two forelimbs were similar because the\nlead forelimb had a longer contact interval. The trailing forelimb and lead\nhindlimb applied greater peak accelerating forces and accelerating force\nimpulses than their contralateral limbs despite their tendency to have shorter\ncontact intervals. The accelerating impulse of both forelimbs combined did not\ndiffer significantly from that of both hindlimbs. The forelimbs applied a\ngreater decelerating impulse than the hindlimbs, such that their net fore-aft\nimpulse was decelerating whereas that of the hindlimbs was accelerating. The\ngreater accelerating impulse applied by the trailing forelimb and greater\ndecelerating impulse applied by the lead forelimb are consistent with the\nforelimbs acting as elastic struts rather than being actively retracted. In\ncontrast, greater accelerating forces were produced by the lead hindlimb while\nthe center of mass was lifted, suggesting that the hindlimbs are more actively\nextended or retracted during stance. The differences in ground forces measured\nbetween paired limbs suggest that the lead forelimb and trailing hindlimb are\nlimited in their ability to apply forces by their positions in the stride\ncycle rather than by their muscular capacity. Although a bound or half-bound\nwould allow more limbs to produce their maximal forces, a gallop may generate\nhigher speeds because it is more efficient.

Likewise, no changes were noted in the\nwater balance of pupae, indicating that diapause-related changes do not occur\nprior to adult eclosion. This mosquito does not replenish internal water\nstores by generating metabolic water or by absorbing vapor from the\natmosphere, but instead relies on drinking liquid water (or blood feeding in\nthe case of nondiapausing females). The critical transition temperature, a\npoint where water loss increases rapidly with temperature, was the highest for\nfemales, then males, then pupae, but was not influenced by the diapause\nprogram. Females in diapause did not utilize common polyols (glycerol,\ntrehalose and sorbitol) to retain water, but instead the presence of twice the\namount of cuticular hydrocarbons in diapausing compared with nondiapausing\nfemales suggests that the deposition of hydrocarbons contribute to the reduced\nrates of water loss. The laboratory results were also verified in\nfield-collected specimens: mosquitoes in the late fall and winter had a lower\npercentage water content and water loss rate, higher initial mass, dry mass\nand more cuticular hydrocarbons than individuals collected during the summer.\nThus, the major features of diapause that contribute to the suppression of\nwater loss are the large size of diapausing females (reduction of surface area\nto volume ratio lowers cuticular water loss), their low metabolic rate and the\ndeposition of extra cuticular hydrocarbons."},{"title":"The desert ant odometer: a stride integrator that accounts for stride length and walking speed","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/2/198","abstract":"Desert ants, Cataglyphis, use path integration as a major means of\nnavigation.

We studied this question using\nthe multifunctional feeding apparatus of the marine mollusk Aplysia\ncalifornica, in which the same muscles mediate biting (an attempt to\ngrasp food) and swallowing (ingestion of food). Biting and swallowing\nresponses were compared using magnetic resonance imaging of intact, behaving\nanimals and a three-dimensional kinematic model. Biting is associated with\nlarger amplitude protractions of the grasper (radula/odontophore) than\nswallowing, and smaller retractions. Larger biting protractions than in\nswallowing appear to be due to a more anterior position of the grasper as the\nbehavior begins, a larger amplitude contraction of protractor muscle I2, and\ncontraction of the posterior portion of the I1/I3/jaw complex. The posterior\nI1/I3/jaw complex may be context-dependent, i.e. its mechanical context\nchanges the direction of the force it exerts. Thus, the posterior of I1/I3 may\naid protraction near the peak of biting, whereas the entire I1/I3/jaw complex\nacts as a retractor during swallowing. In addition, larger amplitude closure\nof the grasper during swallowing allows an animal to exert more force as it\ningests food.

We measured total body\noxygen stores, including hematocrit, hemoglobin, MCHC, plasma volume, blood\nvolume and muscle myoglobin in pups through adults of both sexes. Blood and\nmuscle oxygen storage capacity was not fully developed by the end of the\ndependency period, with blood stores not fully developed until animals were\nlarger juveniles (70 kg; 1.5-2.5 years) and muscle stores not until animals\nwere sub-adult size (125 kg; 4-6 years).

Male sea lions had greater absolute blood volume\nthan females and reflected the larger mass of males, which became apparent\nwhen animals were large juveniles. Adult female sea lions had greater muscle\nmyoglobin concentrations compared to males, resulting in greater mass-specific\nmuscle and total oxygen stores. Delayed development of oxygen stores is\nconsistent with the shallow epi-mesopelagic foraging behavior in this species.\nWe hypothesize that the greater mass-specific oxygen stores of female sea\nlions compared to males is related to differences in foraging behavior between\nthe sexes."},{"title":"Parameters of variable reward distributions that affect risk sensitivity of honey bees","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/2/269","abstract":"We investigated risk sensitivity with harnessed honey bees in a\nproboscis-extension conditioning paradigm.

Six feeding events of rations between 2.1-8.5% body mass\n(%Mb) of Australian sardines (Sardinops\nneopilchardus) were recorded (two of the groups were fed twice). Before\nfeeding, fish swam between 0.71 and 1.4 body lengths s-1\n(BL s-1) and the routine metabolic rate (RMR) was\n366±32.5 mg kg-1 h-1 (mean ± s.e.m.). For\nall trials, ṀO2\nwas elevated post feeding, presumably as a result of specific dynamic action\n(SDA). Swimming velocity was also elevated post feeding for periods similar to\nthat of ṀO2\n(between 20-45 h, longest for the largest rations). Post feeding swimming\nvelocity increased to between 0.87-2.6 BL s-1 and was also\ndependent on ration consumed. It is suggested that the purpose of increased\npost-feeding swimming velocity was to increase ventilation volume as a\nresponse to the enhanced metabolic demand associated with SDA. Peak\npost-prandial ṀO2\nincreased linearly with ration size to a maximum of 1290 mg kg-1\nh-1, corresponding to 2.8 times the RMR.

Differences noted in the\nstreamline pattern, and hence the vorticity, dissipation rate and strain rate\nfields, are explained by considering the forces on the free-swimming specimen\ncompared to the tethered specimen.

This allows these fish to head straight\ntowards the later point of catch with a speed matched to the distance to be\ncovered. To make the catch despite severe competition the fish must quickly\nand yet precisely match their turn and take-off speed to the initial values of\nprey motion. However, the initial variables vary over broad ranges and can be\ndetermined only after prey is dislodged. Therefore, the underlying neuronal\ncircuitry must be able to drive a maneuver that combines a high degree of\nprecision and flexibility at top speed. To narrow down which neuronal\nsubstrate underlies the performance we characterized the kinematics of archer\nfish predictive starts using digital high-speed video. Strikingly, the\npredictive starts show all hallmarks of Mauthner-driven teleost C-type\nfast-starts, which have previously not been noted in feeding strikes and were\nnot expected to provide the high angular accuracy required. The high demands\non flexibility and precision of the predictive starts do not compromise their\nperformance. On the contrary, archer fish predictive starts are among the\nfastest C-starts known so far among teleost fish, with peak linear speed\nbeyond 20 body lengths s-1, angular speed over 4500 deg.\ns-1, maximum linear acceleration of up to 12 times gravitational\nacceleration and peak angular acceleration of more than 450 000 deg.\ns-2. Moreover, they were not slower than archer fish escape\nC-starts, elicited in the same individuals. Rather, both escapes and\npredictive starts follow an identical temporal pattern and all kinematic\nvariables of the two patterns overlap. This kinematic equivalence strongly\nsuggests that archer fish recruit their C-start escape network of identified\nreticulospinal neurons, or elements of it, to drive their predictive starts.\nHow the network drives such a rather complex behavior without compromising\nspeed is a wide open question."},{"title":"Genetic dissection of attractant-induced conductances in\nParamecium","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/2/357","abstract":"Paramecium tetraurelia is attracted to acetate and biotin by\nswimming smoothly and fast up gradients of these attractants, and turning\nimmediately and slowing down when leaving these stimuli.

Because of\nthe location of dorsal fins above the fish's rolling axis, these lateral\nforces, if unchecked, would cause fish to roll. In this paper we examine the\nhydrodynamics of trout anal fin function and hypothesize that anal fins,\nlocated below the fish's rolling axis, produce similar jets to the dorsal fin\nand help balance rolling torques during swimming. We simultaneously quantify\nthe wake generated by dorsal and anal fins in brook trout by swimming fish in\ntwo horizontal light sheets filmed by two synchronized high speed cameras\nduring steady swimming and manoeuvring. Six major conclusions emerge from\nthese experiments.First, anal fins produce lateral jets to the same side as dorsal fins,\nconfirming the hypothesis that anal fins produce fluid jets that balance those\nproduced by dorsal fins. Second, in contrast to previous work on sunfish,\nneither dorsal nor anal fins produce significant thrust during steady\nswimming; flow leaves the dorsal and anal fins in the form of a shear layer\nthat rolls up into vortices similar to those seen in steady swimming of eels.\nThird, dorsal and anal fin lateral jets are more coincident in time than would\nbe predicted from simple kinematic expectations; shape, heave and pitch\ndifferences between fins, and incident flow conditions may account for the\ndifferences in timing of jet shedding. Fourth, relative force and torque\nmagnitudes of the anal fin are larger than those of the dorsal fin; force\ndifferences may be due primarily to a larger span and a more squarely shaped\ntrailing edge of the anal fin compared to the dorsal fin; torque differences\nare also strongly influenced by the location of each fin relative to the\nfish's centre of mass. Fifth, flow is actively modified by dorsal and anal\nfins resulting in complex flow patterns surrounding the caudal fin. The caudal\nfin does not encounter free-stream flow, but rather moves through incident\nflow greatly altered by the action of dorsal and anal fins. Sixth, trout anal\nfin function differs from dorsal fin function; although dorsal and anal fins\nappear to cooperate functionally, there are complex interactions between other\nfins and free stream perturbations that require independent dorsal and anal\nfin motion and torque production to maintain control of body position."},{"title":"Experimental study of coordination patterns during unsteady locomotion in mammals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/2/366","abstract":"A framework to study interlimb coordination, which allowed the analysis of\nall the symmetrical and asymmetrical gaits, was recently proposed.

These three time parameters are\nsufficient for identifying all steady gaits. We assumed in this work that this\nsame framework could also be used to study non-steady locomotion, particularly\nthe transitions between symmetrical and asymmetrical gaits.

The results demonstrated that the APS method allows\nquantification of the interlimb coordination during the symmetrical and\nasymmetrical phases and during the transition between them, in both dogs and\ncats. The space and time parameters make it possible to link the timing and\nthe spacing of the footfalls, and to quantify the spatiotemporal dimension of\ngaits in different mammals. The slight differences observed between dogs and\ncats could reflect their morphological differences.

Using a high-speed video camera (500 frames\ns-1), I captured locomotor and feeding movements in lateral and\nventral (via a mirror) view. Largemouth bass swam considerably faster\nthan bluegill during the approach to the prey item, and both species\ndecelerated substantially following prey capture. The mean magnitude of\ndeceleration was significantly higher in largemouth bass (-1089 cm\ns-2) than bluegill (-235 cm s-2), and the timing of\nmaximum deceleration was much later for largemouth bass (30.3 ms after maximum\ngape) than bluegill (6.7 ms after maximum gape). Both species employed their\npectoral, anal and caudal fins in order to decelerate during prey capture.\nHowever, largemouth bass protracted their pectoral fins more and faster,\nlikely contributing to the greater magnitude of deceleration in the species.\nThe primary mechanism for increased deceleration was an increase in approach\nspeed. The drag forces experienced by the fins and body are proportional to\nthe velocity of the flow squared. Thus, the braking forces exerted by fins,\nwithout any change in kinematics, will increase exponentially with small\nincreases in swimming speed, perhaps allowing these fishes to achieve higher\nbraking forces at higher swimming speeds without altering body or fin\nkinematics. This result can likely be extended to other maneuvers such as\nturning."},{"title":"Electromyography of the buccal musculature of octopus (Octopus\nbimaculoides): a test of the function of the muscle articulation in\nsupport and movement","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/1/118","abstract":"The buccal mass musculature of the octopus (Octopus bimaculoides)\nwas studied with electromyography to test the predictions of a previous\nmorphological study in which we suggested that the muscles of the buccal mass\nserve as both the effectors of movement and as the joint itself, forming a new\ncategory of flexible joint termed a `muscle articulation'.

This finding was supported by in vitro\norgan bath physiology, which demonstrated that the relaxation induced by\nacetylcholine (10-5 mol l-1) was abolished in the\npresence of the NOS inhibitor, N-omega-nitro-l-arginine\n(l-NNA; 10-4 mol l-1), the soluble guanylyl\ncyclase inhibitor, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ;\n10-5 mol l-1), or when the endothelium was removed.\nInterestingly, evidence for a neural NO pathway was also identified in large\narteries of the crocodile. Neural NOS was located in perivascular nerves of\nthe major blood vessels following NADPH-d histochemistry and neural NOS IHC\nand in isolated aortic rings, l-NNA and ODQ, but not the removal of\nthe endothelium, abolished the relaxation effect of the neural NOS agonist,\nnicotine (3×10-4 mol l-1).

Day-3 eggs also\ncontain the highest free [Ca2+] during early embryogenesis of this\ninsect.

Trout were studied shortly after the initial thermal\nchange and after 8 weeks acclimation to 15°C. To identify potential\nmechanisms by which oxidative capacities change, the modifications of\nphospholipid composition, membrane proteins and functional capacities of red\nmuscle mitochondria were examined. Marked functional changes of isolated\nmuscle mitochondria during warm acclimation of rainbow trout were reflected by\na host of modifications in phospholipid composition, but by few shifts in\nprotein components. Shortly after transfer of trout from 5°C to 15°C,\nthe maximal oxidative capacity of mitochondria measured at 15°C increased\nslightly, but rates at both assay temperatures (5°C and 15°C)\ndecreased markedly after warm acclimation. The increase in capacity in\nshort-term warm exposed trout was most pronounced when rates at 15°C were\nexpressed relative to cytochrome a and c1 levels.\nNon-phosphorylating (State 4) rates of oxygen uptake increased with short-term\nwarm exposure before returning to initial levels after warm acclimation.\nCytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity in the mitochondrial preparations\ndecreased with warm acclimation. The thermal sensitivity of the ADP affinity\nwas markedly modified during short-term warm exposure, when the ADP/O ratio\nincreased, but warm acclimation returned these values to those observed\ninitially. ADP affinity increased after warm acclimation. Changes in the\nmitochondrial content of cytochromes and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT)\ncould not explain these patterns. On the other hand, changes in the\nproportions of the lipid classes and in the acyl chain composition of certain\nphospholipid classes mirror the modifications in functional properties.\nShort-term exposure to 15°C decreased the ratio of\ndiacylphosphatidylethanolamine/diacylphosphatidylcholine (diacylPE/diacylPC),\nwhereas warm acclimation led to restructuring of fatty acids (FA) and to\nincreases of plasmalogen forms of PE and PC. Modification of overall membrane\nunsaturation did not appear to be the primary aim of restructuring membrane FA\nduring warm acclimation, as total mitochondrial phospholipids and the major\nphospholipid classes only showed slight shifts of their acyl composition with\nwarm acclimation. On the other hand, natural lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC)\nshowed dramatic changes in FA content, as 16:0 and 18:1n-9 doubled whereas\n22:6n-3 decreased from around 50% to 32% in warm acclimated trout. Similarly,\nin cardiolipin (CL), the levels of 16:0 and 18:1n-7 halved while 18:2n-6\nincreased to over 20% of the FA with warm acclimation. Given the central role\nof CL in modulating the activity of CCO, F0F1-ATPase and\nANT, these changes suggest that specific compositional changes in CL are\nimportant modulators of mitochondrial capacities. The many structural changes\nin membrane lipids contrast with the limited modifications of the membrane\nprotein components examined and support the concept of lipid structure\nmodulating mitochondrial capacities."},{"title":"No trade-off between biting and suction feeding performance in clariid catfishes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/1/27","abstract":"It is generally assumed that biting performance trades off with suction\nperformance in fish because both feeding types may place conflicting demands\non the cranial musculo-skeletal system.

In this study, suction feeding\nperformance was compared between three clariid catfish species differing\nconsiderably in their biting capacity, by measuring the velocity of a\nstandardized prey being sucked into the buccal cavity using high-speed\ncineradiography. In addition, buccal volume changes during prey capture were\nquantified by ellipse modelling. As all species were able to accelerate the\nprey to similar peak velocities, our results demonstrate the possibility for\ncatfishes to increase bite performance considerably without compromising\nsuction performance. The amount of buccal expansion in the ventral direction\nis approximately equal for all species. Consequently, the system generating\nexpansion through ventral rotation of the lower jaw, hyoid and pectoral girdle\nis apparently not constrained (mechanically or architectonically) by the\nhypertrophy of the jaw adductors. As the effect of a reduced magnitude of\nlateral expansion (suspensorium abduction) on suction performance in Clariidae\nappears to be negligible (for example in Gymnallabes typus), these\ndata demonstrate the dominant role of ventral expansion for producing suction\nin these fish."},{"title":"Echolocation and passive listening by foraging mouse-eared bats\nMyotis myotis and M. blythii","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/1/166","abstract":"The two sibling mouse-eared bats, Myotis myotis and M.\nblythii, cope with similar orientation tasks, but separate their trophic\nniche by hunting in species-specific foraging microhabitats.

We tested the\nhypothesis that mouse-eared bats continuously emit echolocation calls while\napproaching prey. Echolocation may be needed for orientation while\nsimultaneously listening for prey. Because these sibling species forage in\ndifferent microhabitats and eat different prey, we also compared their\necholocation behaviour and related it to their ecology. Both species used\necholocation throughout prey approach, corroborating a functional role for\necholocation during gleaning. Captive bats of both species emitted similar\norientation calls, and pulse rate increased during prey approach. Between the\nsearch to approach phases, call amplitude showed a sudden, dramatic drop and\nbats adopted `whispering echolocation' by emitting weak calls. Whispering\necholocation may reduce the risks of masking prey-generated sounds during\npassive listening, the mouse-eared bats' main detection tactic; it may also\navoid alerting ultrasound-sensitive prey. In several cases M. myotis\nemitted a loud buzz made of 2-18 components when landing. We hypothesise that\nthe buzz, absent in M. blythii at least when gleaning from the same\nsubstrate, is used to assess the distance from ground and refine the landing\nmanoeuvre. Our findings have implications for niche separation between sibling\nspecies of echolocating bats, support a role for echolocation during passive\nlistening and suggest a functional role for buzzes in landing control."},{"title":"Flower tracking in hawkmoths: behavior and energetics","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/1/37","abstract":"As hovering feeders, hawkmoths cope with flower motions by tracking those\nmotions to maintain contact with the nectary.

However, despite the attractive nature of this hypothesis,\nprevious studies have failed to show an association between BMR and fecundity.\nOur approach was to mate 304 C57BL/6J mice and allow them to wean pups before\nmeasuring BMR by indirect calorimetry.

This manuscript describes a newly\ndiscovered molt-dependent mechanism by which old sperm is periodically removed\nfrom the reproductive system of male Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp.\nFirstly, it is shown that the spermatophores of males held in captivity become\nprogressively melanized, a process that eventually renders them impotent.\nThen, by using melanin specks as a color marker, it is demonstrated that this\nphenomenon can be delayed and even reversed as long as the males remain\nsexually active. Lastly and most importantly, it is shown that male shrimp go\nthrough reproductive cycles that are strictly associated with their molt\ncycles, which, in turn, are hormonally regulated. Intact intermolt\nspermatophores disappeared about 12 h premolt, and a new pair of\nspermatophores appeared in the ampoules the day after the males had molted.\nThis phenomenon was observed in an almost constant portion of males, both\nthose in an all-male population and those in mixed male/female populations,\neven during the times that the females of those populations were not\nvitellogenically active.

The results of the present\nsimulations support the hypothesis that anguilliform swimmers modify their\nkinematics according to different objectives and provide a quantitative\nanalysis of the swimming motion and the forces experienced by the body.The kinematics of burst swimming is characterized by the large amplitude of\nthe tail undulations while the anterior part of the body remains straight. In\ncontrast, during efficient swimming behavior significant lateral undulation\noccurs along the entire length of the body. In turn, during burst swimming,\nthe majority of the thrust is generated at the tail, whereas in the efficient\nswimming mode, in addition to the tail, the middle of the body contributes\nsignificantly to the thrust. The burst swimming velocity is 42% higher and the\npropulsive efficiency is 15% lower than the respective values during efficient\nswimming.The wake, for both swimming modes, consists largely of a double row of\nvortex rings with an axis aligned with the swimming direction. The vortex\nrings are responsible for producing lateral jets of fluid, which has been\ndocumented in prior experimental studies. We note that the primary wake\nvortices are qualitatively similar in both swimming modes except that the wake\nvortex rings are stronger and relatively more elongated in the fast swimming\nmode.The present results provide quantitative information of three-dimensional\nfluid-body interactions that may complement related experimental studies. In\naddition they enable a detailed quantitative analysis, which may be difficult\nto obtain experimentally, of the different swimming modes linking the\nkinematics of the motion with the forces acting on the self-propelled body.\nFinally, the optimization procedure helps to identify, in a systematic\nfashion, links between swimming motion and biological function."},{"title":"Compensation for environmental change by complementary shifts of thermal sensitivity and thermoregulatory behaviour in an ectotherm","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/24/4869","abstract":"Thermoregulating animals are thought to have evolved a preferred body\ntemperature at which thermally sensitive performance is optimised.

Utilizing a magnetic tether in\nwhich flies are fixed in space but free to rotate about their yaw axis, we\nsystematically manipulated the feedback from the visual and haltere systems to\ntest their role in determining the time course of body saccades. We found that\naltering visual feedback had no significant effect on the dynamics of\nsaccades, whereas increasing and decreasing the amount of haltere-mediated\nfeedback decreased and increased saccade amplitude, respectively. In other\nexperiments, we altered the aerodynamic surface of the wings such that the\nflies had to actively modify their wing-stroke kinematics to maintain straight\nflight on the magnetic tether. Flies exhibit such modification, but the\ncontrol is compromised in the dark, indicating that the visual system does\nprovide feedback for flight stability at lower angular velocities, to which\nthe haltere system is less sensitive. Cutting the wing surface disrupted the\ntime course of the saccades, indicating that although flies employ sensory\nfeedback to modulate saccade dynamics, it is not precise or fast enough to\ncompensate for large changes in wing efficacy."},{"title":"Morphology and action of the hind leg joints controlling jumping in froghopper insects","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/23/4622","abstract":"The morphology and movements of key joints of the hind legs that generate\nthe rapid jumping of froghoppers were analysed. The movements of an individual\nhind leg during a jump occur in three phases. First, the trochanter is slowly\nlevated about the coxa so that the femur moves anteriorly and engages with a\nlateral protrusion on the coxa. Second, both hind legs are held in this fully\nlevated (cocked) position without moving for a few seconds. Third, both hind\nlegs depress and extend completely in less than 1 ms. The critical,\npower-generating movement underlying a jump is the rapid and simultaneous\ndepression of the trochantera about the coxae.The lever arm of the hind trochanteral depressor muscle is smallest at the\ncocked position, but does not appear to go over the centre of the pivot. It\nthen increases to a maximum after some 80° of depression movement. By\ncontrast, the lever arm of the trochanteral levator tendon is similar over the\nrange of joint movements and is exceeded by that of the depressor only after\n40° of depression. Three prominent arrays of hairs on the trochantin, coxa\nand trochanter are appropriately positioned to act as proprioceptors\nsignalling key movements in jumping.In the fully levated position, a protrusion on the dorsal, proximal surface\nof a hind femur engages with a protrusion from the ventral and lateral part of\na coxa. These structures are not present on the front and middle legs. Both\nprotrusions are covered with a dense array of small projections (microtrichia)\nthat both increase the surface area and may interlock with each other. To\ndepress rapidly in a jump these protrusions must disengage. If the hind leg of\na dead froghopper is forcibly levated, it will lock in its cocked position,\nfrom which it can depress rapidly by movement of the coxo-trochanteral joint\nand disengagement of the femoral and coxal protrusions. A prominent click\nsound occurs at the start of a jump that results either from the initial\nmovements of the coxo-trochanteral joint, or from the disengagement of the\nmicrotrichia on the coxa and femur. Larval Philaenus, which do not\njump, lack a femoral protrusion and have no microtrichia in equivalent\npositions on either the coxa or femur."},{"title":"P-type Na+/K+-ATPase and V-type\nH+-ATPase expression patterns in the osmoregulatory organs of\nlarval and adult mosquito Aedes aegypti","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/23/4638","abstract":"This study describes the expression patterns of P-type\nNa+/K+-ATPase and V-type H+-ATPase in the\nlarval and adult forms of the mosquito Aedes aegypti and provides\ninsight into their relative importance in ion transport function of key\nosmoregulatory organs. RT-PCR assays indicate that, at the level of the gene,\nboth ATPases are expressed in all of the osmoregulatory tissues of larvae\n(midgut, Malpighian tubules, rectum and anal papillae) and adults (stomach,\nMalpighian tubules, anterior hindgut and rectum). Immunohistochemical studies\ndetermined that both ATPases are present in high levels in all the relevant\norgans, with the exception of the larval rectum (P-type\nNa+/K+-ATPase only). In larval gastric caeca, ATPase\nlocation corresponds to the secretory (basal P-type\nNa+/K+-ATPase, apical V-type H+-ATPase) and\nion-transporting (V-type H+-ATPase on both membranes) regions as\npreviously described. The two ATPases switch membrane location along the\nlength of the larval midgut, indicating three possible regionalizations,\nwhereas the adult stomach has uniform expression of basolateral P-type\nNa+/K+-ATPase and apical V-type H+-ATPase in\neach cell. In both larval and adult Malpighian tubules, the distal principal\ncells exhibit high expression levels of V-type H+-ATPase (apically\nand cytoplasmically) whereas P-type Na+/K+-ATPase is\nhighly expressed in stellate cells found only in the distal two-thirds of each\ntubule. By contrast, the proximal principal cells express both P-type\nNa+/K+-ATPase (basal) and V-type H+-ATPase\n(apical).

Hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria, can\nsuffer high overwintering mortalities in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada. The\nselectively bred M. mercenaria var. notata can have higher\noverwintering mortalities than the wild species, thus suggesting that the two\nvarieties have different degrees of adaptation to low temperatures. The\nobjective of this study was to investigate the changes in lipid composition of\nsoft tissues in wild and selected hard clams in relation to their metabolic\nand genetic characteristics. Clams were placed at the northern limit of their\ndistribution from August 2003 to May 2004; they were exposed to a gradual\ntemperature decrease and then maintained at <0°C for 3.5 months. This\nstudy is the first to report a major remodeling of lipids in this species as\npredicted by HVA; this remodeling involved a sequential response of the\nphospholipid to sterol ratio as well as in levels of 22:6n-3 and non-methylene\ninterrupted dienoic fatty acids. Hard clams showed an increase in 20:5n-3 as\ntemperature decreased, but this was not maintained during overwintering, which\nsuggests that 20:5n-3 may have been used for eicosanoid biosynthesis as a\nstress response to environmental conditions. Selectively bred hard clams were\ncharacterized by a higher metabolic demand and a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg\nequilibrium at several genetic loci due to a deficit in heterozygote frequency\ncompared with wild clams, which is believed to impose additional stress and\nrender these animals more vulnerable to overwintering mortality. Finally, an\nintriguing finding is that the lower metabolic requirements of wild animals\ncoincide with a lower unsaturation index of their lipids, as predicted by\nHulbert's theory of membranes as pacemakers of metabolism."},{"title":"Photoperiod-induced plasticity of thermosensitivity and acquired\nthermotolerance in Locusta migratoria","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/23/4690","abstract":"The mechanisms by which different life histories affect neural circuits are\nlargely unknown.

Photoelectric recordings from pre-oral cilia on\nisolated pieces of velum revealed that serotonin increased, whereas\ncatecholamines (dopamine and norepinephrine) decreased beat frequency at\nconcentrations of 10-6 to 10-9 mol l-1.\nCatecholamines also increased the frequency of momentary, isolated arrests of\npre-oral cilia, but failed to suppress beating of the post-oral cilia at these\nconcentrations.

In terms of whole animal behaviour, serotonin caused larvae\nto concentrate toward the top of a water column and to increase feeding,\nwhereas catecholamines caused larvae to concentrate toward the bottom of a\nwater column and decrease feeding. Monoamine analogues which facilitated or\nopposed the effects of synthetic transmitters on larval behaviour, further\nsuggested that these transmitters are released endogenously to control velar\nfunction.

We trained free-flying\nGlossophaga soricina in echoacoustic discrimination in a\ntwo-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) paradigm at location A. We then tested\nat location B for spontaneous transfer of discrimination ability. Bats did not\nspontaneously transfer the discrimination ability acquired at A to location B.\nThis lack of spontaneous generalization may have been caused by factors of the\nunderlying learning mechanisms. 2-AFC tasks may not be representative of the\nnatural foraging behaviour of flower-visiting bats. In contrast to\ninsect-eating bats that constantly evaluate the environment to detect\nunpredictable prey, the spatial stability of flowers may allow flower visitors\nto rely on spatial memory to guide foraging. The 2-AFC task requires the\ndisregard (learned irrelevance) of salient spatial location cues that are\ndifferent at each new location. In Glossophaga, a conjunction between\nspatial context and 2-AFC discrimination learning may have inhibited the\ntransfer of learned irrelevance of spatial location in the 2-AFC task to new\nspatial locations. Alternatively, the bats may have learnt the second\ndiscrimination task completely anew, and were faster only because of an\nacquired learning set.

In this\nstudy, microspectrophotometry was used to measure the absorption spectra of\ncone oil droplets in chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) reared under\nbright (unfiltered) or dim (filtered) sunlight.

Calculations show that\nthe reduced levels of oil droplet pigmentation in chickens reared in dim light\nwould increase the sensitivity and spectral bandwidth of the outer segment\nsignificantly. The density of pigmentation in the oil droplets presumably\nrepresents a trade-off between the need for good colour discrimination and\nabsolute sensitivity.

Males produced more multi-peaked chirps\nthan females. Thus, the temporal structure of chirps, rather than the amount\nof FM, delineated chirp types in A. devenanzii.

Growth rate, photosynthetic efficiency\n(Fv/Fm), relative electron transport\nrate (ETR), zooxanthellae and chlorophyll (chl) contents were measured during\n48 days incubation. At 20°C, all parameters remained constant during the\nwhole experiment for both species. At higher temperatures, most physiological\nparameters were affected by only 2-5 weeks at 24°C, and were severely\ndepressed at higher temperatures. Small replicate samples (nubbins) of O.\npatagonica significantly decreased their zooxanthellae and chl\nconcentrations at all temperatures, after 2 weeks of incubation.

In addition, we used\nopportunistic water consumption by northern elephant seals to test a method to\ndistinguish between prey and water ingestion. Over 96% of feedings could be\nidentified based on a decline in stomach temperature, even when meals were\nseparated by as little as 70 min. Water consumption was distinguishable from\nprey consumption, as the rate of recovery in stomach temperature was\nsignificantly faster for water (F1,142=79.2,\nP<0.01). However, using this method, the overlap in recovery rates\nbetween prey and water resulted in 30.6% of water ingestion events being\nmisclassified as prey ingestion. For both species, the integral calculated\nfrom the decline in stomach temperature over time (area above the curve) could\nbe used to estimate mass consumed, when adjusted for the temperature\ndifference between the prey and core body temperature. For California sea\nlions, there was a significant effect of individual on the ability to quantify\nprey consumed, which was not related to their mass or sex. Although many\nfactors may influence the ability to use stomach temperature change to\nidentify and quantify prey consumed, this study has shown measures of stomach\ntemperature can accurately identify prey consumption and provide an estimate\nof meal mass, allowing for a greater understanding of the feeding behavior of\nmarine mammals."},{"title":"Response characteristics of visual altitude control system in Bombus\nterrestris","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/22/4533","abstract":"Frequency response characteristics of bumblebees to vertical visual\noscillations were measured and analyzed.

This\nlast idea is based on the hypothesis that carotenoids that are allocated to\nsexual signals are no longer available for the detoxification system.\nRecently, this hypothesis has been challenged on the grounds that the\nantioxidant activity is not the main biological role of carotenoids. Instead,\ncarotenoid-based sexual traits might signal the availability of other\nnon-pigmentary antioxidant molecules that might protect carotenoids from free\nradical attacks and make them available for sexual advertisements.

Thus, it can be concluded that 4 days of emersion\ncaused an increase in ammonia production in A. testudineus, and\nprobably because of this, a transient increase in the glutamine content in the\nbrain occurred. Because there was a significant increase in the total\nessential free amino acid in the experimental fish after 2 days of emersion,\nit can be deduced that increased ammonia production during emersion was a\nresult of increased amino acid catabolism and protein degradation. Our results\nprovide evidence for the first time that A. testudineus was able to\ncontinually excrete ammonia in water containing 12 mmol l-1\nNH4Cl. During emersion, active ammonia excretion apparently\noccurred across the branchial and cutaneous surfaces, and ammonia\nconcentrations in water samples collected from these surfaces increased to 20\nmmol l-1. It is probable that the capacities of airbreathing and\nactive ammonia excretion facilitated the utilization of amino acids by A.\ntestudineus as an energy source to support locomotor activity during\nemersion. As a result, it is capable of wandering long distance on land from\none water body to another as reported in the literature."},{"title":"Aquatic turning performance of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta)\nand functional consequences of a rigid body design","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/21/4203","abstract":"The ability to capture prey and avoid predation in aquatic habitats depends\nstrongly on the ability to perform unsteady maneuvers (e.g. turns), which\nitself depends strongly on body flexibility. Two previous studies of turning\nperformance in rigid-bodied taxa have found either high maneuverability or\nhigh agility, but not both. However, examinations of aquatic turning\nperformance in rigid-bodied animals have had limited taxonomic scope and, as\nsuch, the effects of many body shapes and designs on aquatic maneuverability\nand agility have yet to be examined. Turtles represent the oldest extant\nlineage of rigid-bodied vertebrates and the only aquatic rigid-bodied\ntetrapods. We evaluated the aquatic turning performance of painted turtles,\nChrysemys picta (Schneider, 1783) using the minimum length-specific\nradius of the turning path (R/L) and the average turning rate\n(ωavg) as measures of maneuverability and agility,\nrespectively. We filmed turtles conducting forward and backward turns in an\naquatic arena. Each type of turn was executed using a different pattern of\nlimb movements. During forward turns, turtles consistently protracted the\ninboard forelimb and held it stationary into the flow, while continuing to\nmove the outboard forelimb and both hindlimbs as in rectilinear swimming. The\nlimb movements of backward turns were more complex than those of forward\nturns, but involved near simultaneous retraction and protraction of\ncontralateral fore- and hindlimbs, respectively. Forward turns had a minimum\nR/L of 0.0018 (the second single lowest value reported from any\nanimal) and a maximum ωavg of 247.1°. Values of\nR/L for backward turns (0.0091-0.0950 L) were much less\nvariable than that of forward turns (0.0018-1.0442 L). The\nmaneuverability of turtles is similar to that recorded previously for\nrigidbodied boxfish. However, several morphological features of turtles (e.g.\nshell morphology and limb position) appear to increase agility relative to the\nbody design of boxfish."},{"title":"The interactive effects of hypoxia and nitric oxide on catecholamine\nsecretion in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/21/4214","abstract":"Experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that exposure of rainbow\ntrout to repetitive hypoxia would result in a decreased capacity of chromaffin\ncells to secrete catecholamines owing to increased production of nitric oxide\n(NO), a potent inhibitor of catecholamine secretion.

Using heterologous antibodies, nNOS and endothelial\nNOS (eNOS) were localized in close proximity to the chromaffin cells of the\nPCV.Exposure of trout to acute hypoxia (5.33 kPa for 30 min) in vivo\nresulted in significant increases in plasma catecholamine and NO levels.\nHowever, after 4 days of twice-daily exposures to hypoxia, the elevation of\nplasma catecholamine levels during hypoxia was markedly reduced. Associated\nwith the reduction in plasma catecholamine levels during acute hypoxia was a\nmarked increase in basal and hypoxia-evoked circulating levels of NO that\nbecame apparent after 2-4 days of repetitive hypoxia. The capacity of the\nchromaffin cells of the hypoxia-exposed fish to secrete catecholamine was\nassessed by electrical stimulation of an in situ saline-perfused PCV\npreparation. Compared with control (normoxic) fish, the PCV preparations\nderived from fish exposed to repeated hypoxia displayed a significant\nreduction in electrically evoked catecholamine secretion that was concomitant\nwith a marked increased in NO production. This additional rise in NO secretion\nin preparations derived from hypoxic fish was prevented after adding NOS\ninhibitors to the perfusate; concomitantly, the reduction in catecholamine\nsecretion was prevented. The increased production of NO during hypoxia in\nvivo and during electrical stimulation in situ was consistent\nwith significant elevations of nNOS mRNA and protein; eNOS protein was\nunaffected. These results suggest that the reduced capacity of trout\nchromaffin cells to secrete catecholamines after repeated hypoxia reflects an\nincrease in the expression of nNOS and a subsequent increase in NO production\nduring chromaffin-cell activation."},{"title":"Starvation drives a threshold triggering communication","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/21/4224","abstract":"The decision for an ant forager to launch recruitment is governed by an\ninternal response threshold.

In a behavioral prey selection paradigm, in which starved beetles\nwere presented moving prey-targets having different size, speed and elevation,\nthe beetles showed a strong preference for large targets when these were low\nin the visual field and a weaker preference for small targets when these were\nnear the horizon. Striking of targets above the horizon was reduced compared\nto sub-horizontal targets, and lacked the size-elevation interaction.

Together, they determine the\nduty factor (the fraction of the stride for which the limb maintains contact\nwith the ground surface), from which the peak vertical force can be estimated.\nWhen an animal changes speed, these variables change at different proportions.\nLimited measurements of these variables and predictions of peak limb force\nhave been undertaken for large mammals performing high-speed over-ground\nexercise. This study set out to make such measurements, employing a previously\nvalidated system consisting of limb-mounted accelerometers and a Global\nPositioning System data logger. Measurements were made on nine elite\nThoroughbred racehorses during gallop locomotion over a range of speeds from 9\nto 17 m s-1. No statistically significant differences were seen in\nany variables between the lead and non-lead limbs for either the fore or hind\npairs of limbs. Mean stance durations of 131 and 77 ms in the forelimbs and\n143 and 94 ms in the hindlimbs were recorded at speeds of 9 and 17\nms-1, respectively. Equivalent values for protraction duration were\n364 and 342 (fore) and 355 and 326 ms (hind). Peak limb forces (from duty\nfactor) at 17 ms-1 were 24.7 N kg-1 body weight (range\n22.6 to 26.0 N kg-1 body weight) for the forelimbs and 15.3 N\nkg-1 (range 13.7-16.2 N kg-1 body weight) for the\nhindlimbs. The duration of the aerial phase of the stride (when no limbs are\nin contact with the ground) was independent of speed.

Drinking\nrate decreased substantially at 12 h (32% of control value) and remained\nsuppressed after 3 and 7 days in fresh water (34 and 43%). By contrast, there\nwas a transient increase in the capacity for water absorption measured across\nisolated intestines in vitro (3.3- and 2.6-fold at 12 h and 3 days),\nwhich returned to baseline after 7 days. These changes in water absorption\ncould be entirely accounted for by changes in net ion flux: there was an\nextremely strong correlation (R2=0.960) between water\nabsorption and the sum of net Na+ and net Cl–\nfluxes (3.42±0.10 μl water μmol–1 ion). However,\nenhanced ion transport across the intestine in fresh water would probably not\nincrease water uptake in vivo, because the drinking rate was far less\nthan the capacity for water absorption across the intestine. The increased\nintestinal ion absorption after freshwater transfer may instead serve to\nfacilitate ion absorption from food when it is present in the gut. Modulation\nof net ion flux occurred without changes in mRNA levels of many ion\ntransporters (Na+/K+-ATPase α1a,\ncarbonic anhydrase 2, CFTR Cl– channel,\nNa+/K+/2Cl– cotransporter 2, and the\nsignalling protein 14-3-3a), and before a measured increase in\nNa+/K+-ATPase activity at 3 days, suggesting that there\nis some other mechanism responsible for increasing ion transport.\nInterestingly, net Cl– flux always exceeded net\nNa+ flux, possibly to help maintain Cl– balance\nand/or facilitate bicarbonate excretion.

For convenience, both the velocity of the centre of mass of the body\nat landing and take-off, and the characteristics of the muscle–tendon\nunits during stretching and recoil, are usually assumed to be the same. The\ndeviation from this symmetrical model has been determined here by measuring\nthe mechanical energy changes of the centre of mass of the body within the\nrunning step using a force platform. During the aerial phase the fall is\ngreater than the lift, and also in the absence of an aerial phase the\ntransduction between gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy is\ngreater during the downward displacement than during the lift. The peak of\nkinetic energy in the sagittal plane is attained thanks to gravity just prior\nto when the body starts to decelerate downwards during the negative work\nphase. In contrast, a lower peak of kinetic energy is attained, during the\npositive work phase, due to the muscular push continuing to accelerate the\nbody forwards after the end of the acceleration upwards. Up to a speed of 14\nkm h–1 the positive external work duration is greater than\nthe negative external work duration, suggesting a contribution of muscle\nfibres to the length change of the muscle–tendon units.

We\ncontrolled curvature by attaching rigid arc shapes of various radii to the\nbottoms of rigid boots restricting ankle motion. We measured mechanical work\nperformed on the center of mass (COM), and net metabolic rate, in human\nsubjects (N=10) walking with seven arc radii from 0.02–0.40 m.\nSimple models of dynamic walking predict that redirection of COM velocity\nrequires step-to-step transition work, decreasing quadratically with arc\nradius.

We measured the average rate of negative work performed on the COM, and\nfound that it followed the trend well (r2=0.95), with 2.37\ntimes as much work for small radii as for large. Net metabolic rate\n(subtracting quiet standing) also decreased with increasing arc radius to a\nminimum at 0.3 L, with a slight increase thereafter. Maximum net\nmetabolic rate was 6.25 W kg–1 (for small-radius arc feet),\nabout 59% greater than the minimum rate of 3.93 W kg–1, which\nin turn was about 45% greater than the rate in normal walking.

Not only do\ncosts increase as drag rises non-linearly with increasing speed, but speed\nalso affects travel time to foraging patches and therefore time and energy\nbudgets over the entire dive cycle. However, diving behaviour has rarely been\nconsidered in relation to current velocity. Strong tidal currents around the\nBelcher Islands, Nunavut, Canada, produce polynyas, persistent areas of open\nwater in the sea ice which are important habitats for wildlife wintering in\nHudson Bay. Some populations of common eiders Somateria mollissima\nsedentaria remain in polynyas through the winter where they dive to\nforage on benthic invertebrates. Strong tidal currents keep polynyas from\nfreezing, but current velocity can exceed 1.5 m s–1 and could\ninfluence time and energy costs of diving and foraging. Polynyas therefore\nprovide naturally occurring flume tanks allowing investigation of diving\nstrategies of free ranging birds in relation to current velocity. We used a\ncustom designed sub-sea ice camera to non-invasively investigate over 150\ndives to a depth of 11.3 m by a population of approximately 100 common eiders\nat Ulutsatuq polynya during February and March of 2002 and 2003. Current speed\nduring recorded dives ranged from 0 to 1 m s–1. As currents\nincreased, vertical descent speed of eiders decreased, while descent duration\nand the number of wing strokes and foot strokes during descent to the bottom\nincreased. However, nearly simultaneous strokes of wings and feet, and swim\nspeed relative to the moving water, were maintained within a narrow range\n(2.28±0.23 Hz; 1.25±0.14 m s–1, respectively).\nThis close regulation of swim speed over a range in current speed of 1.0 m\ns–1 might correspond to efficient muscle contraction rates,\nand probably reduces work rates by avoiding rapidly increasing drag at greater\nspeeds; however, it also increases travel time to benthic foraging patches.\nDespite regulation of average swim speed, high instantaneous speeds during\noscillatory stroking can increase dive costs due to drag. While most diving\nbirds have been considered either foot or wing propelled, eider ducks used\nboth wing and foot propulsion during descent. Our observations indicate that\nthe power phase of foot strokes coincides with the transition between upstroke\nand downstroke of the wings, when drag is greatest. Coordinated timing between\nfoot and wing propulsion could therefore serve to maintain a steadier speed\nduring descent and decrease the costs of diving. Despite tight regulation of\nstroke and swim speed patterns, descent duration and total number of foot and\nwing strokes during descent increase non-linearly with increasing current\nvelocity, suggesting an increase in energetic costs of diving."},{"title":"Interspecific variation in beeswax as a biological construction material","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/20/3984","abstract":"Beeswax is a multicomponent material used by bees in the genus\nApis to house larvae and store honey and pollen.

It was hypothesized that the forelimb would do net negative\nwork while the hindlimb did net positive work during trotting in the horse.\nBecause vertical and horizontal impulses remain unchanged across speeds it was\nhypothesized that net work of both limbs would be independent of speed.\nAdditionally because the major mass of limb musculature is located proximally,\nit was hypothesized that proximal joints would do more work than distal\njoints.

The zero net work of the forelimb may be the consequence of our not\nbeing able to account, experimentally, for the negative work done by the\nextrinsic muscles connecting the scapula and the thorax. The distal three\njoints of both limbs behaved elastically with a period of energy absorption\nfollowed by energy return.

Despite the prevalence of complex flows in nature, almost\nnothing is known about the function of the lateral line and its relationship\nto other sensory modalities for freely swimming fishes in turbulent flows.\nPast studies indicate that under certain conditions the lateral line is not\nneeded to swim steadily in uniform flow. This paper examines how the lateral\nline and vision affect body kinematics and hydrodynamic habitat selection of\nrainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to vortices generated\nbehind a cylinder. Trout Kármán gaiting (i.e. exploiting\nvortices to hold station in a vortex street) with a pharmacologically blocked\nlateral line display altered kinematics; body wavelength and wave speed\nincrease compared to control animals. When visual cues are withheld by\nperforming experiments in the dark, almost all Kármán gait\nkinematics measured for fish with and without a functional lateral line are\nthe same. The lateral line, rather than vision, plays a larger role in\naffecting body kinematics when trout hold station in a vortex street. Trout\nshow a preference to Kármán gait in the light but not in the\ndark, which may be attributed to physiological state rather than hydrodynamic\nor sensorimotor reasons. In the dark, trout both with and without a functional\nlateral line hold station near the downstream suction region of the cylinder\nwake (i.e. entraining) and avoid the vortex street. Vision therefore plays a\nlarger role in the preference to associate with a turbulent vortex\nstreet.

Changes in relative proportions of\nmajor molecular species of glycerophosphoethanolamines (GPEtns) and\nglycerophosphocholines (GPChols) in thoracic muscle and fat body tissues were\nfollowed using HPLC coupled to electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. The\nincrease in relative proportion of 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleyl-sn-GPEtn at\nthe expense of 1,2-dilinoleyl-sn-GPChol was the most prominent\nfeature of the complex change observed in both tissues during autumnal\nacclimatization in the field.

A similar\nrestructuring response was seen during acclimatization in the field and cold\nacclimation in the laboratory.

We measured foraging times, nectar loads collected, and\nCO2 production during actual feeding, as an indication of the\nenergy expenditure for a single forager. Results show an increase in\nindividual metabolic rates with increasing flow rate of sugar solution, but no\ndependence on sucrose concentration. This increase in metabolic expenditure\ndoes not depend on the crop load attained while feeding, as intuitively\nexpected, and is therefore a result of an increased activity brought about by\nthe food-source profitability experienced by the forager. The energy gained\nduring collection of sugar solution is always higher than the energy spent by\nthe ant. Even with a food source of lower quality than a natural source, the\nants gain ca. tenfold of what they spend. Based on a simplified\nmodel, we calculated that foragers of C. rufipes could travel from\n0.5 to 9 km with the energy gained in a single foraging trip only. These\nresults suggest that decreasing foraging time is more important than\nincreasing individual energetic efficiency when workers of the nectar-feeding\nant C. rufipes decide to stop drinking and return to the nest with\npartial crop loads."},{"title":"Tuning the drum: the mechanical basis for frequency discrimination in a Mediterranean cicada","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/20/4115","abstract":"Cicadas are known to use sound to find a mate. While the mechanism employed\nby male cicadas to generate loud calling songs has been described in detail,\nlittle information exists to explain how their ears work. Using microscanning\nlaser Doppler vibrometry, the tympanal vibrations in the cicada Cicadatra\natra are measured in response to acoustic playbacks. The topographically\naccurate optical measurements reveal the vibrational behaviour of the\nanatomically complex tympanal membrane. Notably, the tympanal ridge, a\ndistinct structural element of the tympanum that is a link to the receptor\ncells, undergoes mechanical vibrations reminiscent of a travelling wave. In\neffect, the frequency for which the maximum deflection amplitude is observed\nregularly decreases from the apex to the base of the ridge. It is also shown\nthat whilst female ears are mechanically tuned to the male's song, the male's\ntympanum is only partially tuned to its own song. This study establishes the\npresence of a peripheral auditory mechanism that can potentially process\nauditory frequency analysis. In view of the importance of acoustic signalling\nin cicadas, this unconventional tympanal mechanism may be employed in the\ncontext of species recognition and sexual selection."},{"title":"The variable colours of the fiddler crab Uca vomeris and their\nrelation to background and predation","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/20/4140","abstract":"Colour changes in fiddler crabs have long been noted, but a functional\ninterpretation is still lacking.

To this end, we trained gray short-tailed opossums\n(Monodelphis domestica) to move along level, 30° inclined, and\n30° declined trackways instrumented with a force platform. Vertical,\ncraniocaudal and mediolateral impulses, peak vertical forces, and required\ncoefficient of friction (μreq) of individual limbs were\ncalculated. Two high speed video cameras were used to simultaneously capture\nwhole limb craniocaudal and mediolateral angles at limb touchdown, midstance\nand lift-off. Patterns on the level terrain were typical for non-primate\nquadrupeds: the forelimbs supported the majority of the body weight, forelimbs\nwere net braking and hindlimbs net propulsive, and both limb pairs exerted\nsmall laterally directed impulses. M. domestica moved more slowly on\nsloped substrates in comparison to level locomotion, and exhibited a greaterμ\nreq.

Thus, the study on S. marmoratus was undertaken to\ninvestigate how stroke volume and venous function are affected during\nair-breathing. To this end we measured cardiac output\n(Q̇), heart rate\n(fH), central venous blood pressure\n(PCV), mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP), and\ndorsal aortic blood pressures (PDA) in S.\nmarmoratus.

In\nterrestrial vertebrates, limb gaits have been extensively studied in diverse\ntaxa and gait transitions have been shown to provide efficient locomotion\nacross a wide range of speeds. In contrast, examination of gaits in fishes has\nfocused on axial gaits and the transition between synchronous paired fin\nlocomotion and axial propulsion. Because many fishes use their pectoral fins\nas their primary propulsors, we aimed to examine more broadly the use of\npectoral fin gaits in locomotion. We used juvenile reef fishes in these\nexperiments because their swimming could be recorded readily across a wide\nrange of Reynolds numbers, which we thought would promote gait diversity.\nBased on previous work in larval fishes, we hypothesized that juveniles have\nalternating pectoral fin movements rather than the synchronous, or in-phase,\ncoordination pattern of adults. In flow tank swim studies, we found that\njuvenile sapphire damselfish Pomacentrus pavo used two fin gaits\nduring steady swimming. Below approximately 3 BL s-1,\nP. pavo primarily swam with alternating fin strokes 180° out of\nphase with one another. At speeds in the range of 3-4 BL\ns-1, they performed a gait transition to synchronous fin\ncoordination. Between approximately 4 and 8 BL s-1, P.\npavo primarily beat their fins synchronously. At around 8 BL\ns-1 there was another gait transition to body-caudal fin swimming,\nin which the pectoral fins were tucked against the body.

To determine whether this\ngait transition was species-specific, we surveyed pectoral fin locomotion in\njuveniles from 11 species in three reef fish families (Pomacentridae, Labridae\nand Scaridae).

The\npresent study investigated how an osmoconforming decapod, the graceful crab\nCancer gracilis, balanced the demands of physiological systems\n(prioritization or additivity of events) during feeding and digestion in a low\nsalinity environment. Cancer gracilis exhibited a typical increase in\noxygen uptake and less pronounced increases in cardiovascular variables (heart\nrate, stroke volume, cardiac output) during feeding in 100% seawater. In 3-day\nstarved crabs, exposure to 65% seawater resulted in a pronounced bradycardia,\nwith a concomitant decrease in cardiac output and haemolymph flow rates and a\ntemporary decrease in oxygen uptake. When crabs were exposed to low salinity,\n3 h and 24 h after food ingestion, heart rate increased slightly and cardiac\noutput and ventilation rates remained stable. Although oxygen uptake decreased\ntransiently, feeding levels were quickly regained. During a recovery phase in\n100%SW there was an overshoot in parameters, suggesting repayment of an oxygen\ndebt. Thus, it appears that feeding and digestion are prioritized in this\nspecies, allowing it to survive acute exposure to hyposaline water.\nFurthermore, the results show that the nutritional state of an animal is\nimportant in modulating its physiological responses to environmental\nperturbations.

We analyzed the locomotor\nkinematics of over 2400 strides from 14 African and 48 Asian elephant\nindividuals (body mass 116-4632 kg) freely moving over ground at a 17-fold\nrange of speeds, from slow walking at 0.40 m s-1 to the fastest\nreliably recorded speed for elephants, 6.8 m s-1. These data reveal\nthat African and Asian elephants have some subtle differences in how\nsize-independent kinematic parameters change with speed. Although elephants\nuse a lateral sequence footfall pattern, like many other quadrupeds, they\nmaintain this footfall pattern at all speeds, shifting toward a 25% phase\noffset between limbs (singlefoot) as they increase speed. The duty factors of\nelephants are greater for the forelimbs than for the hindlimbs, so an aerial\nphase for the hindquarters is reached at slower speeds than for the\nforequarters. This aerial phase occurs at a Froude number of around 1,\nmatching theoretical predictions. At faster speeds, stance and swing phase\ndurations approach asymptotes, with the duty factor beginning to level off,\nconcurrent with an increase in limb compliance that likely keeps peak forces\nrelatively low. This increase of limb compliance is reflected by increased\ncompression of the hindlimbs. Like other tetrapods, smaller elephants are\nrelatively more athletic than larger ones, but still move very similarly to\nadults even at <500 kg. At any particular speed they adopt greater relative\nstride frequencies and relative stride lengths compared to larger elephants.\nThis extends to near-maximal locomotor performance as well - smaller elephants\nreach greater Froude numbers and smaller duty factors, hence likely reach\nrelatively greater peak loads on their limbs and produce this force more\nrapidly. A variety of lines of kinematic evidence support the inference that\nelephants change their mechanics near a Froude number of 1 (if not at slower\nspeeds), at least to using more compliant limbs, if not spring-like whole-body\nkinetics. In some ways, elephants move similarly to many other quadrupeds,\nsuch as increasing speed mainly by increasing stride frequency (except at fast\nspeeds), and they match scaling predictions for many stride parameters. The\nmain difference from most other animals is that elephants never change their\nfootfall pattern to a gait that uses a whole-body aerial phase. Our large\ndataset establishes what the normal kinematics of elephant locomotion are, and\ncan also be applied to identify gait abnormalities that may signal\nmusculoskeletal pathologies, a matter of great importance to keepers of\ncaptive elephants."},{"title":"Growth or differentiation?

Our experiments on\nthe dynamics of arm regeneration in A. filiformis revealed that the\ndevelopmental program during regeneration is well adapted to its burrowing\nlife style. We demonstrate that there is a trade-off between regeneration in\nlength and functional recovery for feeding (differentiation index). The amount\nof tissue lost (length lost), which represents the quantity of tissue needed\nto completely regenerate an intact arm with no previous history of\nregeneration, determines whether the arm will invest more energy in growth\nand/or in differentiation, which must be a reflection of the ability to\ndifferentially regulate developmental programs during regeneration. We show\nthat combining regeneration rate with differentiation index provides an ideal\ntool for the definition of a standard temporal framework for both field and\nlaboratory studies of regeneration."},{"title":"Effects of long-term hypoxia on enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism in the\nGulf killifish, Fundulus grandis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/19/3851","abstract":"The goal of the current study was to generate a comprehensive, multi-tissue\nperspective of the effects of chronic hypoxic exposure on carbohydrate\nmetabolism in the Gulf killifish Fundulus grandis.

The specific activities of enzymes of glycolysis and glycogen\nmetabolism were strongly suppressed by hypoxia in white skeletal muscle, which\nmay reflect decreased energy demand in this tissue during chronic hypoxia. In\ncontrast, several enzyme specific activities were higher in liver tissue after\nhypoxic exposure, suggesting increased capacity for carbohydrate metabolism.\nHypoxic exposure affected fewer enzymes in heart and brain than in skeletal\nmuscle and liver, and the changes were smaller in magnitude, perhaps due to\npreferential perfusion of heart and brain during hypoxia. The specific\nactivities of some gluconeogenic enzymes increased in liver during long-term\nhypoxic exposure, which may be coupled to increased protein catabolism in\nskeletal muscle. These results demonstrate that when intact fish are subjected\nto prolonged hypoxia, enzyme activities respond in a tissue-specific fashion\nreflecting the balance of energetic demands, metabolic role and oxygen supply\nof particular tissues. Furthermore, within glycolysis, the effects of hypoxia\nvaried among enzymes, rather than being uniformly distributed among pathway\nenzymes."},{"title":"Laboratory behavioural assay of insect magnetoreception:\nmagnetosensitivity of Periplaneta americana","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/19/3882","abstract":"A relatively simple all-laboratory behavioural assay of insect\nmagnetoreception has been developed.

We examined the external\nanatomy and physiological capabilities of a head posture proprioceptor, the\nprosternal organ (PO), located at the base of the neck in the black soldier\nfly, Hermetia illucens (L.) (Family: Stratiomyidae). The PO is\nsexually isomorphic and is composed of two fused plates of about 130\nmechanosensory hairs set in asymmetrical sockets whose orientation varies\nacross the organ. A multi-joint mechanical coupling between the head, neck\nmembrane, and contact sclerites deflects the hairs more or less to increase or\ndecrease their level of excitation. The PO sensory afferents project to the\ncentral nervous system (CNS) via a pair of bilateral prosternal\nnerves (PN) to the fused thoracic ganglia. Simultaneous recording of spiking\nactivity in the PN and videotaping of wind-induced and voluntary head\nmovements around all three axes of head rotation reveal that a few PN\nafferents are active at rest, but activity increases tonically in response to\nhead deflections. Activity is significantly modulated by change in head angles\naround the pitch (±40°), yaw (±30°) and roll (more than±\n90°) axes, although the dynamic range of spiking activity differs\nfor each axis of rotation. Prosternal nerve afferents are bilaterally excited\n(inhibited) by pitch down (up); excited (inhibited) by head yaw toward the\nipsilateral (contralateral) side; excited by roll down toward the ipsilateral\nside, but little inhibited by roll toward the opposite side. Although\nbilateral comparison of activity in PN afferents reliably encodes head posture\naround a given rotational axis, from the point of view of the CNS, the problem\nof encoding head posture is ill-posed with three axes of rotation and only two\nstreams of afferent information. Furthermore, when the head is rotated around\nmore than one axis simultaneously, mechanical interactions in the neck modify\nthe responses to postural changes around the three rotational axes, which adds\nfurther ambiguity to reliable encoding of head posture.

Intervertebral\njoint movements were studied in two metatherian and three eutherian species\nduring the gallop and halfbound using high-speed cineradiography. Fast-Fourier\ntransformation was used to filter out high frequency digitizing errors and\nkeep the lower frequency sinusoid oscillations that characterize the\nintervertebral angular movements. Independent of their regional classification\nas thoracic or lumbar vertebrae, 7±1 presacral intervertebral joints\nwere involved in sagittal bending movements. In only one species, no more than\nfive intervertebral joints contributed to the resulting `pelvic movement'. In\ngeneral, the trunk region involved in sagittal bending during locomotion did\nnot correspond to the traditional subdivisions of the vertebral column (e.g.\nas thoracic and lumbar or pre- and postdiaphragmatic region). Therefore, these\nclassifications do not predict the regions involved in spinal oscillations\nduring locomotion. Independent of the gait, maximum flexion of the spine was\nobserved in the interval between the last third of the swing phase and\ntouch-down. This results in a retraction of the pelvis and hindlimbs before\ntouch-down and, we hypothesize, enhances the stability of the system. Maximum\nextension occurred during the first third of the swing phase (i.e. after\nlift-off) in all species. In general, the observed timing of dorsoventral\noscillations of the spine are in accordance with that observed in other\nmammals and with activity data of respiratory and epaxial back muscles.\nAlthough no strict craniocaudal pattern was observable, the more cranial\nintervertebral joints tend to flex and extend earlier than the more caudal\nones. This is in accordance with the organization and the activation of the\nparavertebral musculature in mammals. The amplitude of intervertebral joint\nmovements increased caudally, reaching its highest values in the presacral\njoint. The more intense sagittal bending movements in the caudal\nintervertebral joints are reflected by the muscle fiber type composition of\nthe back muscles involved.

The fictive lung ventilation\nfrequency response to NA application was both dose- and stage-dependent.\nAlthough no net change was observed in the pre-metamorphic group, NA\napplication decreased fictive lung burst frequency in preparations from more\nmature animals. These effects were attenuated by application ofα\n-adrenoceptor antagonists. Conversely, NA application elicited dose-\nand stage-dependent increases in fictive buccal ventilation frequency. We then\nassessed the contribution of α-adrenoceptors towards these responses by\napplying specific agonists (α1: phenylephrine;α\n2: clonidine; concentration range from 10 to 200 μmol\nl-1 for both). Of the two agonists used, only phenylephrine\napplication consistently mimicked the lung burst frequency response observed\nduring NA application in each stage group. However, both agonists decreased\nbuccal burst frequency, thus suggesting that other (β) adrenoceptor types\nmediate this response. We conclude that modulation of both buccal and\nlung-related motor outputs change during development. NA modulation affects\nboth types of respiratory activities in a distinct fashion, owing to the\ndifferent adrenoceptor type involved."},{"title":"Actions of kinin peptides in the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab\nCancer borealis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/18/3664","abstract":"To fully understand neuronal network operation, the influence of all inputs\nonto that network must be characterized. As in most systems, many neuronal and\nhormonal pathways influence the multifunctional motor circuits of the\ncrustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG), but the actions of only some of them\nare known. Therefore, we characterized the influence of the kinin peptide\nfamily on the gastric mill (chewing) and pyloric (filtering of chewed food)\nmotor circuits in the STG of the crab Cancer borealis. The kinins are\nmyoactive in arthropods and they occur within the arthropod central nervous\nsystem (CNS), but their CNS actions are not well characterized in any species.\nThe pevkinins were first identified in the shrimp Penaeus vannamei,\nbut they have yet to be studied in the STG of any species. We identified\nkinin-like immunolabeling (KLI) in the pericardial organs (POs) in C.\nborealis, but there was no KLI within the STG. The POs are a major source\nof hormonal influence on the STG. Pevkinin peptides activated the pyloric\ncircuit and they caused a modest increase in the speed of ongoing pyloric\nrhythms. This modest influence on cycle speed resulted in part from pevkinin\nexcitation of the lateral pyloric neuron, whose strengthened inhibitory\nsynapse onto the pyloric pacemaker neurons limited the pevkinin-mediated\nincrease in cycle speed. The pevkinin excitation of the pyloric rhythm was not\nstrong enough to interfere with the previously documented, gastric mill\nrhythm-mediated weakening of the pyloric rhythm. Pevkinin also had little\ninfluence on the gastric mill rhythm. These results indicate that the kinin\npeptides have distinct and selective modulatory actions on the pyloric\nrhythm."},{"title":"Perturbation of auditory feedback causes systematic perturbation in vocal structure in adult cotton-top tamarins","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/18/3652","abstract":"Auditory feedback is critical for the development and maintenance of speech\nin humans.

In addition we recorded calls before and\nafter the experimental series (Baseline condition) to determine whether any\nchanges induced by modification of auditory feedback persisted. Results showed\nthat playback of white noise during the production of the CLC produced changes\nin the temporal structure of the CLC: calls were shorter and had fewer pulses,\nindicating that modification of auditory feedback can interrupt vocal\nproduction. In addition, calls that received modified feedback were louder and\nhad longer inter-pulse intervals than those that did not, consistent with an\nadaptive response to the masking effect of white noise playback. The magnitude\nof this compensatory effect and the interruption rate were both sensitive to\nwhether the feedback modification occurred at the beginning or end of the\nexperimental session: early feedback produced less interruption and more\ncompensation. Finally, when auditory feedback modification was unpredictable,\nadaptive changes were observed in both calls that received modified feedback\nand those that received normal feedback, suggesting that tamarins can generate\nan expectation of noise playback and increase vocal amplitude in anticipation\nof masking."},{"title":"Energetic influence on gull flight strategy selection","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/18/3489","abstract":"During non-migratory flight, gulls (Larids) use a wide variety of flight\nstrategies.

We\nwere interested in knowing whether these environmental factors could\ndevelopmentally shift Amargosa River pupfish toward the morphology typical of\npupfish in Devil's Hole. By regulating food ration, we created groups of\npupfish with low, medium and high growth rates. Pupfish with low growth showed\nproportionally larger head and eyes, smaller body depth, and reduction in\npelvic fin development. Elevated temperature further inhibited pelvic fin\ndevelopment in all treatments. Pupfish in the low growth group also showed\nreduced levels of thyroid hormone, suggesting a possible physiological\nmechanism underlying these morphological changes. To test this mechanism\nfurther, pupfish were reared with goitrogens to pharmacologically inhibit\nendogenous thyroid hormone production.

Geckos are\neasily and rapidly able to detach their toes as they climb. There are two\nknown mechanisms of detachment: (1) on the microscale, the seta detaches when\nthe shaft reaches a critical angle with the substrate, and (2) on the\nmacroscale, geckos hyperextend their toes, apparently peeling like tape. This\nraises the question of how geckos prevent detachment while inverted on the\nceiling, where body weight should cause toes to peel and setal angles to\nincrease. Geckos use opposing feet and toes while inverted, possibly to\nmaintain shear forces that prevent detachment of setae or peeling of toes. If\ndetachment occurs by macroscale peeling of toes, the peel angle should\nmonotonically decrease with applied force. In contrast, if adhesive force is\nlimited by microscale detachment of setae at a critical angle, the toe\ndetachment angle should be independent of applied force. We tested the\nhypothesis that adhesion is increased by shear force in isolated setal arrays\nand live gecko toes. We also tested the corollary hypotheses that (1) adhesion\nin toes and arrays is limited as on the microscale by a critical angle, or (2)\non the macroscale by adhesive strength as predicted for adhesive tapes. We\nfound that adhesion depended directly on shear force, and was independent of\ndetachment angle. Therefore we reject the hypothesis that gecko toes peel like\ntape. The linear relation between adhesion and shear force is consistent with\na critical angle of release in live gecko toes and isolated setal arrays, and\nalso with our prior observations of single setae. We introduced a new model,\nfrictional adhesion, for gecko pad attachment and compared it to existing\nmodels of adhesive contacts. In an analysis of clinging stability of a gecko\non an inclined plane each adhesive model predicted a different force control\nstrategy. The frictional adhesion model provides an explanation for the very\nlow detachment forces observed in climbing geckos that does not depend on toe\npeeling."},{"title":"Uncertainty about nest position influences systematic search strategies in desert ants","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/18/3545","abstract":"Foraging desert ants return to their starting point, the nest, by means of\npath integration.

Here, we present the identification of sodium/proton\nexchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) from yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti\n(AeNHE3). AeNHE3 localizes to the basal plasma membrane of\nMalpighian tubule, midgut and the ion-transporting sector of gastric caeca.\nMidgut expression of NHE3 shows a different pattern of enrichment between\nlarval and adult stages, implicating it in the maintenance of regional pH in\nthe midgut during the life cycle. In all tissues examined, NHE3 predominantly\nlocalizes to the basal membrane. In addition the limited expression in\nintracellular vesicles in the median Malpighian tubules may reflect a\npotential functional versatility of NHE3 in a tissue-specific manner. The\nlocalization of V-ATPase and NHE3, and exclusion of\nNa+/K+-ATPase from the distal ion-transporting sector of\ncaeca, indicate that the role of NHE3 in ion and pH regulation is intricately\nassociated with functions of V-ATPase. The AeNHE3 complements yeast\nmutants deficient in yeast NHEs, NHA1 and NHX1. To further examine the\nfunctional property of AeNHE3, we expressed it in NHE-deficient\nfibroblast cells. AeNHE3 expressing cells were capable of recovering\nintracellular pH following an acid load. The recovery was independent of the\nlarge cytoplasmic region of AeNHE3, implying this domain to be\ndispensable for NHE3 ion transport function. 22Na+\nuptake studies indicated that AeNHE3 is relatively insensitive to\namiloride and EIPA and is capable of Na+ transport in the absence\nof the cytoplasmic tail. Thus, the core domain containing the transmembrane\nregions of NHE3 is sufficient for pH recovery and ion transport. The present\ndata facilitate refinement of the prevailing models of insect epithelial\ntransport by incorporating basal amiloride-insensitive NHE3 as a critical\nmediator of transepithelial ion and fluid transport and likely in the\nmaintenance of intracellular pH."},{"title":"Correlation between thermotolerance and membrane properties in\nParamecium aurelia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/18/3580","abstract":"The relationship between thermotolerance and membrane properties was\nstudied by using a ciliated protozoan, Paramecium aurelia.

Performance values derived from these\ncoordinates were used to describe take-off in C. paradisi, compare\nmodes of take-off, and make predictions about the ecological use of take-off\nin the wild. Four types of take-off were identified. In most observed\ntake-offs, snakes used a vertically looped take-off (termed `anchored J-loop'\nand `sliding J-loop'), which represent the only true jumping in snakes. In an\nanchored J-loop take-off, the snake formed an anterior hanging loop and then\njumped by holding the posterior body static on the branch and accelerating up\nand away from the branch. This was the most commonly used take-off mode. A\nsliding J-loop take-off was similar but occurred with the entire body in\nmotion. Snakes using such take-offs lowered less of their body below the\nbranch than in an anchored J-loop take-off, resulting in shorter preparation\nand vertical acceleration durations and producing a lower maximum vertical\nvelocity.

Above 24°C SMR and AMR levelled off and MS tended to decrease.\nWe found a tight relationship between AMR and Umax and\nobserved that raising the temperature increased AMR and increased swimming\nability. However, although fish swam faster at high temperature, the net cost\nof transport (COTnet) at a given speed was not influence by the\nelevation of the water temperature. Although Uopt doubled\nbetween 7°C and 30°C (from 0.3 to 0.6 m s-1), metabolic\nrate at Uopt represented a relatively constant fraction of\nthe animal active metabolic rate (40-45%). A proposed model integrates the\neffects of water temperature on the interaction between metabolism and\nswimming performance. In particular the controlling effect of temperature on\nAMR is shown to be the key factor limiting maximal swimming speed of sea\nbass."},{"title":"Associations between tissue fatty acid composition and physiological\ntraits of performance and metabolism in the seabass (Dicentrarchus\nlabrax)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/17/3429","abstract":"Seabass were fed for 4 months with diets where the lipid was provided as\neither canola oil (CO), palm oil (PO) or fish oil (FO), to generate diversity\nin their tissue fatty acid (FA) composition and investigate how this\ninfluenced major traits of exercise performance, cardiac performance and\nrespiratory metabolism.

The improved swimming performance in the CO and PO\ngroups was accompanied by a higher maximum cardiac output\n(Q̇) and net cardiac scope, and a higher\nactive metabolic rate (AMR) and aerobic scope (AS) than in the FO group.\nAnalysis of tissue FA composition revealed that the fish fed the CO and PO\ndiets had accumulated significantly higher levels of OA and LA in their heart\nand muscle than the fish from the FO group, which had significantly higher\nlevels of highly unsaturated FA of the n-3 series, such as EPA and DHA\n(20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, respectively).

We have investigated how these two\nnecessary pieces of information interact within the path integration\nprocessor. The specific question is: how do the ants process distance\ninformation if there is no simultaneous input from the sky compass available.\nAnts were trained to forage in a `Z'-shaped channel system, the three segments\nof which joined at right angles. Individual animals were transferred from the\nfeeder to a test field where their homing paths could be observed. In the\ncrucial tests the middle segment of the maze was covered by orange Perspex\nthat did not transmit the UV part of the spectrum, and thus precluded the\nperception of polarization patterns. Changes of the ant's processing of\nodometric information within this channel segment directly translate into a\nchange in homing direction on the test field.

Large species are capable\nof eating larger seeds and are able to husk large seeds faster than smaller\nspecies. It is generally assumed that husking time is related to bite force.\nHowever, there are very few studies that investigate the relationship between\nhusking time, seed hardness and bite force directly.In our experiments we measured the seed husking time and the maximal bite\nforce of two taxa of seed cracking birds. Husking time is related to maximal\nbite force in a highly non-linear way and differs between estrildids and\nfringillids. Fringillids with the same bite force as estrildids take less time\nto crack seeds, but only when the strength of the seed coat is close to their\nmaximal bite force. For seeds that are relatively soft the difference in\nhusking time becomes very small. A preliminary jaw motion analysis provides\nevidence that this difference in husking time between estrildids and\nfringillids is paralleled by a difference in husking technique. This\ndifference in technique does not affect bite force as such, but decreases the\nchance of failed cracking attempts.The selective advantage of a small increase in maximal bite force may be\nrelated more to the decrease in husking time for seeds with hardness below the\nmaximal bite force, than to the increase in range of seed hardness that the\nbird is able to crack."},{"title":"Body density affects stroke patterns in Baikal seals","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/17/3269","abstract":"Buoyancy is one of the primary external forces acting on air-breathing\ndivers and it can affect their swimming energetics.

To test this\nprediction, we attached acceleration data loggers to four free-ranging Baikal\nseals Phoca sibirica in Lake Baikal and monitored flipper stroking\nactivity as well as swimming speed, depth and inclination of the body axis\n(pitch). In addition to the logger, one seal (Individual 4) was equipped with\na lead weight that was jettisoned after a predetermined time period so that we\nhad a set of observations on the same individual with different body\ndensities. These four data sets revealed the general diving patterns of Baikal\nseals and also provided direct insights into the influence of buoyancy on\nthese patterns. Seals repeatedly performed dives of a mean duration of 7.0 min\n(max. 15.4 min), interrupted by a mean surface duration of 1.2 min. Dive\ndepths were 66 m on average, but varied substantially, with a maximum depth of\n324 m. The seals showed different stroke patterns among individuals; some\nseals stroked at lower rates during descent than ascent, while the others had\nhigher stroke rates during descent than ascent. When the lead weight was\ndetached from Individual 4, the seal increased its stroke rate in descent by\nshifting swimming mode from prolonged glides to more stroke-and-glide\nswimming, and decreased its stroke rate in ascent by shifting from continuous\nstroking to stroke-and-glide swimming. We conclude that seals adopt different\nstroke patterns according to their individual buoyancies. We also demonstrate\nthat the terminal speed reached by Individual 4 during prolonged glide in\ndescent depended on its total buoyancy and pitch, with higher speeds reached\nin the weighted condition and at steeper pitch. A simple physical model\nallowed us to estimate the body density of the seal from the speed and pitch\n(1027-1046 kg m-3, roughly corresponding to 32-41% lipid content,\nfor the weighted condition; 1014-1022 kg m-3, 43-47% lipid content,\nfor the unweighted condition)."},{"title":"The pressures of suction feeding: the relation between buccal pressure and induced fluid speed in centrarchid fishes","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/17/3281","abstract":"Suction feeding fish rapidly expand their oral cavity, resulting in a flow\nof water directed towards the mouth that is accompanied by a drop in pressure\ninside the buccal cavity.

Animals are isolated in a\nclosed chamber of a known volume and equilibrated with a helium:oxygen gas\nmixture. The chamber is then rapidly flushed with a nitrogen:oxygen gas\nmixture to eliminate the helium surrounding the animal, and sealed. After a\nperiod of time sufficient to allow equilibration of helium between tracheal\nsystem and chamber air, a gas sample is taken from the chamber, and tracheal\nvolumes are calculated from the helium content of the sample, using a gas\nchromatograph. We show that relative investment in the tracheal system\nincreases with age/size in the grasshopper; tracheal volume scales with mass\nto the power 1.3. This increased proportional investment in the tracheal\nsystem provides a mechanistic basis for the enhanced respiratory capacity of\nolder grasshoppers. Tracheal volumes decrease strongly as grasshoppers grow\nwithin an instar stage, explaining reduced safety margins for oxygen delivery.\nFinally, tracheal volumes are smaller in gravid females than males, probably\ndue to compression of air sacs by eggs."},{"title":"Molecular characterization of the first aromatic nutrient transporter from the sodium neurotransmitter symporter family","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/16/3183","abstract":"Nutrient amino acid transporters (NATs, subfamily of sodium\nneurotransmitter symporter family SNF, a.k.a.

These behavioral strategies are collectively termed\nsickness behaviors and are hypothesized to divert energy away from normal\nactivities to combat and overcome infection. Sickness behavior can be\ntriggered experimentally by injecting bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In\nthis study, we provide the first evidence for seasonal modulation of sickness\nbehavior in a free-living animal. Male song sparrows of western Washington\nstate (Melospiza melodia morphna) are sedentary and territorial year\nround, except for a brief time during molt.

Recaptured LPS males in the winter lost more body mass than\nsaline-injected controls while LPS males in the spring did not. These data\nindicate that birds in breeding condition were relatively insensitive to the\neffects of LPS. On a proximate level, suppression of sickness behavior during\nbreeding is likely mediated by seasonal differences in energy allocation, as\nwintering sparrows were significantly heavier and had larger subcutaneous fat\nreserves and lower baseline corticosterone levels than breeding birds.\nUltimately, suppression of sickness behavior may represent an allocation\nstrategy to balance current reproductive opportunities with the life-history\ncosts of self-defense."},{"title":"Effect of parental age and associated size on fecundity, growth and\nsurvival in the yellow seahorse Hippocampus kuda","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/16/3055","abstract":"Seahorses, together with the pipefishes (Family Syngnathidae), are the only\nvertebrates in which embryonic development takes place within a specialised\nbody compartment, the brood pouch, of the male instead of the female.

Several studies have shown that\nimproved cold endurance is accompanied by increases in summit metabolic rate\n(Msum), a measure of maximal heat production and an\nindicator of the level of sustainable thermogenic capacity. However, improved\nendurance to cold can also be achieved without significant changes in\nMsum. The same is true for basal metabolic rate (BMR),\nwhich is known to increase in association with cold acclimatization or\nacclimation in some species but not in others. We investigated cold\nacclimation in a migrant shorebird known for extreme physiological\nflexibility, the red knot (Calidris canutus, the northerly wintering\nsubspecies islandica). We measured BMR and Msum\nover two months in birds caught in the wild and transferred to experimentally\ncontrolled conditions representative of aspects of their seasonal thermal\nenvironment (two groups at constant 25°C, one group at constant 4°C\nand two groups experiencing variable outdoor temperatures).

These results, together with data on alimentary tract size\nand pectoral muscle thickness measured by ultrasonography, suggest that red\nknots acclimate to cold primarily through modulation of (lean) body mass\ncomponents. Heavier individuals have larger muscles, which allow higher\nmaximal heat production and better thermal compensation. Cold acclimation\neffects on BMR are most probably due to changes in the size of visceral\norgans, although not the alimentary tract in this specific case.

However, because the fictive\nturns in rigidly tethered flies follow a much longer time course, the extent\nto which these two behaviors share a common neural basis is unknown. A key\ndifference between tethered and free flight conditions is the presence of\nadditional sensory cues in the latter, which might serve to modify the time\ncourse of the saccade motor program.

We wondered if gibbons also make use of an\nefficient gait mechanism during bipedal locomotion. To investigate this, we\ncalculated oscillations of the centre of mass (COM), energy fluctuations,\nrecovery rates and power outputs from the 3D ground reaction forces. These\nground reaction forces were collected during spontaneous bipedal locomotion of\nfour untrained white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) over an\ninstrumented walkway (with an AMTI force plate). Excursions of the COM are\nrelatively large during hylobatid bipedalism and the fluctuations of potential\nand kinetic energy are largely in-phase. Together with the low inverted\npendulum recovery rates, this points to a spring-mass mechanism during bipedal\nlocomotion. Although the well-developed Achilles tendon of gibbons seems to be\na good candidate for the storage and recoil of elastic energy, this is not\nsupported by kinematical data of the ankle joint. Instead, we suggest that the\nknee extensor muscle tendon unit functions as an energy-saving mechanism\nduring hylobatid bipedalism, but detailed anatomical data is needed to confirm\nthis suggestion. At low speeds gibbons use either pendular or spring\nmechanics, but a clear gait transition as seen in most quadrupedal mammals is\nabsent. At moderate to high velocities, gibbons use a bouncing gait, generally\nwithout aerial phases. This supports the view that aerial phases are not a\nprerequisite for spring-mass mechanics and reinforces the claim that duty\nfactor alone should not be used to distinguish between a walk and run."},{"title":"Like a `rolling stone': quantitative analysis of the body movement and\nskeletal dynamics of the sponge Tethya wilhelma","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/15/2839","abstract":"Although sponges (Porifera) are basal Metazoa without muscles and a central\nnervous system, they are able to locomote, which is generally correlated to\ndrastic morphological changes.

In\nparticular, during post-flight days 1-11, tadpoles with lordotic tails from\nall three groups (25-28, 33-36 and 45) showed a lower rVOR gain and amplitude\nthan the 1g-controls. The rVOR gain and amplitude of tadpoles from\nthe groups 25-28 and 33-36 that developed normal tails was not affected by\nmicrogravity while the rVOR of μg-tadpoles from the stage-45 group\nwith normal tails revealed a significant rVOR augmentation. In conclusion: (1)\nthe vestibular system of tadpoles with lordotic tails is developmentally\nretarded by microgravity; (2) after a critical status of vestibular maturation\nobtained during the appearance of first swimming, microgravity activates an\nadaptation mechanism that causes a sensitization of the vestibular system."},{"title":"Neuromodulation of the locust frontal ganglion during the moult: a novel role for insect ecdysis peptides","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/15/2911","abstract":"In insects, continuous growth requires the periodic replacement of the\nexoskeleton during the moult. A moulting insect displays a stereotypical set\nof behaviours that culminate in the shedding of the old cuticle at ecdysis.\nMoulting is an intricate process requiring tightly regulated physiological\nchanges and behaviours to allow integration of environmental cues and to\nensure the proper timing and sequence of its components. This is under complex\nhormonal regulation, and is an important point of interaction between\nendocrine and neural control.Here, we focus on the locust frontal ganglion (FG), an important player in\nmoulting behaviour, as a previously unexplored target for ecdysis peptides. We\nshow that application of 10-7 mol l-1 ecdysis-triggering\nhormone (ETH) or 10-7 mol l-1 and 10-6 mol\nl-1 Pre-ecdysis-triggering hormone (PETH) to an isolated FG\npreparation caused an increase in bursting frequency in the FG, whereas\napplication of 10-6 mol l-1 eclosion hormone (EH) caused\nan instantaneous, though temporary, total inhibition of all FG rhythmic\nactivity. Crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), an important peptide\nbelieved to turn on ecdysis behaviour, caused a dose-dependent increase of FG\nburst frequency. Our results imply a novel role for this peptide in generating\nair-swallowing behaviour during the early stages of ecdysis. Furthermore, we\nshow that the modulatory effects of CCAP on the FG motor circuits are\ndependent on behavioural state and physiological context. Thus, we report that\npre-treatment with ETH caused CCAP-induced effects similar to those induced by\nCCAP alone during pre-ecdysis.

Anatomically, the\npixels correspond to single cone outer segments in humans and to single\nrhabdoms in insects. Although an outer segment and a rhabdom are equivalent\norganelles containing visual pigment molecules, they are strikingly different\nin spectral terms. The cone outer segment is the photoreceptor cell part that\nexpresses a single type of visual pigment, and is therefore monochromatic. On\nthe other hand, a rhabdom is composed of several photoreceptor cells with\ndifferent spectral sensitivities and is therefore polychromatic. The\npolychromatic organization of the rhabdom suggests that insects can resolve\nwavelength information in a single pixel, which is an ability that humans do\nnot have. We first trained the Japanese yellow swallowtail butterfly\nPapilio xuthus to feed on sucrose solution at a paper disk of certain\ncolor.

Ciliated pedal epithelial (CPE) cells\nacting as locomotory effectors may be electrically excitable. To explore this\npossibility we characterized the cells' electrical properties, and found that\nCPE cells have large voltage dependent whole cell currents with two\ncomponents. First, there is a fast activating outward Cl- current\nthat is both voltage and Ca2+ influx dependent\n(ICl(Ca)).

The second current, a voltage dependent proton current\n(IH), activates very slowly and is sensitive to both\nZn2+ and changes in pH.In addition we identify a new cilio-excitatory substance in\nTritonia, viz., dopamine.

We also estimated each tissue's total proton leak by combining\nmitochondrial proton leak rates at 160 mV and tissue mitochondrial density\ndata with published values of relative liver or red muscle mass for each of\nthe three species. In red muscle, total proton leak was not elevated in the\nmako shark relative to the two ectothermic species. In the liver, total proton\nleak would be higher in the mako shark than in both ectothermic species, due\nto a lower proton conductance in the blue shark and a lower liver\nmitochondrial content in the leopard shark, and thus may contribute to\nendothermy."},{"title":"The cellular response to heat stress in the goby Gillichthys\nmirabilis: a cDNA microarray and protein-level analysis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/14/2660","abstract":"The cellular response to stress relies on the rapid induction of genes\nencoding proteins involved in preventing and repairing macromolecular damage\nincurred as a consequence of environmental insult.

We present the first direct measurements of\nmaximum fluid speed capacity, and we use this to calculate local fluid\nacceleration and volumetric flow rate. We also calculated the ingested volume\nand a novel metric of strike accuracy. In addition, we quantified for each\nspecies the effects of gape magnitude, time to peak gape, and swimming speed\non features of the ingested volume of water. Digital particle image\nvelocimetry (DPIV) and high-speed video were used to measure the flow in front\nof the mouths of three fish from each species in conjunction with a vertical\nlaser sheet positioned on the mid-sagittal plane of the fish. From this we\nquantified the maximum fluid speed (in the earthbound and fish's frame of\nreference), acceleration and ingested volume. Our method for determining\nstrike accuracy involved quantifying the location of the prey relative to the\ncenter of the parcel of ingested water. Bluegill sunfish generated higher\nfluid speeds in the earthbound frame of reference, accelerated the fluid\nfaster, and were more accurate than largemouth bass. However, largemouth bass\ningested a larger volume of water and generated a higher volumetric flow rate\nthan bluegill sunfish. In addition, because largemouth bass swam faster during\nprey capture, they generated higher fluid speeds in the fish's frame of\nreference. Thus, while bluegill can exert higher drag forces on stationary\nprey items, largemouth bass more quickly close the distance between themselves\nand prey. The ingested volume and volumetric flow rate significantly increased\nas gape increased for both species, while time to peak gape had little effect\non the volume. However, peak gape distance did not affect the maximum fluid\nspeed entering the mouth for either species. We suggest that species that\ngenerate high fluid speeds in the earthbound frame of reference will commonly\nexhibit small mouths and a high capacity to deliver force to buccal expansion,\nwhile species that ingest a large volume of water and generate high volumetric\nflow rates will have larger buccal cavities and cranial expansion linkage\nsystems that favor displacement over force delivery."},{"title":"Performance-enhancing role of dietary fatty acids in a long-distance migrant shorebird: the semipalmated sandpiper","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/14/2686","abstract":"At the end of summer, semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla)\ntraveling from the Arctic stop in the Bay of Fundy (east coast of Canada) to\nbuild large fat reserves before a non-stop flight to South America.

Nevertheless, 33% of the total increase in energy use (40% of\nthe increase in stance-phase energy use) during uphill running was provided by\npinnate stance-phase muscles. Swing-phase muscles also increase their energy\nexpenditure during uphill running, although to a lesser extent than that\nrequired by running faster on the level. These results suggest that neither\nmuscle–tendon nor musculoskeletal architecture appear to greatly\nrestrict the ability of muscles to do work during locomotor tasks such as\nuphill running, and that the added energy cost of running uphill is not solely\ndue to lifting the body center of mass."},{"title":"Thermal stress on intertidal limpets: long-term hindcasts and lethal limits","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/13/2420","abstract":"When coupled with long-term meteorological records, a heat-budget model for\nthe limpet, Lottia gigantea, provides a wealth of information\nregarding environmental and topographic controls of body temperature in this\necologically important species.

Males\nof the type II morph responded preferentially to EODs of type II females,\nwhereas type I males did not appear to discriminate homotypic and heterotypic\nEODs in our experimental paradigm. Part of this behavioral asymmetry may have\nresulted from a previously undetected difference in adult size, which may have\nenhanced apparent discrimination by the smaller morph (type II) due to a\nrelatively higher risk of injury from the larger morph (type I).

The delta efficiency (change in\nmechanical power divided by the change in metabolic power) of producing this\npower increased from 11% in walking to approximately 25% in running. Although\ntarsometatarsal loading was designed to increase the mechanical energy during\nswing phase, 40% of the increase in segmental energy occurred during late\nstance. Thus, the increased energy demand of distal limb loading in guinea\nfowl is predicted to cause increases in energy use by both stance- and\nswing-phase muscles."},{"title":"The energetic costs of trunk and distal-limb loading during walking and\nrunning in guinea fowl Numida meleagris","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/11/2064","abstract":"We examined the changes in muscle energy use in guinea fowl running at 1.5\nm s-1 either unloaded, or carrying trunk loads equal to 23% of body\nmass, or loads on their distal legs equal to a total of 5% of body mass. We\nestimated muscle energy use by measuring blood flow to all of the leg muscles\nusing injected microspheres. Total blood flow to the leg muscles increased by\napproximately 15% under both loading conditions, which matched the percentage\nincrease in net organismal metabolic rate. Significant increases in energy use\n(inferred from blood flow) above that found in unloaded birds were found in 12\nmuscles in trunk-loaded birds, with most of the increases restricted to\nstance-phase muscles, as predicted. Just three of these muscles, the\nfemerotibialis, the iliotibialis lateralis pars postacetabularis and the\nfibularis longus accounted for 70% of the increased energy use. Noticeably\nabsent from the group of muscles that increased energy use during trunk\nloading were several large biarticular muscles that have extensor actions at\nthe hip or ankle, but flexor actions at the knee. We concluded that the low\nenergetic cost of carrying trunk loads in guinea fowl may rely on the\nactivation of a group of muscles that together provide support and propulsion\nacross all the major joints, without producing opposing moments at other\njoints that could potentially waste energy. The specific leg muscles\nresponsible for the increase in metabolism during trunk loading also suggest\nthat the energy cost of producing mechanical work may be an important\ndeterminant of the cost of carrying extra mass on the trunk. During\ndistal-limb loading, eleven leg muscles had significant increases in energy\nuse, but unlike during trunk loading, both stance- and swing-phase muscles had\nlarge increases in energy use. This distribution of energy use between stance\nand swing agrees with the prediction that increased mechanical work determines\nthe cost of limb loading, because a substantial fraction of the increased\nsegmental work during distal-limb loading in guinea fowl has been found to\noccur during stance."},{"title":"Nutrient regulation in relation to diet breadth: a comparison of\nHeliothis sister species and a hybrid","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/11/2076","abstract":"We examined the nutritional correlates of diet breadth in insect herbivores\nby comparing patterns of diet selection, nutrient balancing, post-ingestive\nutilization and development in two sister species of caterpillar and a hybrid\nbetween them.

The long-term goal of our work is to establish relationships\nbetween suture form and function, so that functional inferences can be made\nfrom suture morphology in fossil taxa. To this end, strain gauges were\nsurgically implanted across selected sutures in the skull roof of four\nindividuals of Polypterus endlicherii. After surgery, bone and suture\nstrains during feeding were recorded along with high-speed video of the\nfeeding events. Each trial was designated as a suction feeding or biting on\nprey trial, and neurocranial elevation, hyoid position and gape were\nquantified to aid in interpreting the strain data. The strains due to suction\nfeeding are different from those observed during biting. Suction feeding\nresults in a fairly stereotyped strain pattern, with the interfrontal and\nfrontoparietal sutures experiencing tension, while the interparietal suture is\ncompressed. Biting causes much more variable strain patterns. However, both\nsuction and biting result in compression in the back of the skull, and tension\nbetween the frontals. Peak strains, and the time at which they occur in the\nfeeding cycle, were compared between suction and biting. In general, peak\nsuture strains are higher during suction than during biting, but not all of\nthese differences are significant. Peak suture and bone strains occur at or\nnear maximum gape during both suction and biting, suggesting that these\nstrains are caused by muscle contraction involved in mouth opening and\nclosing. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) scans of the experimental\nspecimens indicate that the interfrontal and frontoparietal sutures, typically\nloaded in tension, are less interdigitated in cross section than the\ninterparietal suture, which experiences compression. This is consistent with\npublished correlations of suture form and function in mammals, where\ninterdigitated sutures indicate compression and lack of interdigitation is\nassociated with tension."},{"title":"Balancing the competing requirements of saltatorial and fossorial\nspecialisation: burrowing costs in the spinifex hopping mouse, Notomys\nalexis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/11/2103","abstract":"Semi-fossorial animals (burrowing surface foragers) need to balance the\ncompeting morphological requirements of terrestrial and burrowing locomotion.\nThese species rarely show the same degree of claw, forelimb and pectoral\ngirdle structural development that fully fossorial forms (burrowing\nsubterranean foragers) do, but nevertheless invest considerable amounts of\nenergy in burrow systems.

A phylogenetically\nindependent-contrasts approach revealed that morphological specialisation for\nburrowing was associated with low maximum running speeds in fossorial mammals\nand, for non-fossorial rodents and marsupials, maximum running speed was\npositively correlated with an index of habitat structure that ranged from\narboreal to open desert.

In order to advance further our understanding of\nepithelial tissue stem cells, new in vivo models are required. The\npresent study focuses on the dynamics of a new and simple model of intestinal\nepithelial regeneration found in the midgut of the migratory locust,\nLocusta migratoria (Linnaeus 1758). The locust midgut consists of\nthree cell types: columnar cells, endocrine cells and undifferentiated\nregenerative clustered cells. The undifferentiated epithelial midgut cells\ngive rise to two other cell types and are located in a nest of regenerative\ncells known as regenerative niche. We have performed single and continuous\nbromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) administration experiments to study regeneration\nniches and their cellular dynamics. Immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence\ntechniques were used to detect the incorporation of BrdU into regenerative\nniches and the presence of FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity, as a marker for\nendocrine cell differentiation. Some isolated label retaining cells (LRC) were\nobserved at the niche base 10-15 days after the final BrdU administration. We\npropose that these cells are the stem cells of this epithelial tissue. We also\ncalculated the length of the cell cycle phases for a subpopulation of transit\namplifying cells within the regenerative niche: G1, 2.5±0.5 h; S,\n5.5±0.5 h; G2, 0.75±0.25 h; M, 2.5±0.5 h. These\namplifying cells will give rise to the columnar epithelial non-endocrine\nlineage. The differentiation of an endocrine cell from a niche stem cell\noccurs less frequently and thus leads to a lower proportion of endocrine cells\nas compared with epithelial columnar digestive cells (up to three endocrine\ncells per niche). Endocrine cell commitment seems to occur very early in the\ndifferentiation process within the niche, as double-labelled BrdU and FMRF\nendocrine cells have never been found.

In terms\nof motor control, such adaptive behaviour typically involves changes in the\nkinematics of the perturbed limb as well as changes in coordination between\nlegs. Moreover, the unpredictable variety of real life situations implies that\ncompensatory responses should be sensitive to the behavioural context of the\nanimal. We have investigated the extent to which the compensatory response of\na walking stick insect (Carausius morosus) adapts in parallel to\nstrong context-dependent adaptation of step kinematics and inter-leg\ncoordination. The behavioural contexts we chose were straight walking and\nvisually induced curve walking, for both of which the steady state limb\nkinematics and inter-leg coupling strengths were known. In case of curve\nwalking, we further distinguished contexts according to whether the inner or\nthe outer leg was perturbed. The three contexts differed strongly with respect\nto the set of joint actions before perturbation. Upon mechanical perturbation\nof front leg protraction, we studied context-dependent differences in a local\navoidance reflex of the perturbed leg, as well as in coordination mechanisms\nthat couple the step cycles of the perturbed leg to its unperturbed\nneighbours.In all three walking contexts, obstacle contact caused an avoidance\nmovement of the front leg that deviated from the unperturbed swing trajectory.\nSwing duration was increased while step distance was decreased; however, both\neffects vanished in the subsequent unperturbed step. The prevailing immediate\nreaction of the three leg joints were retraction of the coxa (>76%),\nlevation of the femur (>80%), and flexion of the tibia (>80%),\nregardless of the behavioural context and, therefore, joint action prior to\nperturbation. Moreover, activation of each one of these joint actions was\nshown to be independent of the other two. Thus, local avoidance reflexes are\nnot modulated by the descending visual information that causes transition from\nstraight to curve walking, but are composed of context-independent joint\nactions.Perturbation of the front leg also caused significant shifts of the\ntouch-down position of the perturbed leg and of its unperturbed neighbours. If\nthe inner front leg was perturbed, this shift could persist until the\nsubsequent step. Perturbation affected both the spatial location and the\ntiming of touch-down and lift-off transitions in unperturbed neighbouring\nlegs. These effects on inter-leg coordination were context-dependent. For\nexample, time delay to lift-off of the contralateral neighbour was shortened\nin inner and straight walking legs, but not in outer legs. Finally, a\ntargeting mechanism that determines foot placement in stick insects was shown\nto be affected by perturbation in a context-dependent manner.We conclude that the immediate compensatory response of the perturbed leg\nis not adapted to the behavioural context in spite of strongly differing step\nkinematics, whereas the compensatory effect on inter-limb coupling is\ncontext-dependent."},{"title":"Flight and echolocation behaviour of whiskered bats commuting along a hedgerow: range-dependent sonar signal design, Doppler tolerance and evidence for `acoustic focussing'","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/10/1816","abstract":"Echolocating bats obtain three-dimensional images of their surroundings in\ncomplete darkness by emitting sonar signals and evaluating returning echoes.\nWhen flying close to objects, bats risk collision and therefore depend on the\naccuracy of images – particularly in the perceived distance of\nobstacles, which is coded by the time delay between call and echo.

Flexible organisms, like\nmacroalgae, often experience lower drag than rigid organisms because their\nshape and size change as velocity increases. This phenomenon, known as\nreconfiguration, has been previously quantified as Vogel's E, a\nmeasure of the relationship between velocity and drag. While this method is\nvery useful for comparing reconfiguration among organisms it does not address\nthe mechanisms of reconfiguration, and its application to predicting drag is\nproblematic. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine the\nmechanisms of reconfiguration by quantifying the change in shape and size of a\nmacroalga in flow and (2) to build a mechanistic model of drag for\nreconfiguring organisms. Drag, frontal area and shape of the intertidal alga\nChondrus crispus were measured simultaneously in a recirculating\nflume at water velocities from 0 to ∼2 m s–1.\nReconfiguration was due to two separate mechanisms: whole-alga realignment\n(deflection of the stipe) at low velocities (<0.2 m s–1)\nand compaction of the crown (reduction in frontal area and change in shape) at\nhigher velocities. Change in frontal area contributed more to drag reduction\nthan change in drag coefficient. Drag coefficient and frontal area both\ndecrease exponentially with increasing water velocity, and a mechanistic model\nof drag was developed with explicit functions to describe these changes. The\nmodel not only provides mechanistic parameters with which to compare\nreconfiguration among individuals and species, but also allows for more\nreliable predictions of drag at high, ecologically relevant water\nvelocities."},{"title":"Water dynamics in the digestive tract of the freshwater rainbow trout during the processing of a single meal","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/10/1883","abstract":"The temporal effects of feeding and digestion on chyme composition,\nspecifically water and solid content, and net fluxes across the\ngastrointestinal tract, as well as plasma parameters, were examined in\nfreshwater rainbow trout.

Based on an outgroup species, Teratocephalus\nlirellus, the ancestral pattern of pharyngeal behaviors consisted of\ncorpus pumping, isthmus peristalsis and terminal bulb pumping, each occurring\nindependently. Whereas corpus pumping remained largely conserved, isthmus and\nterminal bulb behaviors evolved extensively from the ancestral pattern in the\nfour major free-living soil nematode families. In the Rhabditidae family,\nwhich includes Caenorhabditis elegans, the anterior isthmus switched\nfrom peristalsis to pumping, and anterior isthmus and terminal bulb pumping\nbecame coupled to corpus pumping. In the Diplogasteridae family, the terminal\nbulb switched from pumping to peristalsis, and isthmus and terminal bulb\nbecame coupled for peristalsis. In the Cephalobidae family, isthmus\nperistalsis and terminal bulb pumping became coupled. And in the\nPanagrolaimidae family, the posterior isthmus switched from peristalsis to\npumping.

Black bears\n(Ursus americanus) are inactive for up to six months during\nhibernation, yet bone mineral content and strength do not decrease with disuse\nor aging. To test whether hibernating bears have biological mechanisms to\nprevent disuse osteoporosis, we measured the serum concentrations of hormones\nand growth factors involved in bone metabolism and correlated them with the\nserum concentration of a bone formation marker (osteocalcin). Serum was\nobtained from black bears over a 7-month duration that included periods of\nactivity and inactivity. Both resorption and formation markers increased\nduring hibernation, suggesting high bone turnover occurred during inactivity.\nHowever, bone formation appeared to be balanced with bone resorption. The\nserum concentration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) was higher in the hibernation\n(P=0.35) and post-hibernation (P=0.006) seasons relative to\npre-hibernation levels.

There was no difference (P=0.64) in 25-OH vitamin D\nbetween the three seasons. Serum osteocalcin (bone formation marker) was\nsignificantly correlated with PTH, but not with leptin, IGF-I or 25-OH vitamin\nD. Osteocalcin and PTH were positively correlated when samples from all\nseasons were pooled and when only hibernation samples were considered, raising\nthe possibility that the anabolic actions of PTH help maintain bone formation\nto prevent disuse osteoporosis. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)\nrelease from MC3T3 osteoblastic cells was significantly affected by treatment\nwith bear serum from different seasons (i.e. hibernation versus active\nperiods). The seasonal changes in PGE2 release showed trends\nsimilar to the seasonal changes in serum IGF-I. Since both PGE2 and\nIGF-I are associated with collagenous bone formation, it is possible that\nseasonal changes in a circulating factor influence IGF-I levels in\nvivo in bears and PGE2 release in osteoblastic cells in vitro.\nThe significant decrease in serum leptin following arousal from hibernation\nmay promote bone formation during remobilization, assuming there is a similar\ndecrease in intracerebroventricular leptin. These findings support the idea\nthat seasonal changes in the concentration of circulating molecules help\nregulate bone formation activity and may be important for preventing disuse\nosteoporosis in bears."},{"title":"Metabolic scaling associated with unusual size changes during larval\ndevelopment of the frog, Pseudis paradoxus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/9/1651","abstract":"The early larvae of P. paradoxus grow large but metamorphose into\nrelatively small frogs, the diminished post-metamorphic growth producing a\nmarked contrast between maximum larval size and adult.

It has been assumed that in\na diffusion-based system, each spiracle contributes to oxygen flux into and\ncarbon dioxide flux out of the tracheal system according to the size of its\nopening. We evaluated this hypothesis by determining how a reduction in size\nand interference with the spatial distribution of gas exchange areas impair\nflight muscle function and aerodynamic force production in the small fruit fly\nDrosophila melanogaster. This was done by selectively blocking\nthoracic spiracles of tethered flies flying inside a flight simulator.\nFlow-through respirometry and simultaneous measurements of flight force\nproduction and wing kinematics revealed a negligible functional safety margin\nfor respiration. Maximum locomotor performance was only achieved by\nunmanipulated flies, supporting the general assumption that at the animal's\nmaximum locomotor capacity, maximum spiracle opening area matches respiratory\nneed. The maximum total buffer capacity for carbon dioxide in\nDrosophila amounts to approximately 33.5 μl g–1\nbody mass, estimated from the temporal integral of carbon dioxide release rate\nduring the resting period after flight. By comparing flight variables in\nunmanipulated and `spiracle-blocked' flies at comparable flight forces, we\nfound that (i) stroke amplitude, stroke frequency and the chemo-mechanical\nconversion efficiency of the indirect flight musculature were broadly\nindependent of the arrangement of spiracle conductance, while (ii) muscle\nmechanical power significantly increased, and (iii) mean lift coefficient and\naerodynamic efficiency significantly decreased up to approximately 50% with an\nincreasing number of blocked spiracles.

This\njointed construction makes calcified fronds as flexible as fleshy seaweeds,\nallowing them to `go with the flow' when struck by breaking waves.

Here, I describe the allometric scaling of geniculum size, breaking\nforce and tissue strength along articulated fronds in two species of\nCalliarthron. Genicular material is much stronger than tissue from\nfleshy macroalgae. Moreover, as fronds grow, genicula get bigger and their\ntissue strengthens, two processes that help them resist breakage. Within\nindividual fronds, larger branches, which presumably experience greater drag\nforce, are supported by bigger, stronger genicula. However, frond growth\ngreatly outpaces genicular strengthening. As a result, Calliarthron\nfronds most likely break at their bases when critically stressed by incoming\nwaves.

In teleosts, the gills are in direct contact\nwith an aquatic environment and are the dominant site of osmoregulation.\nDuring transfers between salinities, specialized cells in the gills (chloride\ncells) rapidly regulate NaCl secretion for systemic osmoregulation while they\nsimultaneously are exposed to acute osmotic shock. This study was conducted to\ndetermine if COX2 is expressed in the gills, and if so, to evaluate its\nfunction in cellular and systemic osmoregulation. Degenerate primers, reverse\ntranscription–PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends were used to\ndeduce the complete cDNA sequence of a putative COX2 enzyme from the gills of\nthe euryhaline killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). The 2738 base pair\ncDNA includes a coding region for a 610 amino acid protein that is over 70%\nidentical to mammalian COX2. A purified antibody generated against a conserved\nregion of mouse COX2 labeled chloride cells, suggesting that the enzyme may\ncontrol NaCl secretion as an autocrine agent. Real-time PCR was then used to\ndemonstrate that mRNA expression of the COX2 homologue was threefold greater\nin gills from chronic seawater killifish than in gills from chronic freshwater\nkillifish. Expression of Na+/K+/2Cl–\ncotransporter and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator were\nalso greater in seawater, suggesting that chronic COX2 expression in the gills\nis regulated in parallel to the key ion transporters that mediate NaCl\nsecretion. Real-time PCR was also used to demonstrate that acute transfer from\nseawater to freshwater and from freshwater to seawater led to rapid, transient\ninductions of COX2 expression. Together with previous physiological evidence,\nthe present molecular and immunological data suggest that constitutive\nbranchial COX2 expression is enhanced in seawater, where prostaglandins can\nregulate NaCl secretion in chloride cells.

This\nsuggests that the lower limit is dictated by the aphid feeding response,\nspecifically, a requirement for a minimal concentration of sucrose for\nsustained feeding. The haemolymph osmotic pressure of aphids on diets with\n0.125–1.5 mol l–1 sucrose was up to 68% higher than on\n0.125–1.0 mol l–1 sucrose diets, but diet consumption\nand sucrose-carbon assimilation was not reduced on the very high sucrose diets\nrelative to 1.0 mol l–1 sucrose.

Some changes in\ndroplet composition were broadly consistent with differing synthetic\ncapacities: molar percentages of less readily synthesized compounds (e.g.\ncholine, isethionate, N-acetyltaurine) typically declined with\nstarvation, at least during a portion of the imposed fast, while more readily\nsynthesized compounds (e.g. GABamide, glycine) tended to increase. Most\nstriking was the apparent partial substitution of N-acetylputrescine\nby the more readily synthesized GABamide in fasting Argiope\ntrifasciata. However, departures from expected compositional shifts\ndemonstrated that synthetic capacity alone does not adequately predict sticky\ndroplet compositional shifts with starvation. Moreover, feeding controls\nexhibited some changes in composition similar to starving spiders.

From\na hydrodynamic standpoint, the functional significance of this diversity is\npoorly understood, largely because the three-dimensional flow around swimming\nfish is almost completely unknown. Fully three-dimensional volumetric flow\nmeasurements are not currently feasible, but measurements in multiple\ntransverse planes along the body can illuminate many of the important flow\nfeatures. In this study, I analyze flow in the transverse plane at a range of\npositions around bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, from the\ntrailing edges of the dorsal and anal fins to the near wake. Simultaneous\nparticle image velocimetry and kinematic measurements were performed during\nswimming at 1.2 body lengths s–1 to describe the streamwise\nvortex structure, to quantify the contributions of each fin to the vortex\nwake, and to assess the importance of three-dimensional flow effects in\nswimming.Sunfish produce streamwise vortices from at least eight distinct places,\nincluding both the dorsal and ventral margins of the soft dorsal and anal\nfins, and the tips and central notched region of the caudal fin. I propose a\nthree-dimensional structure of the vortex wake in which these vortices from\nthe caudal notch are elongated by the dorso-ventral cupping motion of the\ntail, producing a structure like a hairpin vortex in the caudal fin vortex\nring. Vortices from the dorsal and anal fin persist into the wake, probably\nlinking up with the caudal fin vortices. These dorsal and anal fin vortices do\nnot differ significantly in circulation from the two caudal fin tip vortices.\nBecause the circulations are equal and the length of the trailing edge of the\ncaudal fin is approximately equal to the combined trailing edge length of the\ndorsal and anal fins, I argue that the two anterior median fins produce a\ntotal force that is comparable to that of the caudal fin. To provide\nadditional detail on how different positions contribute to total force along\nthe posterior body, the change in vortex circulation as flow passes down the\nbody is also analyzed. The posterior half of the caudal fin and the dorsal and\nanal fins add vortex circulation to the flow, but circulation appears to\ndecrease around the peduncle and anterior caudal fin. Kinematic measurements\nindicate that the tail is angled correctly to enhance thrust through this\ninteraction. Finally, the degree to which the caudal fin acts like a idealized\ntwo-dimensional plate is examined: approximately 25% of the flow near the tail\nis accelerated up and down, rather than laterally, producing wasted momentum,\na loss not present in ideal two-dimensional theories."},{"title":"Swim speeds and stroke patterns in wing-propelled divers: a comparison among alcids and a penguin","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/7/1217","abstract":"In diving birds, the volume and resulting buoyancy of air spaces changes\nwith dive depth, and hydrodynamic drag varies with swim speed.

Using small data-loggers on free-ranging birds\ndiving to 20–30 m depth, we measured depth at 1 Hz and surge and heave\naccelerations at 32–64 Hz of four species of alcids (0.6–1.0 kg\nmass) and the smallest penguin species (1.2 kg). Low- and high-frequency\ncomponents of the fluctuation of acceleration yielded estimates of body angles\nand stroke frequencies, respectively. Swim speed was estimated from body angle\nand rate of depth change. Brünnich's (Uria lomvia) and common\n(Uria aalge) guillemots descended almost vertically, whereas descent\nof razorbills (Alca torda), rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca\nmonocerata) and little penguins (Eudyptula minor) was more\noblique. For all species, swim speed during descent was within a relatively\nnarrow range. Above depths of 20–30 m, where they were all positively\nbuoyant, all species ascended without wing stroking. During descent, little\npenguins made forward accelerations on both the upstroke and downstroke\nregardless of dive depth. By contrast, descending alcids produced forward\naccelerations on both upstroke and downstroke at depths of <10 m but mainly\non the downstroke at greater depths; this change seemed to correspond to the\ndecrease of buoyancy with increasing depth. The magnitude of surge (forward)\nacceleration during downstrokes was smaller, and that during upstrokes\ngreater, in little penguins than in alcids. This pattern presumably reflected\nthe proportionally greater mass of upstroke muscles in penguins compared with\nalcids and may allow little penguins to swim at less variable instantaneous\nspeeds."},{"title":"Effect of osmotic stress on expression of a putative facilitative urea\ntransporter in the kidney and urinary bladder of the marine toad, Bufo\nmarinus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/7/1207","abstract":"Anuran amphibians accumulate a large amount of urea in their extracellular\nfluids to avoid a severe dehydration under dry and hyper-saline environments.\nTo clarify the mechanisms of urea retention, we examined structure and\ndistribution of the urea transporter (UT) in the kidney of the marine toad\n(Bufo marinus), and its expression in the kidney and urinary bladder\nfollowing exposure to dry and hyper-saline conditions by means of cDNA\ncloning, semi-quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblot analysis and\nimmunohistochemistry.

For the head, this\nresults in almost pure translational optic flow between saccades, enabling\nvisual interneurons in the fly motion pathway to extract information about\ntranslation of the animal and thereby about the spatial layout of the\nenvironment. There are noticeable differences between head and body movements\nduring flight. Head saccades are faster and shorter than body saccades, and\nthe head orientation is more stable between saccades than the body\norientation. Here, we analyse the functional importance of these differences\nby probing visual interneurons of the blowfly motion pathway with optic flow\nbased on either head movements or body movements, as recorded accurately with\na magnetic search coil technique. We find that the precise head–body\ncoordination is essential for the visual system to separate the translational\nfrom the rotational optic flow. If the head were tightly coupled to the body,\nthe resulting optic flow would not contain the behaviourally important\ninformation on translation. Since it is difficult to resolve head orientation\nin many experimental paradigms, even when employing state-of-the-art digital\nvideo techniques, we introduce a `headifying algorithm', which transforms the\ntime-dependent body orientation in free flight into an estimate of head\norientation. We show that application of this algorithm leads to an estimated\nhead orientation between saccades that is sufficiently stable to enable\nrecovering information on translation.

Instantaneous velocity of the whale was determined from the\nmagnitude of turbulent flow noise measured by the hydrophone and confirmed by\nkinematic analysis. Fin whales employed gliding gaits during descent, executed\na series of lunges at depth and ascended to the surface by steady fluking. Our\nexamination of body kinematics at depth reveals variable lunge-feeding\nbehavior in the context of distinct kinematic modes, which exhibit temporal\ncoordination of rotational torques with translational accelerations. Maximum\nswimming speeds during lunges match previous estimates of the flow-induced\npressure needed to completely expand the buccal cavity during feeding."},{"title":"Temperature regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in a\npoikilothermic vertebrate, crucian carp (Carassius carassius)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/6/994","abstract":"Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1) is a master regulator of\nhypoxia-induced gene responses.

In the heart and kidney\nHIF-1 activity was already significantly increased in the 18°C acclimated\nfish. Temperature also affected hypoxic regulation of HIF-1. Although hypoxia\ninitially increased amounts of HIF-1α protein in all studied tissues at\nevery temperature, except for liver at 18°C, HIF-1 activity increased only\nin the heart of 8°C acclimated and in the gills of 18°C acclimated\nfish.

Thus, their\nvision is potentially affected by changes in the spectral quality of twilight\nand nocturnal illumination, due to the presence or absence of the moon,\nartificial light pollution and other factors. We investigated this in the\nfollowing manner. First we measured the spectral irradiance (from 300 to 700\nnm) during the day, sunset, twilight, full moon, new moon, and in the presence\nof high levels of light pollution. The spectra were then converted to both\nhuman-based chromaticities and to relative quantum catches for the nocturnal\nhawkmoth Deilephila elpenor, which has color vision. The reflectance\nspectra of various flowers and leaves and the red hindwings of D.\nelpenor were also converted to chromaticities and relative quantum\ncatches. Finally, the achromatic and chromatic contrasts (with and without von\nKries color constancy) of the flowers and hindwings against a leaf background\nwere determined under the various lighting environments. The twilight and\nnocturnal illuminants were substantially different from each other, resulting\nin significantly different contrasts. The addition of von Kries color\nconstancy significantly reduced the effect of changing illuminants on\nchromatic contrast, suggesting that, even in this light-limited environment,\nthe ability of color vision to provide reliable signals under changing\nilluminants may offset the concurrent threefold decrease in sensitivity and\nspatial resolution. Given this, color vision may be more common in crepuscular\nand nocturnal species than previously considered."},{"title":"Distribution, activity and evidence for the release of an anti-diuretic\npeptide in the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/5/907","abstract":"In the haematophagous insect Rhodnius prolixus, diuresis is\naccomplished through the combined actions of peptidergic diuretic hormones and\n5-HT released from neurohaemal sites on the abdominal nerves.

Three\nring-tailed lemurs and two patas monkeys performed turns of approximately\n30° as they crossed a force platform. The ring-tailed lemurs also turned\non a horizontal branch-like support with a segment attached to the force\ntransducer. Mediolateral forces of up to 40% body weight were recorded. These\nare considerably higher than during linear locomotion. Pivot limbs in ground\nturns and turns on the branch differed in the lemurs, suggesting that\nsubstrate influences turning strategies. Limbs encountered both medial and\nlateral reaction forces, and as a result, they may be exposed to variable\nbending regimes in the frontal plane. The stereotypy in bending regimes\nsuggested by in vivo bone strain studies, therefore, may characterize\nlinear locomotion only. The lemurs showed hindlimb dominance in turns, both in\nterms of frequency used as well as force magnitude (hindlimb steering).\nHindlimb dominance in weight support characterizes both species (and primates\nin general), but it is more pronounced in the lemurs. In the patas monkeys,\nforces were more evenly distributed among the two pairs of limbs. The\nmediolateral turning forces therefore seem to track the amount of weight to be\nshifted sideways. Overall variance in mediolateral forces was greater in the\narboreal and versatile lemurs than in the terrestrial and cursorial patas\nmonkeys."},{"title":"Contractile recovery from acidosis in toad ventricle is independent of\nintracellular pH and relies upon Ca2+ influx","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/5/916","abstract":"Hypercapnic acidosis produces a negative inotropic effect on myocardial\ncontractility followed by a partial recovery that occurs in spite of the\npersistent extracellular acidosis.

The main goal of the present experiments was to obtain a better\nunderstanding of these mechanisms in the toad heart. Hypercapnic acidosis,\ninduced by switching from a bicarbonate-buffered solution equilibrated with 5%\nCO2 to the same solution equilibrated with 12% CO2,\nevoked a decrease in contractility followed by a recovery that reached values\nhigher than controls after 30 min of continued acidosis.

Blockade of the Na+/H+ exchanger\n(NHE) with cariporide (5 μmol l–1) produced a complete\ninhibition of pHi restitution, without affecting the mechanical\nrecovery. Hypercapnic acidosis also produced a gradual increase of diastolic\nand peak Ca2+i transient values, which occurred\nimmediately after the acidosis was settled and persisted during the mechanical\nrecovery phase. Inhibition of Ca2+ influx through the reverse mode\nof the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) by KB-R (1 μmol\nl–1 for myocytes and 20 μmol l–1 for\nventricular strips), or of L-type Ca2+ channels by nifedipine (0.5μ\nmol l–1), completely abolished the mechanical recovery.\nAcidosis also produced an increase in the action potential duration.

Our results show that\nin toad ventricular myocardium, acidosis produces a decrease in contractility,\ndue to a decrease in Ca2+ myofilament responsiveness, followed by a\ncontractile recovery, which is independent of pHi recovery and\nrelies on an increase in the influx of Ca2+. The results further\nindicate that both the reverse mode NCX and the L-type Ca2+\nchannels, appear to be involved in the increase in intracellular\nCa2+ concentration that mediates the contractile recovery from\nacidosis."},{"title":"Critical temperatures in the cephalopod Sepia officinalis\ninvestigated using in vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/5/891","abstract":"The present study was designed to test the hypothesis of an oxygen\nlimitation defining thermal tolerance in the European cuttlefish (Sepia\nofficinalis).

Accordingly,\nmainly MMPA of >2 kPa affected muscle PLA reserves, indicating that\ncontractions with MMPA of <2 kPa only involve the thin layers of aerobic\ncircular mantle musculature. On average, no more than 20% of muscle PLA was\ndepleted during spontaneous exercise under control conditions.Subjecting animals to acute thermal change at an average rate of 1 deg.\nh–1 led to significant Pi accumulation (equivalent\nto PLA breakdown) and decrements in the free energy of ATP hydrolysis\n(dG/dζ) at both ends of the temperature window, starting at mean\ncritical temperatures (Tc) of 7.0 and 26.8°C,\nrespectively.

This results\nsuggest that liposomes alone did not add any nutritive value to the diet,\nmaking them a good candidate as inert carriers to study the nutrient\nrequirements or biological activity of different compounds. In particular,\nsuch liposomes are proposed as carriers for diatom-derived polyunsaturated\naldehydes, which are known to impair copepod embryo viability.

This\nstudy evaluates the influence of three aspects of wave action on the thread\nproduction of M. edulis. Mussels were exposed to flow, acceleration\nand byssal loading stimuli and the subsequent number of byssal threads\nproduced in the laboratory was monitored. Increased flow elicited the\nstrongest response, significantly decreasing thread production in mussels.\nThis result was confirmed in flume experiments exposing mussels to a range of\nflows, with reduced thread production above 15 cm s–1.

To date, no study has assessed the\nimpact of depth on diving energetics over a significant depth range, naturally\nencountered by the diver. We used open-circuit respirometry to study the\nenergetic requirements of a foot-propelled pursuit diver, the double-crested\ncormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus albociliatus), when diving in a\nshallow (1 m) and deep (10 m) dive tank and when resting in air and water. We\nalso investigated the modifying effects of air or water temperature and\nfeeding status on the costs associated with diving and resting. Of all factors\ninvestigated, dive depth exercised the strongest influence on diving metabolic\nrate. Diving to 10 m depth increased metabolic rate on average by 22% when\ncompared with shallow diving. Declining temperatures in air and water\nsignificantly elevated metabolic rate of cormorants resting in air and water\nas well as during diving. Feeding before resting in water or diving increased\nmetabolic rate by 5–8% for at least 2 h. Cormorants maintained an\nelevated stomach temperature (>42°C) when resting in water and during\ndiving, even at cold temperatures. The elevated dive costs during deep diving,\nwhen compared with shallow diving, are most likely a consequence of the\nincreased thermoregulatory costs associated with a greater heat loss to the\nwater at depth. Nevertheless, our study shows that dive costs in\ndouble-crested cormorants are similar to those of other foot-propelled avian\ndivers."},{"title":"Effects of larval nutrition on the endocrinology of mosquito egg development","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/4/645","abstract":"Reproduction by female mosquitoes is dependent on energy resources but\nmodulated by hormones.

We have examined the structure and function of the\nenzyme cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (cMDH) from these species, as well as\nfrom the more distantly related ribbed mussel, Mytilus californianus,\nto characterize the effects of temperature on kinetic properties thought to\nexhibit thermal adaptation. The M. trossulus cMDH ortholog differs\nfrom the other cMDHs in a direction consistent with cold adaptation, as\nevidenced by a higher and more temperature-sensitive Michaelis-Menten constant\nfor the cofactor NADH (KmNADH). This difference\nresults from minor changes in sequence: the M. trossulus ortholog\ndiffers from the M. galloprovincialis ortholog by only two\nsubstitutions in the 334 amino acid monomer, and the M. californianus\nand M. trossulus orthologs differ by five substitutions. In each\ncase, only one of these substitutions is non-conservative. To test the effects\nof individual substitutions on kinetic properties, we used site-directed\nmutagenesis to create recombinant cMDHs. Recombinant wild-type M.\ntrossulus cMDH (rWT) has high KmNADH\ncompared with mutants incorporating the non-conservative substitutions found\nin M. californianus and M. galloprovincialis - V114H and\nV114N, respectively - demonstrating that these mutations are responsible for\nthe differences found in substrate affinity. Turnover number\n(kcat) is also higher in rWT compared with the two\nmutants, consistent with cold adaptation in the M. trossulus\northolog. Conversely, rWT and V114H appear more thermostable than V114N. Based\non a comparison of KmNADH and\nkcat values among the orthologs, we propose that immersion\ntemperatures are of greater selective importance in adapting kinetic\nproperties than the more extreme temperatures that occur during emersion.

The detachment rate of myosin heads was deduced from two types of\nexperiments.

We found that moderate alkalisation induces relaxation of skinned\nfibres in catch, thereby reducing both force and stiffness, whereas it does\nnot accelerate the rate of myosin head detachment. This acceleration, however,\nwould be expected if catch would be simply due to myosin heads remaining\nsustainably attached to actin filaments.

In both tissues enzyme properties changed significantly\nduring estivation: maximal activity was reduced by about one-third, affinity\nfor Mg.ATP was reduced (Km was 40% higher), and activation\nenergy (derived from Arrhenius plots) was increased by ∼45%. Foot muscle\nNa+/K+-ATPase from estivated snails also showed an 80%\nincrease in Km Na+ and a 60% increase in\nKa Mg2+ as compared with active snails, whereas\nhepatopancreas Na+/K+-ATPase showed a 70% increase in\nI50 K+ during estivation.

It is then of interest to ask\nwhether or not such results are specific to walking only, or indicate a more\ngeneral feature of locomotion control. The current study examines running gait\nselection within the framework of constrained optimization by comparing\nself-selected running gaits to the gaits predicted by constrained optimization\nof a cost surface constructed from cost data available in the literature.\nNormalizing speed and frequency values in the behavioral data by preferred\nspeed and frequency reduced inter-subject variability and made group\nbehavioral trends more visible.

Although\nsupported by experiments where mass is added to an individual's limbs, mammals\nwith naturally occurring distally heavy limbs such as primates have similar\nenergy costs compared with other mammals. This study presents a new hypothesis\nto explain how animals with distally heavy limbs maintain low energy costs.\nSince distal mass should increase energy costs due to higher amounts of\nmuscular power outputs, this hypothesis is based on the divergent effects of\nstride frequency on internal and external power outputs (the power output to\nmove the limbs and the body center of mass, respectively). The use of low\nstride frequencies reduces limb velocities and therefore decreases internal\npower, while associated long strides increase the vertical displacement of the\nbody center of mass and therefore increase external power. Total power (the\nsum of internal and external power) may therefore not differ among mammals\nwith different limb mass distributions. To test this hypothesis, I examined a\nsample of infant baboons (Papio cynocephalus) during ontogeny and\ncompared them with more cursorial mammals. Limb mass distribution changes with\nage (from distal to more proximally concentrated) in baboons, and the infants\nused shorter strides and higher stride frequencies when limb mass was most\nproximally concentrated. Compared with non-primates who have more proximally\nconcentrated limb mass, the infants used longer strides and lower stride\nfrequencies. Relatively low internal power was associated with low stride\nfrequencies in both the intra- and inter-specific samples. However, only in\nthe inter-specific comparison were relatively long strides associated with\nhigh external power outputs. In both the intra-specific and the inter-specific\nsamples, total power did not differ between groups who differed in limb mass\ndistribution. The results of this study suggest that a trade-off mechanism is\navailable to quadrupeds with distally heavy limbs allowing them to maintain\nsimilar total power outputs (and likely similar energy costs) compared with\nmammals with more proximally concentrated limb mass."},{"title":"The relationship between 3-D kinematics and gliding performance in the\nsouthern flying squirrel, Glaucomys volans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/4/689","abstract":"Gliding is the simplest form of flight, yet relatively little is known\nabout its mechanics in animals.

To do this, I used a pair of\nhigh-speed digital cameras to record a portion of the middle of glides by\nsouthern flying squirrels, Glaucomys volans. The squirrels launched\nfrom a height of 4 m and landed on a vertical pole. Reflective markers were\napplied to anatomical landmarks and the 3-D coordinates of these points were\ncomputed to describe the kinematics of the glides. From these data I estimated\nthe lift and drag generated during the glide, and correlated these variables\nwith gliding performance as measured by glide angle, glide speed and\nstability. In the majority of the glide sequences the squirrels accelerated in\nthe downward direction and accelerated horizontally forward as they moved\nthrough the calibrated volume in the middle of the glide trajectory, rather\nthan exhibiting a steady glide in which the body weight is balanced by the\nresultant aerodynamic force. Compared to human engineered airfoils, the angles\nof attack used by the squirrels were unexpectedly high, ranging from 35.4°\nto 53.5°, far above the angle of attack at which an aircraft wing would\ntypically stall. As expected based on aerodynamic theory, there was a negative\ncorrelation between angle of attack and lift coefficient, indicating that the\nwings are stalled, and a positive correlation between angle of attack and drag\ncoefficient. Also as expected, there was a negative correlation between\nlift-to-drag ratio and angle of attack, as increasing angle of attack produced\nboth less lift and more drag. Within glides, there was a strong correlation\nbetween nose-down pitching rotations and limb movements that tended to\nincrease the angle of attack of the wing membrane, suggesting that the animals\nactively control their pitch by moving their limbs. The squirrels used much\nsteeper glide angles than those reported for other gliding animals, ranging\nfrom 40.4° to 57.4°. It is likely that this is because they did not\nlaunch from a great enough height to reach their minimum glide angle. In some\ntrials the glide angle increased over the captured portion of the glide,\nwhereas in others it decreased, and the magnitude of the changes varied\nsubstantially, rendering it difficult to ascertain which portion of the glide\ntrajectory was represented.

Based on these stimuli, individual\nbees tune their dances according to their colony's nectar influx without\nvisiting alternative nectar sources.Division of labour, in addition, is a common feature in honeybees. Upon\nreturning to the nest, successful foragers transfer the content of their crops\nto food-receivers by means of a common behaviour in social insects called\ntrophallaxis, i.e. the transfer of liquid food by mouth. Martin Lindauer\nstated that a returned forager may sense the foraging status of its colony on\nthe basis of the food transfer process by computing how quickly and eagerly\nthe food-receivers unload its crop.This study focuses on the forager's experience during the food transfer\nprocess, its variability based on the colony's nectar influx, and the separate\neffects that the `ease' and the `eagerness' of the food-unloading have on the\ntuning of recruitment dances.

Here we apply\nthis principle to understanding the effects of size on locomotion within a\nspecies: the domestic horse. We predict that, without any factor to compensate\nfor size differences, detectable deviations from dynamically similar\nlocomotion would occur over the size range present in adult horses. We\nmeasured relative stride length (RSL) and duty factor (DF) in 21 trotting\nhorses (body mass: 86-714 kg), and interpolated the data to predict RSL and DF\nat equivalent speeds (Froude numbers: 0.5, 0.75, 1.0). RSL and DF at equal\nFroude number were not significantly related to body mass. This is consistent\nwith the hypothesis that horses trot in a dynamically similar fashion at equal\nFroude number.

The first objective of\nthis study was to examine whether exposure to brackish water would lead to\nincreases in food intake, and/or conservation of nitrogen in H.\nsignifer upon daily feeding. Results obtained showed that a progressive\nincrease in ambient salinity, from 1‰ to 15‰ over a 10-day\nperiod, did not lead to an increase in daily food intake. However, there were\nsignificant reductions in daily rates of ammonia and urea excretion in H.\nsignifer during salinity changes, especially between day 5 (in 10‰\nwater) and day 10 (in 15‰ water) when compared to those of the control\nkept in 1‰ water. Consequently, there was a significant decrease in the\npercentage of nitrogen (N) from the food being excreted as nitrogenous waste\n(ammonia-N+urea-N) during this period. On day 10, the tissue urea contents in\nfish exposed to 15‰ water were significantly greater than those of fish\nkept in 1‰ water, and the excess urea-N accumulated in the former fish\ncould totally account for the cumulative deficit in excretion of\nurea-N+ammonia-N during the 10-day period. Thus, it can be concluded that\nH. signifer is N-limited, and conserved more N from food when exposed\nto brackish water. The conserved N was converted to urea, which was retained\nin tissues for osmoregulation. The second objective of this study was to\nelucidate whether the retention of the capacity of N conservation in H.\nsignifer would lead to an accumulation of urea in fish exposed to not\nonly 15‰ water, but also 1‰ water, upon feeding. For fish\npre-acclimated to 1‰ water or 15‰ water for 10 days and then\nfasted for 48 h, the rate of ammonia excretion in fish exposed to 15‰\nwater was consistently lower than that of fish exposed to 1‰ water,\nthroughout the 36-h post-feeding period. In addition, the hourly rate of urea\nexcretion in the former was significantly lower than that of the latter\nbetween hours 12 and 36. There were postprandial increases in ammonia contents\nin the muscle, liver, stomach, intestine, brain and plasma of fish kept in\n1‰ water; but postprandial increases in ammonia occurred only in the\nliver and brain of fish exposed to 15‰ water, and the magnitudes of\nincreases in the latter were smaller than those in the former. Indeed,\npostprandial increases in tissue urea contents occurred in both groups of\nfish, but the greatest increase in urea content was observed in the muscle of\nfish exposed to 15‰ water. Taken together, these results indicate that\nH. signifer in freshwater could be confronted with postprandial\nosmotic stress because of its capacity of conserving N and increasing urea\nsynthesis upon feeding."},{"title":"A comparative analysis of thermogenic capacity and cold tolerance in small birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/3/466","abstract":"Small birds showing marked seasonal changes in cold tolerance also exhibit\nwinter increases in summit metabolic rate (Msum=maximum\ncold-induced thermogenesis or thermogenic capacity) relative to summer birds.\nHowever, some birds show modest seasonal changes in cold tolerance without\nwinter increases in Msum and others exhibit large seasonal\nchanges in cold tolerance with only minor changes in Msum.\nThus, the degree of correlation between cold tolerance and\nMsum is uncertain and no interspecific study has directly\naddressed this question.

We used it to measure\nthe influence of TASK, TAIR and\nUWIN on plumage and skin temperatures in pigeons having to\ndissipate a thermal load while constrained at rest in a flight posture.Our results show that the temperature of the flight and insulation plumages\nexposed to a radiative sink can be accurately described by multiple regression\nmodels (r2>0.96) based only on\nTAIR, TASK and\nUWIN. Predictions based on these models indicate that\nwhile convection dominates heat loss for a plumage exposed to air moving at\nflight speed in a thermally uniform environment, radiation may dominate in the\npresence of a radiative sink comparable to a clear sky.Our data also indicate that reducing TASK to a\ntemperature 20°C below TAIR can increase the\ntemperature difference across the exposed plumage by at least 13% and thus\nfacilitate heat flow through the main thermal resistance to the loss of\ninternally produced heat in birds. While extrapolation from our experimentally\nconstrained conditions to free flight in the atmosphere is difficult, our\nresults suggest that the sky temperature has been a neglected factor in\ndetermining the range of TAIR over which prolonged flight\nis possible."},{"title":"Hunting archer fish match their take-off speed to distance from the future point of catch","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/1/141","abstract":"Archer fish can shoot down insect prey with a sharp jet of water. Fish\nusually fire from positions that are not directly below their target so that a\ndislodged insect falls ballistically with a horizontal velocity component.\nOnly 100 ms after the insect is on its path both the shooter and other school\nmembers can initiate a rapid turn and then head straight in the direction of\nthe later point of impact of their falling prey. The quick turn and subsequent\ntake-off are performed `open-loop', based on the initial values of the falling\ninsect's motion. We report here that archer fish can not only take off in the\ndirection of the later point of impact but also predict its distance. Distance\ninformation allows the fish to adjust their take-off speed so that they would\narrive within a narrow time slot slightly (about 50 ms) after their prey's\nimpact, despite large differences in the size of the aligning turn and in the\ndistance to be covered. Selecting a constant speed program with matched speed\nand catching the insect on the move minimizes frictional losses. The initial\nspeed of starting fish is slightly but systematically too slow and is\nincreased later so that the fish arrive 20 ms earlier than expected and often\nmake the catch on a higher than take-off speed. The variability of later speed\nchanges suggests a systematic `error' in the take-off, as if the fish\nunderestimated distance. However, this apparent deficiency seems well adapted\nto the fish catching their prey at a high speed: if later the fish had no\npossibility to correct an initial error then it is better to start slightly\ntoo slow in order to minimize the risk of overshooting the point of catch."},{"title":"Dietary choice behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/1/89","abstract":"Animals have evolved diverse behaviors that serve the purpose of finding\nfood in the environment.

Yet, we know little about the locomotor strategies used\nby animals to accomplish this while maintaining dynamic stability. In this\npaper, we perturb the running of guinea fowl with an unexpected drop in\nsubstrate height (ΔH). The drop is camouflaged to remove any\nvisual cue about the upcoming change in terrain that would allow an\nanticipatory response. To maintain stability upon a sudden drop in substrate\nheight and prevent a fall, the bird must compensate by dissipating energy or\nconverting it to another form. The aim of this paper is to investigate the\ncontrol strategies used by birds in this task. In particular, we assess the\nextent to which guinea fowl maintain body weight support and conservative\nspring-like body dynamics in the perturbed step. This will yield insight into\nhow animals integrate mechanics and control to maintain dynamic stability in\nthe face of real-world perturbations. Our results show that, despite altered\nbody dynamics and a great deal of variability in the response, guinea fowl are\nquite successful in maintaining dynamic stability, as they stumbled only once\n(without falling) in the 19 unexpected perturbations. In contrast, when the\nbirds could see the upcoming drop in terrain, they stumbled in 4 of 20 trials\n(20%, falling twice), and came to a complete stop in an additional 6 cases\n(30%). The bird's response to the unexpected perturbation fell into three\ngeneral categories: (1) conversion of vertical energy\n(EV=EP+EKv) to\nhorizontal kinetic energy (EKh), (2) absorption of\nEV through negative muscular work\n(-ΔEcom), or (3) converting EP\nto vertical kinetic energy (EKv), effectively continuing\nthe ballistic path of the animal's center of mass (COM) from the prior aerial\nphase. However, the mechanics that distinguish these categories actually occur\nalong a continuum with varying degrees of body weight support and actuation by\nthe limb, related to the magnitude and direction of the ground reaction force\n(GRF) impulse, respectively. In most cases, the muscles of the limb either\nproduced or absorbed energy during the response, as indicated by net changes\nin COM energy (Ecom). The limb likely begins stance in a\nmore retracted, extended position due to the 26 ms delay in ground contact\nrelative to that anticipated by the bird. This could explain the diminished\ndecelerating force during the first half of stance and the exchange between\nEP and EK during stance as the body\nvaults over the limb. The varying degree of weight support and energy\nabsorption in the perturbed step suggests that variation in the initial limb\nconfiguration leads to different intrinsic dynamics and reflex action. Future\ninvestigation into the limb and muscle mechanics underlying these responses\ncould yield further insight into the control mechanisms that allow such robust\ndynamic stability of running in the face of large, unexpected\nperturbations."},{"title":"Interpolation of animal tracking data in a fluid environment","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/1/128","abstract":"Interpolation of geolocation or Argos tracking data is a necessity for\nhabitat use analyses of marine vertebrates.

Given their popularity in mathematical computing,\nwe chose Bézier, hermite and cubic splines, in addition to a commonly\nused linear algorithm to interpolate data. Performance of interpolation\nmethods was compared with different temporal resolutions representative of the\nless-precise geolocation and the more-precise Argos tracking techniques.\nParameters from interpolated sub-sampled tracks were compared with those\nobtained from intact tracks. Average accuracy of the interpolated location was\nnot affected by the interpolation method and was always within the precision\nof the tracking technique used. However, depending on the species tested, some\ncurvilinear interpolation algorithms produced greater occurrences of more\naccurate locations, compared with the linear interpolation method. Total track\nlengths were consistently underestimated but were always more accurate using\ncurvilinear interpolation than linear interpolation. Curvilinear algorithms\nare safe to use because accuracy, shape and length of the tracks are either\nnot different or are slightly enhanced and because analyses always remain\nconservative. The choice of the curvilinear algorithm does not affect the\nresulting track dramatically so it should not preclude their use. We thus\nrecommend using curvilinear interpolation techniques because of the more\nrealistic fluid movements of animals.

Flies respond to directional sound sources by\nwalking in a tight curve that combines rotation and forward translation until\nthey are oriented towards the source direction, then continue on a straight\npath. Translational velocity accelerates throughout the duration of the\nstimulus then decelerates following stimulus offset. In contrast, rotational\nvelocity accelerates and then decelerates within the duration of the stimulus\nsuch that flies have completed the rotational component of the response and\nreached their final heading before the end of the stimulus. Rotational\nvelocity is the only response parameter that varies systematically with sound\nsource direction (azimuth). Differences in the amplitude of rotational\nvelocity as a function of source azimuth determine the directional orientation\nof phonotactic responses. The relationship between rotational velocity and\nsource azimuth is similar to a neural measure of auditory directionality\n(interaural latency). There were some differences between freely walking and\ntethered conditions, although both showed qualitatively similar responses.\nFlies accelerated more slowly and attained lower maximum velocities on the\ntreadmill, consistent with the greater inertia of the treadmill sphere\nrelative to the flies.

In rats, the vastus undergoes more stretching early in stance than\nshortening in later stance. In dogs, the reverse is true; more substantial\nshortening follows small amounts of initial stretching. And in horses, while\nthe vastus strain trajectory is complex, it is characterized mainly by\nshortening during stance. In this study, we use sonomicrometry and\nelectromyography to study the vastus lateralis and biceps femoris of goats,\nwith three goals in mind: (1) to see how these muscles work in comparison to\nhomologous muscles studied previously in other taxa; (2) to address how speed\nand gait impact muscle actions and (3) to test whether fascicles in different\nparts of the same muscle undergo similar length changes. Results indicate that\nthe biceps femoris undergoes substantial shortening through much of stance,\nwith higher strains in walking and trotting [32–33% resting length\n(L0)] than galloping (22% L0). These\nlength changes occur with increasing biceps EMG intensities as animals\nincrease speed from walking to galloping. The vastus undergoes a\nstretch–shorten cycle during stance. Stretching strains are higher\nduring galloping (15% L0) than walking and trotting (9%\nL0). Shortening strains follow a reverse pattern and are\ngreatest in walking (24% L0), intermediate in trotting\n(20% L0) and lowest during galloping (17%\nL0). As a result, the ratio of stretching to shortening\nincreases from below 0.5 in walking and trotting to near 1.0 during galloping.\nThis increasing ratio suggests that the vastus does relatively more positive\nwork than energy absorption at the slower speeds compared with galloping,\nalthough an understanding of the timing and magnitude of force production is\nrequired to confirm this. Length-change regimes in proximal, middle and distal\nsites of the vastus are generally comparable, suggesting strain homogeneity\nthrough the muscle. When strain rates are compared across taxa, vastus\nshortening velocities exhibit the scaling pattern predicted by theoretical and\nempirical work: fascicles shorten relatively faster in smaller animals than\nlarger animals (strain rates near 2 L s–1 have been\nreported for trotting dogs and were found here for goats, versus\n0.6–0.8 L s–1 reported in horses).\nInterestingly, biceps shortening strain rates are very similar in both goats\nand rats during walking (1–1.5 L s–1) and\ntrotting (1.5–2.5 L s–1, depending on speed of\ntrot), suggesting that the ratio of in vivo shortening velocities\n(V) to maximum shortening velocities (Vmax) is\nsmaller in small animals (because of their higher\nVmax)."},{"title":"Long-term repeatability makes basal metabolic rate a likely heritable\ntrait in the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/24/4663","abstract":"Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is a physiological trait believed to show\nadaptational changes.

Our results suggest that\nhagfishes can produce remarkable quantities of the slime because it is almost\nthree orders of magnitude more dilute than typical mucus secretions.\nMechanical experiments using whole slime produced in vitro\ndemonstrate that the slime threads dominate the slime's material properties\nand impart elasticity.

Our\nmeasurements demonstrate that the mucins are not capable of providing shear\nlinkage between threads, but this is not necessary because the threads are\nlong enough to span an entire slime mass.

We found that bees reared in social isolation have low\nlipid stores, but social inhibition occurs in colonies in the field, whether\nyoung bees are starved or fed. These results indicate that although social\ninteractions affect the nutritional status of young bees, social and\nnutritional factors act independently to influence age at onset of foraging.\nOur findings suggest that mechanisms linking internal nutritional physiology\nto foraging in solitary insects have been co-opted to regulate altruistic\nforaging in a social context."},{"title":"To DGC or not to DGC: oxygen guarding in the termite Zootermopsis\nnevadensis (Isoptera: Termopsidae)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/24/4671","abstract":"The ability of some insects to engage in complex orchestrations of tracheal\ngas exchange has been well demonstrated, but its evolutionary origin remains\nobscure.

This\nmanuscript describes a different approach to oxygen guarding in the lower\ntermite Zootermopsis nevadensis.

These layers differ in\ntheir structure, chemical composition and mechanical properties, and they\nreduce the insect attachment in different ways. The lower layer resembles\nfoam, composed of interconnected membraneous platelets protruding from the\nsurface at acute angles. The upper layer consists of densely placed separate\nirregular platelets, located perpendicular to the subjacent layer.

These morphological distinctions correlate\nwith differences in the chemical composition of waxes.

A kinematic analysis was performed from which data were used as\ninput in planar four-bar models. This analysis shows that the opercular\nmouth-opening mechanism initiates mouth opening, but is not able to cause the\ncomplete mouth openings as observed on the X-ray videos. The latter is\naccomplished through the protractor hyoidei muscles, which couple hyoid\ndepression to lower jaw depression in a four-bar system and also reinforce\nlower jaw depression by shortening during the final stage of mouth opening.\nAlthough the angulo-ceratohyal ligament was previously hypothesised to play a\npart in mouth opening, our results show that it probably does not, but rather\nfunctions as a hyoid-elevator during mouth closure. Finally, hyoid depression\nis exclusively achieved by the four-bar mechanism involving neurocranial\nelevation and pectoral girdle retraction, generally without any reinforcement\nby shortening of the sternohyoideus muscle.

This coloration is unusual in that it originates partly from\npigmentation of the abdominal skin but also from strongly pigmented gonads\ndirectly visible through the skin. In addition, females have been observed to\ntemporarily become more colourful during courtship and competition. To\nunderstand how gonad and skin pigmentation interact in this nuptial\ncoloration, the potential for colour modification via regulation of\nskin chromatophores was investigated. Noradrenaline caused aggregation of\nchromatophore pigment and was used to experimentally reduce the contribution\nof skin chromatophores to the nuptial coloration. Chromatophore pigment\naggregation caused bellies to become less colourful and abdominal skin\nbiopsies to become less colourful and more transparent. There was a strong\npositive relationship between belly coloration and the coloration of the\nunderlying gonads. This shows that belly coloration honestly reflects egg\npigmentation, mainly because the transparency of the abdominal skin allows\nother fish to see the gonads directly. Interestingly, when noradrenaline\ncaused pigment to aggregate and thereby increased the transparency of the\nskin, the relationship between belly and gonad coloration weakened.

Enhanced desiccation resistance occurred quickly,\nwithin 3 days of removal from their gall. Contrary to most previous reports, a\nlarge majority of the increased desiccation resistance (∼85%) was due to\nreduced respiratory transpiration with the remainder being the result of a\nlowered cuticular permeability. Rates of cuticular water loss were reduced by\nthe presence of a vapor pressure gradient between the larval hemolymph and\nenvironmental water vapor and were probably due to increases in cuticular\nlipids and/or production of the cryoprotectant glycerol. Metabolic rate was\nreduced by over fourfold, averaging 0.07±0.01 μl CO2\ng–1 h–1, in larvae from senescent gall\ntissue and all RH treatments compared to larvae from pre-senescent plants.

Interestingly, in the autumn both\npopulations have the same approximate level of hemolymph thermal hysteresis,\nindicative of antifreeze protein activity, suggesting that they synthesize\nsimilar amounts of antifreeze protein. A major difference is that the Alaska\nlarvae undergo extreme dehydration in winter wherein water content decreases\nfrom 63–65% body water (1.70–1.85 g H2O\ng–1 dry mass) in summer to 28–40% body water\n(0.40–0.68 g H2O g–1 dry mass) in winter.\nThese 2.5–4.6-fold reductions in body water greatly increase the\nconcentrations of antifreeze in the Alaska insects. Glycerol concentrations\nwould increase to 7–10 mol l–1 while thermal hysteresis\nincreased to nearly 13°C (the highest ever measured in any organism) in\nconcentrated hemolymph. By contrast, Indiana larvae do not desiccate in\nwinter. The Alaska population also undergoes a diapause while insects from\nIndiana do not. The result of these, and likely additional, adaptations is\nthat while the mean winter supercooling points of Indiana larvae were\napproximately –23°C, those of Alaska larvae were –35 to–\n42°C, and at certain times Alaska C. clavipes did not\nfreeze when cooled to –80°C."},{"title":"The insecticide pymetrozine selectively affects chordotonal mechanoreceptors","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/23/4451","abstract":"Pymetrozine is a neuroactive insecticide but its site of action in the\nnervous system is unknown.

This may be due partly to the preponderance of information for the\nendopterygotes, and its scarcity for the apterygotes and exopterygotes. Here\nwe undertake such a broad-scale study.

During steady swimming, dorsal fin height and sweep amplitude\ndecrease with increasing speed. The dorsal fin wake, as viewed within a\nhorizontal plane, consists of paired vortices on each side of the body (0.5\nL s–1) or nearly linearly arrayed vortex centers\nabove the body (1.0 L s–1) with central jet flows\ndirected predominately laterally (lateral:thrust force ratio=5–6). At\n2.0 L s–1, the dorsal fin is no longer recruited to\nadd momentum to the wake. This pattern of decreasing involvement of the trout\ndorsal fin in thrust production with increasing speed contrasts with the\nresults of our previous study of the soft dorsal fin of sunfish\n(Lepomis), which is hydrodynamically inactive at low speed and sheds\na propulsive vortex wake at higher speed. Yawing maneuvers by trout involve\nunilateral production of a single vortex ring by the dorsal fin with a strong\njet flow oriented almost directly laterally. During steady swimming,\ninterception by the tail of the dorsal fin's vortical wake and the adipose\nfin's non-vortical (drag) wake is hypothesized as a mechanism for enhancing\ntail thrust. This study provides the first experimental evidence that the\nplesiomorphic soft dorsal fin of ray-finned fishes acts as an ancillary force\ngenerator during axial locomotion. We suggest that the distinction often made\nbetween median and paired fin (MPF) propulsion and body and caudal fin (BCF)\npropulsion in fishes obscures the important role of multiple propulsors acting\nin a coordinated fashion. Using a combination of anterior median fin\noscillation and axial undulation, without continuous paired fin excursions,\ntrout employ an `M–BCF' gait during steady swimming. The primarily\nlateral orientation of dorsal fin force in trout induces corresponding roll\nand yaw moments, which must be countered by forces from the caudal, anal and\npaired fins. Locomotion in trout therefore involves the simultaneous active\nuse of multiple fins, presumably to maintain body stability in the face of\nenvironmental perturbations."},{"title":"Ontogeny of bone strain: the zygomatic arch in pigs","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/23/4509","abstract":"At the time of weaning, infant animals have little experience with hard\nfood, and thus their skulls are not likely to be epigenetically adapted for\nthe loads imposed by mastication.

Functional strains in piglets differed\nfrom those previously reported for older pigs in that the squamosal bone was\nnot bent in the horizontal plane and the principal tensile strain on the\nzygomatic bone did not correspond to the direction of masseter muscle pull.\nStrain patterns were more variable in piglets than in older pigs. In older\npigs, masticatory strains can be reproduced by stimulating the masseter\nmuscles. When the piglet masseter was stimulated, strain patterns were more\nsimilar to those of older pigs, but shear strain magnitudes were the largest\nyet recorded from mammalian skull bones, up to 4000 μϵ. To put these\nfindings in the context of skeletal adaptation, 45 dry skulls, including some\nanimals from the strain study, were measured.

With growth, the arch became dorsoventrally\nhigher, while mediolateral thickness decreased in the squamosal bone. Overall,\nthese changes should make strain more predictable, explaining the lower\nvariability in older animals. Other factors likely to be important in causing\nunique strain regimes in piglets include (1) unfamiliarity with hard food, (2)\ngreater importance of muscles other than the same-side masseter and (3)\ngreater proximity of molariform teeth to the arch.

Another organic alcohol, erythritol\n(CH2OH(CHOH)2CH2OH), had a similar effect,\nbut ethylene glycol (CH2OHCH2OH) did not initiate sperm\nmotility. Furthermore, this glycerol-treated sperm showed motility without\nsubsequent addition of ATP and cAMP.

The amount of intracellular\ncAMP ([cAMP]i) in glycerol-treated sperm did not increase on\nmotility activation, but a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H-89, inhibited\nglycerol-treated sperm motility. In addition, phosphorylation of protein\nassociated with motility initiation also occurred in glycerol-treated sperm,\nsuggesting that the glycerol treatment induces activation of PKA without an\nincrease in [cAMP]i.

First, the ants may employ a `goal\nexpansion strategy', using odour spread as a spatially limited indicator for\nthe presence of food. In that case, the distance steered downwind of the\nfeeder should be determined by the range of the odour plume (and, for\ninstance, wind speed).

Steering downwind by a\nmargin just exceeding their maximum navigation error will lead the ants safely\nacross the odour guide. In that case, the distance steered downwind of the\nfeeder should increase more or less linearly with the nest-feeder\ndistance.Our results unambiguously support the second strategy.

Our aim here was to characterise SALMFamide\nneuropeptides in sea urchins (class Echinoidea). Radioimmunoassays for the\nstarfish SALMFamides S1 and S2 were used to test for related peptides in\nwhole-body acetone extracts of the sea urchin Echinus esculentus.\nFractionation of extracts using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\nrevealed several peaks of SALMFamide-like immunoreactivity, with two S2-like\nimmunoreactive peaks (3 and 4) being the most prominent. However, peak 4 could\nnot be purified to homogeneity and although peak 3 was purified, only a\npartial sequence (MRYH) could be obtained.An alternative strategy for identification of echinoid SALMFamides was\nprovided by sequencing the genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus\npurpuratus. Analysis of whole-genome shotgun sequence data using the\nBasic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) identified a contig (347664) that\ncontains a coding region for seven putative SALMFamide neuropeptides\n(PPVTTRSKFTFamide, DAYSAFSFamide, GMSAFSFamide, AQPSFAFamide, GLMPSFAFamide,\nPHGGSAFVFamide and GDLAFAFamide), which we have named SpurS1-SpurS7,\nrespectively. Three of these peptides (SpurS1-3) have the C-terminal sequences\nTFamide or SFamide, which are identical or similar to the C-terminal region of\nthe starfish SALMFamide S2. This may explain the occurrence of several S2-like\nimmunoreactive peptides in extracts of Echinus esculentus.Detailed analysis of the sequence of contig 347664 indicated that the\nSALMFamide gene in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus comprises two exons,\nwith the first exon encoding a signal peptide sequence and the second exon\nencoding SpurS1-SpurS7. Characterisation of this gene is important because it\nis the first echinoderm neuropeptide precursor sequence to be identified and,\nmore specifically, it provides our first insight into the structure and\norganisation of a SALMFamide gene in an echinoderm. In particular, it has\nrevealed a hitherto unknown complexity in the diversity of SALMFamide\nneuropeptides that may occur in an echinoderm species because all previous\nstudies, which relied on peptide purification and sequencing, revealed only\ntwo SALMFamide neuropeptides in each species examined.

Although not supported by any direct\nevidence, the enhancement of PO2 is considered\nto be related to the Root effect, the release upon acidification of Hb-bound\nO2 into physical dissolution, possibly supported by counter-current\nmultiplication similar to the loop of Henle.The present study evaluates the magnitude of intraocular\nPO2 enhancement under tightly controlled\nphysiological conditions, to directly confirm the involvement of the Root\neffect on intraocular PO2 in the retina of\nrainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Intraocular\nPO2 was determined with special polarographic\nmicroelectrodes inserted into the eye. PO2\nprofiles established in vivo by driving electrodes through the entire\nretina yielded average PO2 values between 10\nmmHg (1.3 kPa) at the inner retinal surface and 382 mmHg (50.9 kPa) close to\nthe outer retinal limit (Bruch's membrane). According to estimates on the\nbasis of the diffusion distances determined from sections of the retina\n(∼436 μm at the site of PO2 measurement)\nand literature data on specific oxygen consumption, the in vivo\ndetermined values would be sufficient to cover the oxygen demand of the retina\nwith some safety margin.For a clear and direct in-tissue-test as to the involvement of the Root\neffect, an isolated in vitro eye preparation was established in order\nto avoid the problem of indirect blood supply to the eye from the dorsal aorta\nonly via the pseudobranch, a hemibranch thought to modulate blood\ncomposition before entry of the eye.

This may be due to the design of the reward\nschedule, which can be fixed (e.g. 20 units effort required for each reward)\nor variable (e.g. each unit effort rewarded with probability 1/20). Most\nstudies used fixed reward rates, but foraging motivation is generally higher\nfor variable reward rates, and the only study in which animals increased DEE\nwhen intake rate decreased used variable reward rates. To assess the\ngenerality of this result, we exposed zebra finches Taeniopygia\nguttata to different intake rates using variable reward rates.\nWe decreased intake rate by mixing 25 g of seeds with 0, 25 or 75 g of chaff.\nWith increasing chaff/seed ratio the time spent foraging increased from 6% to\n27%, but this was insufficient to compensate for the lower intake rate,\nbecause DEE decreased by 6.6%.

The decrease in DEE in adverse conditions\nraises the question of what prevents such behaviour in benign\ncircumstances.We hypothesize that energy is saved at the expense of `condition', and we\ntested this hypothesis in two ways. Firstly, we tested the effect of intake\nrate on the replacement of two plucked tail feathers (a form of somatic\nrepair). Replacement feathers were shorter when intake rate was low,\nindicating an effect of intake rate on somatic repair ability. Secondly, we\ntested for carry-over effects of intake rate on reproduction, by giving pairs\nthe opportunity to reproduce with access ad libitum to food after\nfeeding on one of the three chaff/seed ratios for 6 weeks.

The\nrelevance of this approach to free-living animals is questionable, however,\nbecause under natural conditions low food availability often results in higher\nforaging costs, and everything else remaining equal this results in a higher\nenergy budget. We manipulated food availability by varying the foraging costs\nand studied effects on daily energy expenditure (DEE) and energy allocation of\ncaptive starlings Sturnus vulgaris. Birds in a closed economy earned\ntheir food by flying between two perches 5 m apart.

Taken together, the results suggest that bees assign\nappropriate significance to odometric and landmark cues in a more flexible and\ndynamic way than previously envisaged."},{"title":"Determination of pH by microfluorometry: intracellular and interstitial\npH regulation in developing early-stage fish embryos (Danio\nrerio)","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/21/4137","abstract":"Microfluorometric techniques were applied in vivo for continuous\nmonitoring of specific acid-base parameters in zebrafish (Danio\nrerio) embryos during early stages of ontogeny. Dextran-coupled\npH-sensitive single-excitation/dual-emission dye SNARF-1 was pressure-injected\ninto individual cells or the interstitial space of 16- to 256-cell embryos,\nand pH was continuously recorded during subsequent development for time\nperiods of up to 8 h. A novel calibration technique was developed, essentially\ncharacterized by in vitro inorganic buffer calibration of the optical\nsystem and mathematical post-processing according to the effects of in\nvivo dye modifiers through a correlation established by direct comparison\nof optical techniques with pH microelectrodes. This approach results in high\naccuracy of microfluorometry, comparable with that of pH electrodes, and a\nrecovery only limited by the physical stability of the utilized optical\nsystem.Intracellular pH (pHi) in Danio rerio embryos between\n1k-cells stage and the end of epiboly was found to be well regulated to a mean\nvalue of 7.55±0.13 (± s.d.), a range\ndistinctly more alkaline than typical values for adult fish but in accordance\nwith embryonic pHi of a few non-fish species shortly after\nfertilization. Also, interstitial pH (pHint) was significantly\nhigher (8.08±0.25) than values for extracellular pH in adult fish.\nDistributions of HCO3- across membranes and between\ninterstitium and ambient fluid compared with respective potentials strongly\nsuggest that pH in these early stages of ontogeny is already adjusted by\nactive transfer processes. Non-respiratory changes in ambient pH between 7.7\nand 8.5 did not significantly affect pHi, a result potentially\nattributable to low membrane leakage rate or to the potency of active transfer\nmechanisms. In order to assess the pH regulatory systems more quantitatively,\nembryos were exposed to ambient changes of carbon dioxide partial pressure\n(PCO2). The direct impact of PCO2\nchanges on cell pH was alleviated by cell non-bicarbonate buffering and\nsubsequent rapid, almost complete, compensation by changes in cell\n[HCO3-] as an expression of transmembrane transfer of\nacid-base relevant ions. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the\nregulatory potency of embryonic cells is well developed, is active to resist\nextensive homoiostatic stress and is efficient to maintain critical metabolism\nin adverse conditions, even at early stages of ontogeny."},{"title":"Retinoid cycles in the cone-dominated chicken retina","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/21/4151","abstract":"In past decades, the role of retinoids in support of rod photopigment\nregeneration has been extensively characterized. In the rhodopsin cycle,\nretinal chromophore from bleached rod pigments is reduced to retinol and\ntransferred to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to store as\nall-trans retinyl ester. This ester pool is subsequently utilized for\nvisual pigment regeneration. However, there is a lack of information on the\nputative cone visual cycle. In the present study, we provide experimental\nevidence in support of a novel retinoid cycle for cone photopigment\nregeneration. In the cone-rich chicken, light exposure resulted in the\naccumulation of 11-cis retinyl esters to the retina and\nall-trans retinyl esters to the RPE. Both the rate of increase and\nthe amount of 11-cis retinyl esters in the retina far exceeded those\nof the all-trans retinyl esters in the RPE. In response to dark\nadaptation, this 11-cis retinyl ester pool in the retina depletes at\na rate several times faster than the all-trans retinyl ester pool in\nthe RPE. In vitro, isolated, dark-adapted retinas devoid of RPE show\nboth an accumulation of 11-cis retinyl ester and a concomitant\nreduction of 11-cis retinal chromophore in response to light\nexposure. Finally, we provide experimental results to elucidate a cone visual\ncycle in chicken by relating the change in retinoids (retinal and retinyl\nester) with time during light and dark adaptation. Our results support a new\nparadigm for cone photopigment regeneration in which the 11-cis\nretinyl ester pool in the retina serves as the primary source of visual\nchromophore for cone pigment regeneration."},{"title":"The contribution of tympanic transmission to fine temporal signal evaluation in an ultrasonic moth","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/21/4159","abstract":"In lesser waxmoths Achroia grisella, pair formation and female\nmate choice involve very fine discrimination of male ultrasonic signals.\nFemale A. grisella prefer male signals with longer pulses and longer\n`asynchrony intervals', and evaluate differences in these characteristics in\nthe range of 80-260 μs.

Two different responses were recorded after a long-term\nfreshwater acclimatization. (1) Successfully adapted sea-bass displayed\nstandard behavior; their blood osmolality was maintained almost constant after\nthe freshwater challenge, attesting to their efficient hyperosmoregulation.\nTheir branchial and renal Na+/K+-ATPase abundance and\nactivity were high compared to seawater fish due to a high number of branchial\nionocytes and to the involvement of the urinary system in active ion\nreabsorption, producing hypotonic urine.

Their blood osmolality was low (30% lower than in the successfully\nadapted sea-bass), which is a sign of acute osmoregulatory failure. High\nbranchial Na+/K+-ATPase abundance and activity compared\nto successfully adapted fish were coupled to a proliferation of gill chloride\ncells, whose ultrastructure did not display pathological signs.

Underwater they swim by paddling with both feet\nsimultaneously in a gait that includes long glides between consecutive\nstrokes. At shallow swimming depths the birds are highly buoyant as a\nconsequence of their aerial lifestyle. To counter this buoyancy cormorants\nswim underwater with their body at an angle to the swimming direction. This\nmechanical solution for foraging at shallow depth is expected to increase the\ncost of swimming by increasing the drag of the birds. We used kinematic\nanalysis of video sequences of cormorants swimming underwater at shallow depth\nin a controlled research setup to analyze the swimming gait and estimate the\nresultant drag of the birds during the entire paddling cycle. The gliding drag\nof the birds was estimated from swimming speed deceleration during the glide\nstage while the drag during active paddling was estimated using a mathematical\n`burst-and-glide' model. The model was originally developed to estimate the\nenergetic saving from combining glides with burst swimming and we used this\nfact to test whether the paddling gait of cormorants has similar\nadvantages.We found that swimming speed was correlated with paddling frequency\n(r=0.56, P<0.001, N=95) where the increase in\npaddling frequency was achieved mainly by shortening the glide stage\n(r=–0.86, P<0.001, N=95). The drag\ncoefficient of the birds during paddling was higher on average by two- to\nthreefold than during gliding. However, the magnitude of the drag coefficient\nduring the glide was positively correlated with the tilt of the body\n(r=0.5, P<0.003, N=35) and negatively correlated\nwith swimming speed (r=–0.65, P<0.001,\nN=35), while the drag coefficient during the stroke was not\ncorrelated with tilt of the body (r=–0.11, P>0.5,\nN=35) and was positively correlated with swimming speed\n(r=0.41, P<0.015, N=35). Therefore, the\ndifference between the drag coefficient during the glide and during propulsion\ndiminished at lower speeds and larger tilt. The mean drag of the birds for a\nsingle paddling cycle at an average swimming speed of 1.5 m\ns–1 was 5.5±0.68 N. The burst-and-glide model predicts\nthat energy saving from using burst-and-glide in the paddling cycle is limited\nto relatively fast swimming speeds (>1.5 m s–1), but that\nas the birds dive deeper (>1 m where buoyancy is reduced), the\nburst-and-glide gait may become beneficial even at lower speeds."},{"title":"The modulus of elasticity of fibrillin-containing elastic fibres in the\nmesoglea of the hydromedusa Polyorchis penicillatus","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/20/3819","abstract":"Hydromedusan jellyfish swim by rhythmic pulsation of their mesogleal bells.\nA single swimming muscle contracts to create thrust by ejecting water from the\nsubumbrellar cavity.

To analyse the properties of the MTUs, all subjects\nperformed isometric maximal voluntary (MVC) ankle plantarflexion and knee\nextension contractions at 11 different MTU lengths on a dynamometer. The\nactivation of the TS and QF during MVC was estimated by surface\nelectromyography. The gastrocnemius medialis and the vastus lateralis and\ntheir distal aponeuroses were visualized by ultrasonography at rest and during\nMVC, respectively. Ground reaction forces and kinematic data were recorded\nduring running trials at 2.7 m s–1.The TS and QF MTU capacities were reduced with aging (lower muscle strength\nand lower tendon stiffness). Runners and non-active subjects had similar MTU\nproperties, suggesting that chronic endurance-running exercise does not\ncounteract the age-related degeneration of the MTUs. Runners showed a higher\nmechanical advantage for the QF MTU while running (lower gear ratio) compared\nto non-active subjects, indicating a task-specific adaptation even at old age.\nOlder adults reacted to the reduced capacities of their MTUs by increasing\nrunning safety (higher duty factor, lower flight time) and benefitting from a\nmechanical advantage for the TS MTU, lower rate of force generation and force\ngeneration per meter distance. We suggest that the improvement in running\nmechanics in the older adults happens due to a perceptual motor recalibration\nand a feed-forward adaptation of the motor task aimed at decreasing the\ndisparity between the reduced capacity of the MTUs and the running effort."},{"title":"Unconventional mechanisms control cyclic respiratory gas release in\nflying Drosophila","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/19/3645","abstract":"The high power output of flight muscles places special demands on the\nrespiratory gas exchange system in insects.

By contrast, under certain conditions, instantaneous release rate of\ncarbon dioxide from the fruit fly Drosophila flying in a\nvirtual-reality flight arena may oscillate distinctly at low frequency\n(0.37±0.055 Hz), even though flight muscle mechanical power output\nrequires constant metabolic activity. Cross-correlation analysis suggests that\nthis uncoupling between respiratory and metabolic rate is not driven by\nconventional types of convective flow reinforcement such as abdominal pumping,\nbut might result from two unusual mechanisms for tracheal breathing.\nSimplified analytical modeling of diffusive tracheal gas exchange suggests\nthat cyclic release patterns in the insect occur as a consequence of the\nstochastically synchronized control of spiracle opening area by the four large\nthoracic spiracles. Alternatively, in-flight motion analysis of the abdomen\nand proboscis using infra-red video imaging suggests utilization of the\nproboscis extension reflex (PER) for tracheal convection.

Here we examine the magnitude and relative contribution\nof the impact and cavitation forces generated by the peacock mantis shrimp\nOdontodactylus scyllarus. We present the surprising finding that each\nstrike generates two brief, high-amplitude force peaks, typically\n390–480 μs apart. Based on high-speed imaging, force measurements and\nacoustic analyses, it is evident that the first force peak is caused by the\nlimb's impact and the second force peak is due to the collapse of cavitation\nbubbles. Peak limb impact forces range from 400 to 1501 N and peak cavitation\nforces reach 504 N. Despite their small size, O. scyllarus can\ngenerate impact forces thousands of times their body weight. Furthermore, on\naverage, cavitation peak forces are 50% of the limb's impact force, although\ncavitation forces may exceed the limb impact forces by up to 280%. The rapid\nsuccession of high peak forces used by mantis shrimp suggests that mantis\nshrimp use a potent combination of cavitation forces and extraordinarily high\nimpact forces to fracture shells.

The method was used to analyse the\ninfluence of RBC perfusion on myocardial O2 supply and\nO2 consumption and to test the hypothesis that nitrite is converted\nto vasoactive nitric oxide in the RBC-perfused coronary circulation. Perfusion\nwith RBCs significantly increased myocardial O2 supply and\nO2 consumption by increasing the incoming O2\nconcentration and the O2 extraction. Coronary flow did not differ\nbetween RBC perfusion and saline perfusion, but RBC perfusion established a\nstrong linear increase in myocardial O2 consumption with coronary\nflow. Nitric oxide was measured in the atrial effluent of the preparation.\nPerfusion with saline under hypoxic conditions was associated with NO\nproduction. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NA obliterated this NO\nproduction and significantly decreased coronary flow, showing that the NO was\nvasoactive and probably of endothelial origin. RBC perfusion at low\nPO2 similarly caused an L-NA-inhibitable NO\nproduction. The change in NO production upon subsequent nitrite addition, by\ncontrast, was not inhibited by L-NA. Nitrite entered trout erythrocytes\nindependent of degree of oxygenation, but the O2 saturation of RBCs\nshowed a major decrease in the coronary circulation, and\n[NO2-] decreased while methaemoglobin rose, suggesting\nthat deoxyHb-mediated reduction of nitrite to NO may have occurred.

In nicb107 mutant embryos, muscle fibres\nare mechanically intact and able to contract, but neuronal signalling is\ndefective and the fibres are not activated, rendering the embryos immobile.\nDespite the immobility, distinguished slow and fast muscle fibres developed at\nthe correct location in the axial muscles, helical muscle fibre arrangements\nwere detected and sarcomere architecture was generated. However, in\nnicb107 mutant embryos the notochord is flatter and the\ncross-sectional body shape more rounded, also affecting muscle fibre\norientation. The stacking of sarcomeres and myofibril arrangement show a less\nregular pattern. Finally, expression levels of several genes were changed.\nTogether, these changes in expression indicate that muscle growth is not\nimpeded and energy metabolism is not changed by the decrease in muscle\nactivity but that the composition of muscle is altered. In addition, skin\nstiffness is affected.

The pit bulls exhibited lower stresses at yield, had lower elastic\nmoduli and failed at much higher levels of work. The stiffness of the tissue\nof the humerus, radius, femur and tibia was 1.5-2.4-fold greater in the\ngreyhounds than in the pit bulls. These bones from the pit bulls absorbed\n1.9-2.6-fold more energy before failure than did those of the greyhounds.\nThese differences between breeds were not observed in the long bones of the\nfeet, metacarpals and metatarsals.

It was therefore suggested that cormorants\nmight employ a behavioural strategy to reduce daily energy expenditure by\nminimizing the amount of time spent in water. However, European shags\n(Phalacrocorax aristotelis) have been observed to spend up to 7 h\nday-1 diving in water of around 5-6°C. To gain a better\nunderstanding of the energetic requirements in European shags, we measured\ntheir metabolic rates when resting in air/water and during shallow diving\nusing respirometry. To investigate the effects of water temperature and\nfeeding status on metabolic rate, birds dived at water temperatures ranging\nfrom 5 to 13°C in both post-absorptive and absorptive states. In parallel\nwith respirometry, stomach temperature loggers were deployed to monitor body\ntemperature. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) was almost identical to\nallometric predictions at 4.73 W kg-1. Metabolic rate when resting\non water, during diving and after feeding was significantly elevated when\ncompared with the resting-in-air rate. During diving, the metabolic rate of\npost-absorptive shags increased to 22.66 W kg-1, which corresponds\nto 4.8× BMR. Minimum cost of transport (COT) was\ncalculated at 17.8 J kg-1 m-1 at a swim speed of 1.3 m\ns-1. Feeding before diving elevated diving metabolic rate by 13%\nfor up to 5 h. There was a significant relationship between diving metabolic\nrate and water temperature, where metabolic rate increased as water\ntemperature declined. Thermal conductance when resting in air at 10-19°C\nwas 2.05 W m-2 °C-1 and quadrupled during diving\n(7.88 W m-2 °C-1). Stomach temperature when resting\nin air during the day was 40.6°C and increased during activity. In dive\ntrials lasting up to 50 min, stomach temperature fluctuated around a peak\nvalue of 42.0°C. Hence, there is no evidence that European shags might\nemploy a strategy of regional hypothermia. The energetic costs during shallow\ndiving in European shags are considerably lower than has previously been\nreported for great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) and are\ncomparable to other foot-propelled divers. The lower dive costs in shags might\nbe the consequence of a more streamlined body shape reducing hydrodynamic\ncosts as well as a greater insulative plumage air layer (estimated to be 2.71\nmm), which reduces thermoregulatory costs. The latter might be of great\nimportance for shags especially during winter when they spend extended periods\nforaging in cold water."},{"title":"Variable rewards and discrimination ability in an insect herbivore: what and how does a hungry locust learn?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/18/3463","abstract":"With the exception of honeybees, there have been few good invertebrate\nmodels for associative learning.

Hence, properties of the wake\nare commonly studied in experiments to infer the magnitude and direction of\nlocomotive forces. The determination of which wake properties are necessary\nand sufficient to empirically deduce swimming and flying forces is currently\nmade ad hoc. This paper systematically addresses the question of the\nminimum number of wake properties whose combination is sufficient to determine\nswimming and flying forces from wake measurements. In particular, it is\nconfirmed that the spatial velocity distribution (i.e. the velocity field) in\nthe wake is by itself insufficient to determine swimming and flying forces,\nand must be combined with the fluid pressure distribution. Importantly, it is\nalso shown that the spatial distribution of rotation and shear (i.e. the\nvorticity field) in the wake is by itself insufficient to determine swimming\nand flying forces, and must be combined with a parameter that is analogous to\nthe fluid pressure. The measurement of this parameter in the wake is shown to\nbe identical to a calculation of the added-mass contribution from fluid\nsurrounding vortices in the wake, and proceeds identically to a measurement of\nthe added-mass traditionally associated with fluid surrounding solid bodies.\nIt is demonstrated that the velocity/pressure perspective is equivalent to the\nvorticity/vortex-added-mass approach in the equations of motion. A model is\ndeveloped to approximate the contribution of wake vortex added-mass to\nlocomotive forces, given a combination of velocity and vorticity field\nmeasurements in the wake. A dimensionless parameter, the wake vortex ratio\n(denoted Wa), is introduced to predict the types of wake flows for which the\ncontribution of forces due to wake vortex added-mass will become\nnon-negligible. Previous wake analyses are re-examined in light of this\nparameter to infer the existence and importance of wake vortex added-mass in\nthose cases. In the process, it is demonstrated that the commonly used\ntime-averaged force estimates based on wake measurements are not sufficient to\nprove that an animal is generating the locomotive forces necessary to sustain\nflight or maintain neutral buoyancy."},{"title":"Are hearing sensitivities of freshwater fish adapted to the ambient noise in their habitats?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/18/3533","abstract":"Several groups of fishes, among them two thirds of all freshwater fishes,\nhave developed hearing specializations that enhance auditory sensitivity and\nbroaden frequency ranges compared with hearing non-specialists (generalists),\nwhich lack such adaptations.

Since the movement patterns\nare considered very similar to the basic feeding behaviour in neognathous\nbirds it is concluded that the specific morphology of the PPC is not the\nresult of specific functional demands from palaeognathous feeding\nbehaviour."},{"title":"Hind limb proportions and kinematics: are small primates different from other small mammals?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/17/3367","abstract":"Similar in body size, locomotor behaviour and morphology to the last common\nancestor of Primates, living small quadrupedal primates provide a convenient\nmodel for investigating the evolution of primate locomotion. In this study,\nthe hind limb kinematics of quadrupedal walking in mouse lemurs, brown lemurs,\ncotton-top tamarins and squirrel monkeys are analysed using cineradiography.\nThe scaling of hind limb length to body size and the intralimb proportions of\nthe three-segmented hind limb are taken into consideration when kinematic\nsimilarities and differences are discussed.Hind limb kinematics of arboreal quadrupedal primates, ranging in size\nbetween 100 g and 3000 g, are size independent and resemble the hind limb\nkinematics of small non-cursorial mammals. A common feature seen in smaller\nmammals, in general, is the horizontal position of the thigh at touchdown and\nof the lower leg at lift-off. Thus, the maximum bone length is immediately\ntransferred into the step length. The vertical position of the leg at the\nbeginning of a step cycle and of the thigh at lift-off contributes the same\ndistance to pivot height. Step length and pivot height increase proportionally\nwith hind limb length, because intralimb proportions of the hind limb remain\nfairly constant. Therefore, the strong positive allometric scaling of the hind\nlimb in arboreal quadrupedal primates affects neither the kinematics of hind\nlimb segments nor the total angular excursion of the limb. The angular\nexcursion of the hind limb in quadrupedal primates is equal to that of other\nnon-cursorial mammals. Hence, hind limb excursion in larger cercopithecine\nprimates differs from that of other large mammals due to the decreasing\nangular excursion as part of convergent cursorial adaptations in several\nphylogenetic lineages of mammals. Typical members of those phylogenetic groups\nare traditionally used in comparison with typical primates, and therefore the\n`uniqueness' of primate locomotor characteristics is often overrated."},{"title":"Cranial kinesis in palaeognathous birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/17/3409","abstract":"Cranial kinesis in birds is induced by muscles located caudal on the\ncranium.

In palaeognathous birds\nthe morphology of the PPC is remarkably different from that of neognathous\nbirds and is thought to be related to the specific type of cranial kinesis in\npalaeognaths known as central rhynchokinesis.

We found that no clear bending\nzones are present in the upper bill, and bending is expected to occur over the\nwhole length of the upper bill. Muscle forces are more than sufficient to\novercome bending forces and to elevate the upper bill. The resistance against\nbending by the bony elements alone is very low, which might indicate that\nbending of bony elements can occur during food handling when muscles are not\nused to stabilise the upper bill. Model calculations suggest that the large\nprocessi basipterygoidei play a role in stabilizing the skull elements, when\nbirds have to resist external opening forces on the upper bill as might occur\nduring tearing leafs from plants.

The muscle-mass-specific peak power output\nduring jumping was nearly 800 W kg–1, which is more than\ntwice the peak isotonic power estimated for guinea fowl leg muscles.

Several findings,\nsummarized here, provide indirect evidence that discrimination is based on a\ncue located at the shapes' boundaries. In the present study, we test this\nhypothesis directly in two different ways. (1) Three groups of bees are each\ntrained with a different pair of convex shapes, one positive (rewarding), the\nother not (negative), producing colour contrast, luminance contrast or motion\ncontrast against the background. The trained bees are then offered a choice\nbetween pairs of stimuli whose shapes are identical to those of the training\nshapes, but whose contrast against the background is varied by changing the\npattern, the colour or the luminance of the areas. The results show that bees\ndiscriminate between the pairs of novel shapes, i.e. they generalize the\nshapes among the different types of contrast, revealing that they use a\nparticular cue extracted from the positive shape. The bees' choices between a\nstimulus that produces the correct contrast but has the wrong shape and one\nthat possesses the correct shape but the wrong contrast show, in addition,\nthat the relevant cue is not located within the area of the shape.

This increase in architectural\ngear ratio (AGR = longitudinal strain/fiber strain) is mediated by muscle\nfiber rotation; the higher the initial fiber angle, the more the fibers rotate\nduring contraction and the higher the AGR. Muscle fiber rotation is\nadditionally impacted by bulging in the dorsoventral (DV) and/or mediolateral\n(ML) dimensions during longitudinal segment shortening.

All three had highly conserved catalytic (dII)\nand C2-like (dIII) domains. Gl-CalpB was classified as a typical,\nor EF-hand, calpain, as the deduced amino acid sequence had a calmodulin-like\ndomain IV in the C-terminus and was most similar to Drosophila\ncalpains A and B. Based on its estimated mass (∼88.9 kDa) and\ncross-immunoreactivity with a polyclonal antibody raised against Dm-CalpA,\nGl-CalpB may encode CDP IIb, which is a homodimer of a 95-kDa subunit. It was\nexpressed in all tissues examined, including skeletal muscle, heart,\nintegument, gill, digestive gland, hindgut, nerve ganglia, gonads and Y-organ\n(molting gland). Both Gl-CalpM and Gl-CalpT were classified as atypical, or\nnon-EF-hand, calpains, as they lacked a domain IV sequence.

Within the limitations of the\nrobotic apparatus, the clap-and-fling augmented total lift production by up to\n17%, but depended strongly on stroke kinematics. The time course of the\ninteraction between the wings was quite complex. For example, wing interaction\nattenuated total force during the initial part of the wing clap, but slightly\nenhanced force at the end of the clap phase. We measured two temporally\ntransient peaks of both lift and drag enhancement during the fling phase: a\nprominent peak during the initial phase of the fling motion, which accounts\nfor most of the benefit in lift production, and a smaller peak of force\nenhancement at the end fling when the wings started to move apart. A detailed\ndigital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) analysis during clap-and-fling\nshowed that the most obvious effect of the bilateral `image' wing on flow\noccurs during the early phase of the fling, due to a strong fluid influx\nbetween the wings as they separate. The DPIV analysis revealed, moreover, that\ncirculation induced by a leading edge vortex (LEV) during the early fling\nphase was smaller than predicted by inviscid two-dimensional analytical\nmodels, whereas circulation of LEV nearly matched the predictions of\nWeis-Fogh's inviscid model at late fling phase. In addition, the presence of\nthe image wing presumably causes subtle modifications in both the wake capture\nand viscous forces. Collectively, these effects explain some of the changes in\ntotal force and lift production during the fling.

In this paper we examine the effect of bottlenecks on the\ntemporal organization of ant flow. In our experiments ants had to cross a\nbridge to go from their nest to a food source. Two types of bridges were used:\none with and one without bottlenecks. Traffic counts show that, in spite of\nthe bottlenecks and the reduction of path width, the volume of traffic and the\nrate of food return were the same on both bridges. This was due to a change in\nthe temporal organization of the flow: when path width decreases alternating\nclusters of inbound and outbound ants were observed crossing the bridge. This\norganization limits the number of head-on encounters and thus allows to\nmaintain the same travel duration as on the wide bridge. A model is proposed\nto assess in various conditions the importance of the behavioural rules\nobserved at the individual level for the regulation of traffic flow.

We found that dorsal and anal fins begin\noscillating, in phase, at steady swimming speeds above 1.0 TL\ns–1 and that maximum lateral displacement of the trailing\nedge of the fins as well as fin area increase with increasing steady swimming\nspeed. Differences in area, lateral displacement and moment arm between the\ndorsal and anal fin suggest that dorsal and anal fins produce balancing\ntorques during steady swimming.

Quasi-steady mechanisms could\naccount for nearly all of the mean measured force required to hover, although\ntemporal discrepancies between instantaneous measured forces and model\npredictions indicate that unsteady mechanisms also play a significant role. We\nanalyzed the requirements for hovering from an analysis of the time history of\nforces and moments in all six degrees of freedom. The wing kinematics\nnecessary to generate sufficient lift are highly constrained by the\nrequirement to balance thrust and pitch torque over the stroke cycle. We also\ncompare the wing motion and aerodynamic forces of free and tethered flies.\nTethering causes a strong distortion of the stroke pattern that results in a\nreduction of translational forces and a prominent nose-down pitch moment. The\nstereotyped distortion under tethered conditions is most likely due to a\ndisruption of sensory feedback. Finally, we calculated flight power based\ndirectly on the measurements of wing motion and aerodynamic forces, which\nyielded a higher estimate of muscle power during free hovering flight than\nprior estimates based on time-averaged parameters. This discrepancy is mostly\ndue to a two- to threefold underestimate of the mean profile drag coefficient\nin prior studies. We also compared our values with the predictions of the same\ntime-averaged models using more accurate kinematic and aerodynamic input\nparameters based on our high-speed videography measurements. In this case, the\ntime-averaged models tended to overestimate flight costs."},{"title":"Effect of an increase in gravity on the power output and the rebound of the body in human running","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/12/2333","abstract":"The effect of an increase in gravity on the mechanics of running has been\nstudied by using a force platform fixed to the floor of an aircraft undergoing\nflight profiles, resulting in a simulated gravity of 1.3 g. The power\nspent to maintain the motion of the centre of mass of the body is ∼1.3\ntimes greater than on Earth, due to a similar increase of both the power spent\nagainst gravity and to sustain the forward speed changes. This indicates that\nthe average vertical displacement per unit distance and the average direction\nof the push are unchanged. The increase in power is mainly due to an increase\nin step frequency rather than to an increase in the work done at each step.\nThe increase in step frequency in turn is mainly due to a decreased duration\nof the effective aerial phase (when the vertical force is less than body\nweight), rather than an increase in the stiffness of the bouncing system. The\nmaximal speed where step frequency can match the resonant frequency of the\nbouncing system is increased by ∼5 km h–1 at 1.3\ng.

The convective performance and oxygen-sensitive control of the\nventilatory and circulatory systems were the same in both acclimation groups.\nThe Hb concentration and oxygen affinity increased by 266% and 32%,\nrespectively.

Similarly to other L-type channels, EGL-19 activates at\nhigh voltages and inactivates slowly; thus it may maintain the plateau phase\nof the action potential. EXP-2 is a potassium channel of the kV family that\nshows inward rectifier properties when expressed in Xenopus laevis\noocytes. We show that endogenous EXP-2 is not a true inward rectifier - it\nconducts large outward currents at potentials up to +20 mV and is therefore\nwell suited to trigger rapid repolarization at the end of the action potential\nplateau phase.

Here, we test this assumption combining\nstate-of-the-art knowledge of bee vision and behavioural experiments.In the field, yellow spiders are only found on yellow daisies\n(Chrysanthemum frutescens), whereas white spiders are found on yellow\nand white daisies. These field patterns were confirmed in the laboratory.

In the ballistic dive, the snake changed posture from generally\nstraight to a wide `S' shape in planview and began aerial undulation. Shortly\nafter the ballistic dive, the snake's speed transitioned from an initial\nacceleration to stable or to a different rate of increase or decrease. Aerial\nundulation, in which high-amplitude traveling waves pass posteriorly down the\nbody, was a prominent locomotor behavior. In mid-glide, this undulation\noccurred with the anterior body oriented approximately parallel with the\nground and the posterior body cycling up and down in the vertical plane.

Conversely, bat attack sequences that contain rapid\nincreases in PRR close to the point of capture could circumvent the mantid's\nauditory defense.

What are the proximate mechanisms that\ntrigger the 'decisions' to submerge and return to the surface? The present\nstudy proposes a model intended to address this question, based on fundamental\nconcepts of cardiorespiratory control. Two basic hypotheses are examined by\ncomputer simulation, using a mathematical model of the mammalian\ncardiorespiratory control system with parameter values for an adult Weddell\nseal: (1) that the control of diving can be considered to be a respiratory\ncontrol problem, and (2) that dives are initiated and maintained by\ndisfacilitation of respiratory drive, not inhibition. Computer simulations\nconfirmed the plausibility of these hypotheses. Simulated diving behaviour and\nphysiological responses (ventilation, cardiac output, blood and tissue gas\ntensions) were consistent with published data from freely diving Weddell\nseals. Dives up to the estimated aerobic dive limit (ADL, 18-25 min) could be\nsimulated without the need for active inhibition of breathing in this model.\nThis theoretical analysis suggests that the most important physiological\nadjustments occur during the surface interval phase of the dive cycle and\ninclude hyperventilation accompanied by high cardiac output, appropriate\nregulation of cerebral blood flow and central chemoreceptor threshold shifts.\nDuring dives, cardiac output, distribution of peripheral blood flow, splenic\ncontraction and peripheral chemoreflex drives were found to modulate\nphysiological and behavioural responses, but were not essential for simulated\ndives to occur. The main conclusion from this study is that the central\nchemoreceptor may be an important mechanism involved in the regulation of\ndiving behaviour, implying that CO2, not O2, is the key\nregulatory variable in this model.

ITM, which persists\nfor 2–3 h, is dependent only on de novo protein synthesis,\nwhilst LTM persists for up to 4 weeks and is dependent on both transcription\nand de novo protein synthesis. We found that although the behavioural\nphenotype of ITM was not apparent 24 h after the last training session, a\nresidual memory trace was present that serves as a foundation upon which a\nsubsequent ITM-training-procedure builds on to form LTM (i.e. a `changed\nmemory').

The viewing\nstrategies during pursuit behaviour of blowflies appear to be very similar to\neye movements during pursuit in primates: a combination of smooth pursuit and\ncatch-up saccades. Whereas in primates these two components of pursuit eye\nmovements are thought to be controlled by distinct oculomotor subsystems, we\npresent evidence that in blowflies both types of pursuit responses can be\nproduced by a single control system. In numerical simulations of chasing\nbehaviour the proposed control system generates qualitatively the same\nbehaviour as with real blowflies. As a consequence of time constants in the\ncontrol system, mimicking neuronal processing times, muscular dynamics and\ninertia, saccade-like changes in gaze direction are generated if the target is\ndisplaced rapidly on the pursuing fly's retina.

Simultaneous recordings of movement and sound indicate\nthat the entire stridulatory file is used for sound production and there is\nnearly a 1:1 correspondence between the number of cycles in a song and the\nnumber of teeth on the file. There is an overall tendency for both the spacing\nof teeth to increase along the file and the velocity of wing closure to\nincrease as the scraper traverses the file. There is considerable variation,\nhowever, in the evenness of tooth spacing and in the instantaneous velocity of\nwing closure during sound production. The production of sustained pulses\nappears to depend on resonance in the right tegmen, with the left tegmen\nacting primarily as a damping element. This resonance is not strongly coupled\nto the scraper and, unlike crickets, the timing of file-scraper interactions,\nand therefore the phasing of energy input to wing oscillations, is variable.\nSimilarly, the quality of the sound spectrum varies over the course of a\nsingle stridulatory wing-stroke. Based on measurements of tooth spacing on the\nstridulatory file and cycle-by-cycle frequency of sound output, we predicted\nthe velocity of wing movement that would provide consistent phasing of\nfile-scraper interactions with respect to sound-radiating wing oscillations\nand compared this with measurements of wing velocity. Acceleration of wing\nvelocity during stridulation results in a closer match to the velocity\nrequired for optimal phasing during a portion of the call, and this\ncorresponds with higher amplitudes of radiated sound and the excitation of\nhigher order modes of vibration (evident as distinct harmonic peaks in\nspectrograms).

Oblate medusae\nhave been previously observed to generate vortex ring structures during the\npropulsive cycle. Owing to the inherent physical coupling between locomotor\nand feeding structures in these animals, the dynamics of vortex ring formation\nmust be robustly tuned to facilitate effective functioning of both systems. To\nunderstand how this is achieved, we employed dye visualization techniques on\nscyphomedusae (Aurelia aurita) observed swimming in their natural\nmarine habitat. The flow created during each propulsive cycle consists of a\ntoroidal starting vortex formed during the power swimming stroke, followed by\na stopping vortex of opposite rotational sense generated during the recovery\nstroke. These two vortices merge in a laterally oriented vortex superstructure\nthat induces flow both toward the subumbrellar feeding surfaces and\ndownstream. The lateral vortex motif discovered here appears to be critical to\nthe dual function of the medusa bell as a flow source for feeding and\npropulsion. Furthermore, vortices in the animal wake have a greater volume and\ncloser spacing than predicted by prevailing models of medusan swimming. These\neffects are shown to be advantageous for feeding and swimming performance, and\nare an important consequence of vortex interactions that have been previously\nneglected."},{"title":"Statistical analysis of modified complete randomized designs: applications to chemo-orientation studies","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/7/1267","abstract":"Often experimental scientists employ a Randomized Complete Block Design\n(RCBD) to study the effect of treatments on different subjects. Under a\n`complete randomization', the order of the apparatus setups within each block,\nincluding all replications of each treatment across all subjects, is\ncompletely randomized. However, in many experimental settings complete\nrandomization is impractical due to the cost involved in re-adjusting the\ndevice to administer a new treatment. One typically resorts to a type of\n`restricted randomization', in which multiple subjects are tested under each\ntreatment before the apparatus is re-adjusted. The order of the treatments as\nwell as the assignment of subjects to each block are random. If the data\nobtained under any type of restricted randomization are treated as if the data\nwere collected under an RCBD with complete randomization within each block,\nthen there is potential to increase the risk of false positives (Type I\nerror). This is of concern to animal orientation studies and other areas such\nas chemical ecology where it is impractical to reset the experimental device\nfor each subject tested. The goal of the research presented in this article is\ntwofold: (1) to demonstrate the consequences of constructing an\nF-statistic based on a mean square error for testing the significance\nof treatment effects under the restricted randomization; (2) to describe an\nalternative method, based on split-plot analysis of variance, to analyze\ndesigned experiments that yield better power under the restricted\nrandomization.

Recent work, however, has shown that eggs of a moth, Manduca\nsexta, are oxygen limited at high but realistic temperatures\n(32–37°C) and that PO2 drops steeply\nacross the eggshell. Here we use theoretical and experimental approaches to\npartition the total resistance to oxygen flux among several steps in the\noxygen cascade from environment to embryo. Standard mass-transfer analysis\nsuggests that boundary layers of air around eggs, and around substrates to\nwhich they are attached, offer negligible resistance. Likewise, a mathematical\nmodel, parameterized using published and newly obtained morphological data,\npredicts that air-filled parts of the chorion also do not resist oxygen flux.\nThis prediction was confirmed by experiments that measured rates of carbon\ndioxide emission from batches of eggs subjected simultaneously to hypoxia and\ninert gas substitution: depression of metabolic rate by hypoxia was not\nrescued when the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in air was doubled by\nsubstituting helium for nitrogen. The model did predict, however, that a set\nof subchoral layers (a crystalline chorionic layer, a wax layer and the\nvitelline membrane) could account for most or all of the total resistance to\noxygen flux. Support for this prediction was obtained from two sequential\nexperiments. First, eggs extracted with chloroform:methanol had highly\nelevated rates of water loss, suggesting that indeed eggs of M. sexta\nare waterproofed by wax. Second, rates of water loss and carbon dioxide\nemission from batches of eggs, measured from laying to hatching, changed in\nparallel over development. These data suggest that a single layer, likely a\nwax layer or a combination of wax and other subchoral layers, provides the\nmain resistance to water efflux and oxygen influx."},{"title":"Testing the hindlimb-strength hypothesis: non-aerial locomotion by Chiroptera is not constrained by the dimensions of the femur or tibia","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/7/1309","abstract":"In the evolution of flight bats appear to have suffered a trade-off; they\nhave become poor crawlers relative to terrestrial mammals. Capable walking\ndoes occur in a few disparate taxa, including the vampire bats, but the vast\nmajority of bats are able only to shuffle awkwardly along the ground, and the\nmorphological bases of differences in crawling ability are not currently\nunderstood. One widely cited hypothesis suggests that the femora of most bats\nare too weak to withstand the compressive forces that occur during terrestrial\nlocomotion, and that the vampire bats can walk because they possess more\nrobust hindlimb skeletons. We tested a prediction of the hindlimb-strength\nhypothesis: that during locomotion, the forces produced by the hindlimbs of\nvampire bats should be larger than those produced by the legs of poorly\ncrawling bats. Using force plates we compared the hindlimb forces produced by\ntwo species of vampire bats that walk well, Desmodus rotundus\n(N=8) and Diaemus youngi (N=2), to the hindlimb\nforces produced during over-ground shuffling by a similarly sized bat that is\na poor walker (Pteronotus parnellii; N=6).

We have identified a network of neurons that appears to constitute\nthe central pattern generator (CPG) for this locomotor behavior, one of only a\nfew such networks to be described in cellular detail. The network consists of\ntwo pairs of interneurons, termed `swim interneuron 1' (sint1) and\n`swim interneuron 2' (sint2), arranged around a plane of bilateral\nsymmetry. Interneurons on one side of the brain, which includes the paired\ncerebral, pleural and pedal ganglia, coordinate bending movements toward the\nsame side and communicate via non-rectifying electrical synapses.\nInterneurons on opposite sides of the brain coordinate antagonistic movements\nand communicate over mutually inhibitory synaptic pathways. Several criteria\nwere used to identify members of the swim CPG, the most important being the\nability to shift the phase of swimming behavior in a quantitative fashion by\nbriefly altering the firing pattern of an individual neuron. Strong\ndepolarization of any of the interneurons produces an ipsilateral swimming\nmovement during which the several components of the motor act occur in\nsequence. Strong hyperpolarization causes swimming to stop and leaves the\nanimal contracted to the opposite side for the duration of the\nhyperpolarization. The four swim interneurons make appropriate synaptic\nconnections with motoneurons, exciting synergists and inhibiting antagonists.\nFinally, these are the only neurons that were found to have this set of\nproperties in spite of concerted efforts to sample widely in the\nMelibe CNS. This led us to conclude that these four cells constitute\nthe CPG for swimming. While sint1 and sint2 work together\nduring swimming, they play different roles in the generation of other\nbehaviors. Sint1 is normally silent when the animal is crawling on a\nsurface but it depolarizes and begins to fire in strong bursts once the foot\nis dislodged and the animal begins to swim. Sint2 also fires in\nbursts during swimming, but it is not silent in non-swimming animals. Instead\nactivity in sint2 is correlated with turning movements as the animal\ncrawls on a surface. This suggests that the Melibe motor system is\norganized in a hierarchy and that the alternating movements characteristic of\nswimming emerge when activity in sint1 and sint2 is bound\ntogether."},{"title":"Cardiorespiratory and metabolic reactions during entrance into torpor in\ndormice, Glis glis","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/7/1373","abstract":"Dormice voluntarily enter torpor at ambient temperatures ranging between\n0–28°C.

Qualitatively, squid jets were periodic, steady, and\nprolonged emissions of fluid that exhibited an elongated core of high speed\nflow. The development of a leading vortex ring common to jets emitted from\npipes into still water often appeared to be diminished and delayed. We were\nable to mimic this effect in jets produced by a piston and pipe arrangement\naligned with a uniform background flow. As in continuous jets, squid jets\nshowed evidence of the growth of instability waves in the jet shear layer\nfollowed by the breakup of the jet into packets of vorticity of varying\ndegrees of coherence. These ranged from apparent chains of short-lived vortex\nrings to turbulent plumes. There was some evidence of the complete roll-up of\na handful of shorter jets into single vortex rings, but steady propulsion by\nindividual vortex ring puffs was never observed. Quantitatively, the length of\nthe jet structure in the visualized field of view, Lj, was\nobserved to be 7.2-25.6 cm, and jet plug lengths, L, were estimated\nto be 4.4-49.4 cm using average jet velocity and jet period. These lengths and\nan average jet orifice diameter, D, of 0.8 cm were used to calculate\nthe ratios Lj/D and L/D, which\nranged from 9.0 to 32.0 and 5.5 to 61.8, respectively. Jets emitted from pipes\nin the presence of a background flow suggested that the ratio between the\nbackground flow velocity and the jet velocity was more important than\nL/D to predict jet structure. Average jet velocities in\nsteadily swimming squid ranged from 19.9 to 85.8 cm s-1 (0.90-2.98\nLm s-1) and were always greater in magnitude\nthan swimming speed. Maximum instantaneous fluid speeds within squid jets\nranged from 25.6 to 136.4 cm s-1. Average jet thrust determined\nboth from jet velocity and from three-dimensional approximations of momentum\nchange in successive jet visualizations showed some differences and ranged\nfrom 0.009 to 0.045 N over the range of swimming speeds observed. The fraction\nby which the average jet velocity exceeded the swimming speed, or `slip',\ndecreased with increasing swimming speed, which reveals higher jet propulsive\nefficiency at higher swimming speeds. Jet angle, subtended from the\nhorizontal, decreased from approximately 29° to 7° with increasing\nswimming speed. Jet frequency ranged from 0.6 to 1.3 Hz in the majority of\nswimming sequences, and the data suggest higher frequencies at the lowest and\nhighest speeds.

The map of the antennal lobe of females served then as a\nbasis to identify glomeruli containing dendritic arborisations of 14\nphysiologically characterised projection neurons. Projection neurons\nresponding to the same plant compound did not always arborise in the same\nglomerulus and some neurons arborising in the same glomerulus responded to\ndifferent compounds. Different zones of target glomeruli were, however,\nidentified when pooling all neurons responding to one of two different\ncompounds respectively (α-farnesene and nonatriene). All identified\nglomeruli of specifically responding projection neurons were situated close to\nthe anterior surface of the antennal lobe. One broadly responding projection\nneuron arborised in a more posteriorly situated glomerulus. A local\ninterneuron responding to only one compound was arborising densely in a\nneighbouring glomerulus and had sparse branches in all other glomeruli. These\nresults are discussed with respect to plant odour processing and\nstructure-function relations in antennal lobe neurons. The 3D AL atlas will,\nin the future, also be used to obtain a better understanding of coding\nmechanisms of grapevine odours in this pest insect."},{"title":"Honeybee flight metabolic rate: does it depend upon air temperature?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/6/1161","abstract":"Differing conclusions have been reached as to how or whether varying heat\nproduction has a thermoregulatory function in flying honeybees Apis\nmellifera.

For periods\nof voluntary, uninterrupted, self-sustaining flight, metabolic rate was\nindependent of air temperature between 19 and 37°C. Thorax temperatures\n(Tth) were very stable, with a slope of thorax temperature\non air temperature of 0.18. Evaporative heat loss increased from 51 mW\ng-1 at 25°C to 158 mW g-1 at 37°C and appeared\nto account for head and abdomen temperature excess falling sharply over the\nsame air temperature range. As air temperature increased from 19 to 37°C,\nwingbeat frequency showed a slight but significant increase, and metabolic\nexpenditure per wingbeat showed a corresponding slight but significant\ndecrease. Bees spent an average of 52% of the measurement period in flight,\nwith 19 of 78 bees sustaining uninterrupted voluntary flight for periods of>\n1 min. The fraction of time spent flying declined as air temperature\nincreased. As the fraction of time spent flying decreased, the slope of\nmetabolic rate on air temperature became more steeply negative, and was\nsignificant for bees flying less than 80% of the time. In a separate\nexperiment, there was a significant inverse relationship of metabolic rate and\nair temperature for bees requiring frequent or constant agitation to remain\nairborne, but no dependence for bees that flew with little or no agitation;\nbees were less likely to require agitation during outdoor than indoor\nmeasurements.

Muscle strain in\nrelation to length change of the muscle-tendon unit","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/6/1175","abstract":"The activity of muscles can be concentric (shortening), eccentric\n(lengthening) or isometric (constant length). When studying muscle function it\nis important to know what the muscle fascicles are actually doing because the\nperformance of muscle is strongly influenced by the type of activity: force\ndecreases as a function of shortening velocity during concentric contractions;\nforce produced during eccentric contractions can be stronger than maximum\nisometric force, and force production is enhanced if a concentric contraction\nfollows an eccentric phase. It is well known that length changes of muscle\nfascicles may be different from length changes of the overall muscle-tendon\nunit because of the compliance of the series elasticity. Consequently,\nfascicles of joint extensor muscles may not undergo eccentric activity even\nwhen the joint flexes, but the extent to which this occurs may vary with the\ncompliance of the series elasticity and may differ between species: the vastus\nlateralis, a knee extensor, shortens when active during trotting in dogs and\nlengthens in rats. Previous studies of kinematics of trotting in horses have\nshown that during stance, the elbow extends nearly continuously with a brief\nperiod of flexion near mid-stance and the knee exhibits two phases of flexion\nfollowed by extension. The lateral triceps (an elbow extensor) has no external\ntendon but the vastus lateralis has a relatively long external tendon and the\nfascicles insert on an aponeurosis. Thus, one might expect the relation\nbetween fascicle strain and overall length change of the muscle-tendon units\nto be quite different in these two muscles. In the present study in horses,\nfascicle length changes of the lateral triceps and vastus lateralis were\nmeasured with sonomicrometry and length changes of the muscle-tendon units\nwere estimated from muscle architecture and joint kinematics for four horses\ntrotting on a treadmill at nine speeds. Because the focus of this study was\nthe relation between length changes of the muscle-tendon unit (estimated from\nkinematics) and length changes in the muscle fascicles, we divided the\nstance-phase sonomicrometry records into phases that corresponded to the\nalternating flexion and extension of the joint as indicated by the kinematic\nrecords. During its one eccentric phase, the triceps shortened by\n0.7±0.4% despite a predicted lengthening of 1%. Similarly, the vastus\nshortened by 3.7±1.9% when kinematics predicted 3.2% lengthening.\nDuring their concentric phases the triceps shortened by 10.6% and the vastus\nshortened by 8.1%. Strain in the triceps did not change with speed but it did\nin the vastus. Strain rate increased with speed in both muscles as did the\nintegrated EMG, indicating an increase in the volume of muscle recruited.\nThus, despite differences in their architecture and the kinematic patterns of\nthe associated joints, these two joint extensors exhibited similar\nactivity."},{"title":"In vivo muscle function vs speed II.

During level\ntrotting in the horse, the triceps had shortening strains of around 10.6%\nwhile the vastus shortened 8.1% during the stance phase. Because of the 250%\nincrease in metabolic rate in horses trotting up a 10% incline which is,\npresumably, a result of the increased requirement for mechanical work, we\nhypothesized that muscle strain during trotting would be increased in both the\ntriceps and the vastus over that observed when trotting on the level. Because\ntimes of contact are similar in level and incline trotting, we also\nhypothesized that strain rates of these muscles would be increased,\naccompanied by an increase in EMG activity.

The triceps shortened by 18% compared with\n10.6% shortening on the level, and the vastus shortened by 18.5% compared with\n8.1% on the level. The increased shortening velocities that were observed in\nboth muscles probably reduced the force that any given set of activated muscle\nfibers could produce. If this pattern held for other limb muscles that do work\nto elevate the horse's center of mass on an incline, then a greater volume of\nmuscle would have to be recruited to generate an equivalent force for body\nsupport.

Laser vibrometric studies of tympanic motion show pronounced\ndirectionality within a 1.8-2.4 kHz frequency band around the best frequency\nof hearing, caused by the interference of ipsi- and contralateral inputs.

The most\nlikely candidate for the objective function is metabolic cost per distance\ntraveled, where the hypothesis predicts that the subject will minimize the\ncost of travel under a given gait constraint even if this requires an unusual\nstep length and frequency combination. In the current study this is tested\ndirectly by measuring the walking behavior of subjects constrained\nsystematically to determined speeds, step frequencies or step lengths and\ncomparing behavior to predictions derived directly from minimization of\nmeasured metabolic cost. A metabolic cost surface in speed-frequency space is\nderived from metabolic rate for 10 subjects walking at 49 speed-frequency\nconditions. Optimization is predicted from the iso-energetic cost contours\nderived from this surface. Substantial congruence is found between the\npredicted and observed behavior using the cost of walking per unit distance.\nAlthough minimization of cost per distance appears to dominate walking\ncontrol, certain notable differences from predicted behavior suggest that\nother factors must also be considered.

Our DPIV analyses\nand smoke visualisations match the results of previous flow visualisation\nexperiments at midwing, and we extend the experiments to provide the first\nanalysis of the flow field above the thorax. Detailed DPIV measurements show\nthat towards the end of the downstroke, the LEV structure is consistent with\nthat recently reported in free-flying butterflies and dragonflies: the LEV is\ncontinuous across the thorax and runs along each wing to the wingtip, where it\ninflects to form the wingtip trailing vortices. The LEV core is 2-3 mm in\ndiameter (approximately 10% of local wing chord) both at the midwing position\nand over the centreline at 1.2 m s-1 and at 3.5 m s-1\nflight speeds. At 1.2 m s-1 the measured LEV circulation is\n0.012±0.001 m2 s-1 (mean ±\ns.d.) at the centreline and 0.011±0.001\nm2 s-1 halfway along the wing.

The mesic flighted species used a closed, flutter, open, cycle (CFO)\nwhile those species from more arid habitats used a closed, ventilation, cycle\n(CV) or a closed, burst cycle (CB). The relative importance of the\nmesothoracic spiracles in CO2 emission varied between the species,\neven between those from the same genus and habitat. C. bacchus and\nP. femoralis represent extremes of CO2 emission from the\nmesothoracic spiracles; from almost total to almost none, respectively.\nOverall, mesothoracic CO2 emission and convection were more\npronounced in the dry habitat species, supporting the hypothesis that both\nstrategies aid in the reduction of water loss."},{"title":"Human hopping on very soft elastic surfaces: implications for muscle pre-stretch and elastic energy storage in locomotion","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/5/939","abstract":"During hopping in place and running, humans maintain similar center of mass\ndynamics by precisely adjusting leg mechanics to compensate for moderate\nchanges in surface stiffness. We investigated the limits of this precise\ncontrol by asking humans to hop in place on extremely soft elastic surfaces.\nWe found that hoppers drastically altered leg mechanics and maintained similar\ncenter of mass dynamics despite a sevenfold change in surface stiffness\n(11–81 kN m-1). On the stiffest surfaces, the legs compressed\nin early stance and then extended in late stance in the pattern that is\ntypical for normal bouncing gaits. On the softest surfaces, however, subjects\nreversed this pattern so that the legs extended up to 8 cm in early stance and\nthen compressed by a similar distance in late stance. Consequently, the center\nof mass moved downward during stance by 5–7 cm less than the surface\ncompressed and by a similar distance as on the stiffest surfaces. This unique\nleg action probably reduced extensor muscle pre-stretch because the joints\nfirst extended and then flexed during stance. This interpretation is supported\nby the observation that hoppers increased muscle activation by 50% on the\nsoftest surface despite similar joint moments and mechanical leg work as on\nthe stiffest surface. Thus, the extreme adjustment to leg mechanics for very\nsoft surfaces helps maintain normal center of mass dynamics but requires high\nmuscle activation levels due to the loss of the normal extensor muscle\nstretch–shorten cycle."},{"title":"Physiological characterisation of a pH- and calcium-dependent sodium\nuptake mechanism in the freshwater crustacean, Daphnia magna","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/5/951","abstract":"Daphnia are highly sensitive to sodium metabolism disruption\ncaused by aquatic acidification and ionoregulatory toxicants, due to their\nfinely balanced ion homeostasis. Nine different water chemistries of varying\npH (4, 6 and 8) and calcium concentration (0, 0.5 and 1 mmol\nl–1) were used to delineate the mechanism of sodium influx in\nDaphnia magna. Lowering water pH severely inhibited sodium influx\nwhen calcium concentration was high, but transport kinetic analysis revealed a\nstimulated sodium influx capacity (Jmax) when calcium was\nabsent. At low pH increasing water calcium levels decreased\nJmax and raised Km (decreased sodium\ninflux affinity), while at high pH the opposite pattern was observed (elevated\nJmax and reduced Km). These effects on\nsodium influx were mirrored by changes in whole body sodium levels.

When exposed to two identical patterns of different\nintensity, crickets significantly steered towards the louder sound pattern,\nwhenever the intensity difference was greater than 1 dB. Bilateral latency\ndifferences in sound presentation did not always cause clear orientation\ntowards the leading side.

When every other sound pulse was presented from opposite\ndirections, the crickets followed the temporal pattern of sound presentation\nand rapidly steered towards the left and right side. Steering towards\nindividual sound pulses does not agree with the proposal that crickets analyse\nthe quality of sound patterns and then steer towards the better pattern.\nRather, these experiments suggest that fast steering to single sound pulses\ndetermines the lateral deviation of the animals and that complex auditory\norientation emerges from this simple mechanism of auditory steering."},{"title":"Fast-start muscle dynamics in the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus\nmykiss: phase relationship of white muscle shortening and body\ncurvature","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/5/929","abstract":"Muscle length changes of the lateral myotomal fast fibers of rainbow trout\n(Oncorhynchus mykiss) were measured using sonomicrometry during\ninduced fast-starts.

Comparison of these data was used to examine\nthe phase relationship between local muscle shortening and local body bending\nduring unsteady, large amplitude maneuvers. Our analysis finds that muscle\nshortening is temporally decoupled from body bending, probably due to the\ninfluence of hydrodynamic forces. The phase shift was such that midline\ncurvature lagged behind muscle shortening at both the anterior (0.4L,\nwhere L is fork length) and posterior (0.7L) axial\npositions. Stronger escape responses were correlated with high peak strains\nand rapid strain-wave velocities, but not faster curvature-wave velocities.\nUnder these conditions of high strain, the phase shift at the posterior\nposition is significantly increased, whereas the anterior position fails to be\naffected. Curvature lag was still observed at both axial locations under\nconditions of low strain, suggesting that hydrodynamic forces are still\nsignificant during weaker escape responses.

The amplitude of the\nnovelty responses evoked by similar changes in the total energy of electric\nimages was constant despite the large change in basal stimulus amplitude and\nwaveform caused by hovering in the tubes.

The\nobjective of this study was to examine the hypothesis that plantar flexor\nmuscle force production is greatly impaired at the preferred transition speed\n(PTS) due to intrinsic muscle properties and, thus, serves as a determinant\nfor the walk-to-run transition. The plantar flexors have been shown to be\nimportant contributors to satisfying the mechanical energetic demands of\nwalking and are the primary contributors to the observed ground reaction\nforces (GRFs) during the propulsion phase. Thus, if the plantar flexor force\nproduction begins to diminish near the PTS despite an increase in muscle\nactivation, then a corresponding decrease in the GRFs during the propulsion\nphase would be expected. This expectation was supported. Both the peak\nanterior/posterior and vertical GRFs decreased during the propulsion phase at\nwalking speeds near the PTS. A similar decrease was not observed during the\nbraking phase. Further analysis using forward dynamics simulations of walking\nat increasing speeds and running at the PTS revealed that all lower extremity\nmuscle forces increased with walking speed, except the ankle plantar flexors.\nDespite an increase in muscle activation with walking speed, the gastrocnemius\nmuscle force decreased with increasing speed, and the soleus force decreased\nfor walking speeds exceeding 80% PTS. These decreases in force production were\nattributed to the intrinsic force–length–velocity properties of\nmuscle. In addition, the running simulation analysis revealed that the plantar\nflexor forces nearly doubled for similar activation levels when the gait\nswitched to a run at the PTS due to improved contractile conditions. These\nresults suggest the plantar flexors may serve as an important determinant for\nthe walk-to-run transition and highlight the important role intrinsic muscle\nproperties play in determining the specific neuromotor strategies used in\nhuman locomotion."},{"title":"UV incites diverse levels of DNA breaks in different cellular compartments of a branching coral species","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/5/843","abstract":"This study evaluates in vitro the effects of UVB irradiation on\nthree cellular compartments of a shallow water coral species.

Different levels of blood metabolites\nreflected differences in diet consumption, and the relationships between\nprotein nitrogen and trehalose were very similar to those for protein and\ncarbohydrate intake by parasitized and normal larvae on various diets. Dietary\nnutrient ratio had a significant effect on parasite burden, the numbers of\nparasites developing in individual host larvae and on parasite biomass.\nParasites included individuals that developed and eventually emerged as second\ninstar larvae, moulted to third instars and pupated.

Six fat-free chemically defined diets were tested, each having the\nsame total level of casein and sucrose, but with casein to sucrose ratios\nvarying from low protein/high carbohydrate to equal levels of both nutrients\nthrough to high protein/no carbohydrate. Nutrient ratio and parasitism each\naffected nutrient consumption and growth. Feeding responses differed between\nnormal and parasitized larvae, as illustrated by nutrient arrays,\ntwo-dimensional plots of protein and carbohydrate consumption on diets having\ndifferent nutrient ratios. Normal larvae consumed more nutrients and took\nlonger to develop as dietary nutrient ratio was displaced from equal levels of\nboth nutrients.

The deduced sponge arginine kinase sequence displays\nthe two characteristic domains of the ATP:guanido phosphotransferases; it can\nbe grouped to the `usual' mono-domain 40 kDa guanidino kinases (arginine\nkinases). Phylogenetic studies indicate that the metazoan guanidino kinases\nevolved from this ancestral sponge enzyme; among them are also the `unusual'\ntwo-domain 80 kDa guanidino kinases. The high expression level of the\narginine kinase gene was already measurable 1 day after addition of\nsilicic acid by northern blot, as well as by in situ hybridization\nanalysis. Parallel determinations of enzyme activity confirmed that high\nlevels of arginine kinase are present in primmorphs that had been exposed for\n1-5 days to silicic acid.

In the present study we used a\nmultidisciplinary approach to examine the possibility that the mole-rat\nestimates the location and physical properties of underground obstacles using\nreflected self-generated seismic waves (seismic `echolocation').Our field observations revealed that all the monitored mole-rats produced\nlow-frequency seismic waves (250-300 Hz) at intervals of 8±5 s (range:\n1-13 s) between head drums while digging a bypass to detour an obstacle. Using\na computerized simulation model we demonstrated that it is possible for the\nmole-rat to determine its distance from an obstacle boundary (open ditch or\nstone) by evaluating the amplitude (intensity) of the seismic wave reflected\nback to it from the obstacle interface. By evaluating the polarity of the\nreflected wave the mole-rat could distinguish between air space and solid\nobstacles. Further, the model showed that the diffracted waves from the\nobstacle's corners could give the mole-rat precise information on the obstacle\nsize and its relative spatial position.In a behavioural experiment using a special T-maze setup, we tested whether\nthe mole-rat can perceive seismic waves through the somatosensory system and\nlocalize the source.

In a\nhistological examination of the glabrous skin of the mole-rat's paws we\nidentified lamellate corpuscle mechanoreceptors that might be used to detect\nlow frequency seismic waves.The combined findings from these different approaches lead us to suggest\nthat a specialized seismic `echolocation' system could be used by subterranean\nmammals to determine the most energy-conserving strategy with which to bypass\nan obstacle, as well as to estimate their distance from the surface, keeping\ntheir tunnels at the optimal depth."},{"title":"The early life history of tissue oxygenation in crustaceans: the strategy\nof the myodocopid ostracod Cylindroleberis mariae","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/4/661","abstract":"We studied basic principles of respiratory physiology in\nCylindroleberididae, Cylindroleberis mariae Baird 1850,\nwhich are millimetre-sized crustaceans (myodocop ostracod) having a fossil\nrecord dating back to about 425 millions years ago.

These hair receptors act as predator sensors. The\nobserved levels of hair morphological variation were then incorporated into a\nbiomechanical model of the hair canopy response to air flow to predict their\ninfluence on cricket predator perception. Cricket populations differ from each\nother, often strongly so, in the total number of hairs and in the number of\nhairs longer than 1 mm, which are the hairs most sensitive for the perception\nof approaching predators. The hair canopy response, the output of the\nbiomechanical model, sums up over the entire canopy the angles of deflection\nat which a neurophysiological response is triggered and represents the\nsensitivity of the cercal system. It is 35% higher in the most sensitive\npopulation, compared with the least sensitive population. These large\ndifferences in perception sensitivity for a given predator signal translate\ninto larger distances at which predators could be perceived.

The unstable oscillatory mode consists of pitching and\nhorizontal moving oscillations with negligible vertical motion. The period of\nthe oscillations is 0.32 s (approx. 50 times the wingbeat period of the\nbumblebee). The oscillations double in amplitude in 0.1 s; coupling of nose-up\npitching with forward horizontal motion (and nose-down pitching with backward\nhorizontal motion) in this mode causes the instability. The stable fast\nsubsidence mode consists of monotonic pitching and horizontal motions, which\ndecay to half of the starting values in 0.024 s. The stable slow subsidence\nmode is mainly a monotonic descending (or ascending) motion, which decays to\nhalf of its starting value in 0.37 s.Due to the unstable oscillatory mode, the hovering flight of the bumblebee\nis dynamically unstable. However, the instability might not be a great problem\nto a bumblebee that tries to stay hovering: the time for the initial\ndisturbances to double (0.1 s) is more than 15 times the wingbeat period (6.4\nms), and the bumblebee has plenty of time to adjust its wing motion before the\ndisturbances grow large."},{"title":"Factors reducing the expected deflection in initial orientation in clock-shifted homing pigeons","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/3/469","abstract":"To orient from familiar sites, homing pigeons can rely on both an olfactory\nmap and visual familiar landmarks.

Hemoglobin\noxygen saturation was measured in vivo by combining video imaging\ntechniques with a spectrophotometrical analysis of hemoglobin light absorption\nat specific wavelengths for maximal absorption of oxygenated and deoxygenated\nblood (413 nm and 431 nm, respectively) under normoxic conditions and after a\n10 min period of hyperoxia (PO2=100 kPa),\nassuming that at a PO2 of 100 kPa the\nhemoglobin is fully saturated. The results demonstrated that red blood cell\noxygenation of zebrafish larvae at 4 days post fertilization (d.p.f.), 5\nd.p.f. and 12 d.p.f. could be increased by hyperoxia. The data suggest that at\nthe time of yolk sac degradation (i.e. 4 d.p.f. and 5 d.p.f.), when the total\nsurface area of the animal is reduced, bulk diffusion of oxygen may not be\nsufficient to prevent a partial deoxygenation of the hemoglobin. The decrease\nin hemoglobin oxygenation observed at 12 d.p.f. confirms earlier studies\nindicating that at 12–14 d.p.f., convective oxygen transport becomes\nnecessary to ensure oxygen supply to the growing tissues."},{"title":"An allometric comparison of microsomal membrane lipid composition and sodium pump molecular activity in the brain of mammals and birds","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/2/371","abstract":"Previous research has shown that the lipid milieu surrounding membrane\nproteins may be an important factor in determining their activity.

The relative expression of the two isoforms of TnT was\nthen examined at seven longitudinal positions from each of three fish using\nSDS-PAGE and densitometry on the silver-stained TnT bands. A significant shift\nin expression was detected from anterior to posterior in all three fish with\nTnT S1 becoming more dominant in the posterior red muscle. As predicted, a\nshift in TnT expression was associated with the decrease in activation rate\nalong the length of the fish. This study was then extended to include a\ndifferent species of salmonid, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, to\nexplore the generality of TnT modulation of muscle activation. Muscle\ncontractile properties were determined from anterior and posterior muscle, and\nrelative expression of S1 and S2 was determined. Unlike rainbow trout, there\nis no consistent longitudinal pattern of muscle activation in brook trout:\nsome fish have kinetically faster muscle in the anterior, some in the\nposterior.

In effect, the\nspatial decomposition of incident sound into discrete frequency components\ninvolves a tympanal travelling wave that funnels mechanical energy to specific\ntympanal locations, where distinct groups of mechanoreceptor neurones project.\nNotably, observed tympanal deflections differ from those predicted by drum\ntheory. Although phenomenologically equivalent, von Békésy's and\nthe locust's waves differ in their physical implementation. von\nBékésy's wave is born from interactions between the anisotropic\nbasilar membrane and the surrounding incompressible fluids, whereas the\nlocust's wave rides on an anisotropic membrane suspended in air. The locust's\near thus combines in one structure the functions of sound reception and\nfrequency decomposition."},{"title":"Extramuscular myofascial force transmission for in situ rat\nmedial gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles in progressive stages of\ndissection","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/1/129","abstract":"The aim of this study was to establish the extent of extramuscular\nmyofascial force transmission for dissected rat medial gastrocnemius (GM) and\nplantaris (PL) muscles.

In the stage where GM was still connected to\nextramuscular tissues, the experiments showed that up to 40.5±5.9%\n(mean ± s.e.m.) of the force exerted\nby the neighbouring PL muscle was transmitted onto the calcaneal bone, even\nwhen the PL tendon was not connected to this bone. After distal PL-tenotomy, a\ndifference between proximally and distally measured forces of GM constituted\nevidence for myofascial force transmission.

This plasticity is expressed when\npresynaptic activation is associated with a characteristically broad,\npostsynaptic action potential, lasting 7-15 ms, occurring within a window of\nup to 60-80 ms following synaptic activation. Since the site of plastic change\nis presumably in the apical dendrites, it is important to know where, when and\nhow this broad spike is generated and the manner in which such events\npropagate within the intrinsic network of the electrosensory lobe.The electrosensory lobe has a strict layered organization that makes the\npreparation suitable for one dimension current source density analysis. Using\nthis technique in an `in vitro' interface slice preparation, we found\nthat following either parallel fiber stimulation or an orthogonal field\nstimulus, a sink appeared in the ganglionic layer and propagated into the\nmolecular layer. Intracellular records from MG somata showed these stimuli\nevoked broad action potentials whose timing corresponds to this sink. TTX\napplication in the deep fiber layer blocked the synaptically evoked ganglionic\nlayer field potential and the `N3' wave of the outer molecular\nlayer field potential simultaneously, while the molecular layer\n`N1' and `N2' waves corresponding to synaptic activation\nof the apical dendrites remained intact. These results confirm the hypothesis\nthat the broad spikes of MG cells originate in the soma and propagate through\nthe molecular layer in the apical dendritic tree, and suggest the possibility\nthat this backpropagation may contribute to `boosting' of the synaptic\nresponse in distal apical dendrites in certain circumstances."},{"title":"Does feeding limit cardiovascular modulation in the Dungeness crab\nCancer magister during hypoxia?","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/1/83","abstract":"Decapod crustaceans inhabit aquatic environments that are frequently\nsubjected to changes in oxygen content.

However, all\nthese experiments were conducted on animals that were starved prior to\nexperimentation in order to avoid increases in metabolism associated with\ndigestive processes. The present study sought to determine how the Dungeness\ncrab Cancer magister balances the demands of physiological systems\nwhen they feed and digest in hypoxia. Cardiac parameters and haemolymph flow\nrates through each arterial system exiting the heart were measured using a\npulsed-Doppler flowmeter. Scaphognathite beat frequency (ventilation rate) was\ncalculated by recording changes in pressure in the branchial chamber. There\nwas an increase in both cardiac and ventilatory parameters following feeding.\nDigestive processes were facilitated by an increase in haemolymph flow rates\nthrough the anterior aorta, hepatic arteries and sternal artery. Cancer\nmagister showed a typical bradycardia during hypoxia (3.2 kPa). However,\nfood intake caused a significant reduction in this response. Likewise,\nventilation rate also showed effects of addivity, increasing in response to\nboth food intake and hypoxia. Digestion during hypoxia was associated with a\ndecrease in both stroke volume and cardiac output. Blood was diverted away\nfrom digestive structures, suggesting that blood flow events are prioritized\nduring hypoxia. The changes in haemolymph flow rates paralleled those in\nprevious reports on reductions in protein synthesis in the hepatopancreas\nduring hypoxia. Haemolymph flow rates through the anterior aorta did not\nchange; thus the blood supply to the supraoesophageal ganglion was maintained\nduring feeding in hypoxia.

Measurements were obtained over a range of\naccelerations ranging from -6 m s-2 to 8 m s-2. The goal\nof our study was to determine which joints are used to modulate mechanical\npower when tammar wallabies change speed. From these measurements, we also\nsought to determine which hind limb muscle groups are the most important for\nproducing changes in mechanical work. Because our previous in vivo\nanalyses of wallaby distal muscle function indicated that these muscle-tendon\nunits favor elastic energy savings and perform little work during steady level\nand incline hopping, we hypothesized that proximal muscle groups operating at\nthe hip and knee joint are most important for the modulation of mechanical\nwork and power. Of the four hind limb joints examined, the ankle joint had the\ngreatest influence on the total limb work, accounting for 89% of the variation\nobserved with changing speed. The hip and metatarsophalageal (MP) joints also\ncontributed to modulating whole limb work, but to a lesser degree than the\nankle, accounting for 28% (energy production) and -24% (energy absorption) of\nthe change in whole limb work versus acceleration, respectively. In\ncontrast, the work produced at the knee joint was independent of acceleration.\nBased on the results of our previous in vivo studies and given that\nthe magnitude of power produced at the ankle exceeds that which these muscles\nalone could produce, we conclude that the majority of power produced at the\nankle joint is likely transferred from the hip and knee joints via\nproximal bi-articular muscles, operating in tandem with bi-articular ankle\nextensors, to power changes in hopping speed of tammar wallabies.\nAdditionally, over the observed range of performance, peak joint moments at\nthe ankle (and resulting tendon strains) did not increase significantly with\nacceleration, indicating that having thin tendons favoring elastic energy\nstorage does not necessarily limit a tammar wallaby's ability to accelerate or\ndecelerate."},{"title":"Low-frequency fatigue, post-tetanic potentiation and their interaction at different muscle lengths following eccentric exercise","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/208/1/55","abstract":"Low-frequency fatigue (LFF) and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) were\nquantified at different muscle lengths in rat medial gastrocnemius (GM)\nmuscle.
