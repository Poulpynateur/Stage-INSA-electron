        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/9/jeb194365",
        "abstract": "Acute warming in fish increases heart rate (fH) and cardiac output to peak values, after which performance plateaus or declines and arrhythmia may occur. This cardiac response can place a convective limitation on systemic oxygen delivery at high temperatures. To test the hypothesis that autonomic cardiac regulation protects cardiac performance in rainbow trout during acute warming, we investigated adrenergic and cholinergic regulation during the onset and progression of cardiac limitations. We explored the direct effects of adrenergic stimulation by acutely warming an in situ working perfused heart until arrhythmia occurred, cooling the heart to restore rhythmicity and rewarming with increasing adrenergic stimulation. Adrenergic stimulation produced a clear, dose-dependent increase in the temperature and peak fH achieved prior to the onset of arrhythmia. To examine how this adrenergic protection functions in conjunction with cholinergic vagal inhibition in vivo, rainbow trout fitted with ECG electrodes were acutely warmed in a respirometer until they lost equilibrium (CTmax) with and without muscarinic (atropine) and β-adrenergic (sotalol) antagonists. Trout exhibited roughly equal and opposing cholinergic and adrenergic tone on fH that persisted up to critical temperatures. β-Adrenergic blockade significantly lowered peak fH by 14–17%, while muscarinic blockade significantly lowered the temperature for peak fH by 2.0°C. Moreover, muscarinic and β-adrenergic blockers injected individually or together significantly reduced CTmax by up to 3°C, indicating for the first time that cardiac adrenergic stimulation and cholinergic inhibition can enhance acute heat tolerance in rainbow trout at the level of the heart and the whole animal."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/early/2019/04/30/jeb.199265",
        "abstract": "Variation in the concentration of antioxidants and hormones of maternal origin in the eggs of birds can have profound influences on offspring phenotype both pre- and post-natally. Egg maternal substances, however, can have interacting effects, but experimental studies of the consequences of the combined variation in the egg concentration of such molecules are extremely rare, particularly as far as prenatal stages are considered. We manipulated the yolk concentrations of vitamin E and corticosterone, which are the main antioxidants and, respectively, the main glucocorticoid hormone in bird eggs, both independently and simultaneously and we tested their separate and combined effects on growth and oxidative status in the liver and in the brain of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) embryos. Egg supplementation of relatively large, yet physiological doses of corticosterone depressed embryo growth (total body mass, tarsus length and liver mass) while administration of vitamin E in association with corticosterone restored normal growth. Vitamin E did not affect embryo growth when administered alone. We further analyzed independent and combined effects of vitamin E and corticosterone on liver and brain total antioxidant capacity, concentration of reactive oxygen molecules and lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E significantly reduced liver total antioxidant capacity, while corticosterone depressed brain lipid peroxidation. Prenatal exposure to vitamin E and corticosterone appears to have antagonistic effects on body growth, although vitamin E is not limiting in yellow-legged gull eggs. In combination with the results of previous experiments on the same species applying smaller experimental doses or focusing on the post-natal rather than pre-natal life stages, our findings indicate that the effects of a physiological increase in the egg concentrations of these substances can be life stage- and dose-specific, implying that generalizing prenatal effects of egg compounds may not be feasible."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/9/jeb195628",
        "abstract": "Many parasitic wasps use slender and steerable ovipositors to lay eggs in hosts hidden in substrates, but it is currently unknown how steering is achieved. The ovipositors generally consist of three longitudinally connected elements, one dorsal and two ventral valves that can slide along each other. For the parasitic wasp Diachasmimorpha longicaudata, it has been shown that protraction of the ventral valves causes incurving of the ventral valves towards the dorsal one, which results in a change in probing direction. We hypothesize that this shape change is due to differences in bending stiffness along the ovipositor. Alignment of the stiff tip of the dorsal valve with a more flexible ventral S-shaped region situated just behind the tip straightens this S-bend and results in upwards rotation of the ventral tip. We show that the S-shaped region of the ventral valves has a low bending stiffness because it contains soft materials such as resilin. In contrast, the large cross-sectional area of the dorsal valve tip area probably results in a high bending stiffness. Elsewhere, the dorsal valve is less stiff than the ventral valves. Our results support the hypothesis that the interaction between the stiff dorsal valve portion and the more flexible S-shaped region co-determines the configurational tip changes required for steering the ovipositor in any desired direction along curved paths in the substrate. This provides novel insights in the understanding of steering mechanisms of the hymenopteran ovipositor, and for application in man-made probes."

        "abstract": "This study examined the expression and role of vitellogenin (Vg) in the body of the firebug Pyrrhocoris apterus (Heteroptera, Insecta) during the infection elicited by two entomopathogenic organisms, the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae and the fungus Isaria fumosorosea. Infection by S. carpocapsae significantly up-regulated Vg mRNA expression in the male body. The corresponding increase in Vg protein expression was also confirmed by electrophoretic and immunoblotting analyses. Remarkably, in females, the tendency was opposite. Nematodal infection significantly reduced both Vg mRNA and Vg protein expression levels in fat body and hemolymph, respectively. We speculate that infection of reproductive females reduces Vg expression to the level, which is still sufficient for defense, but insufficient for reproduction. This circumstance reduces energy expenditure and helps the individual to cope with the infection. Importantly, purified Vg significantly inhibited growth of Xenorhabdus spp., an entomotoxic bacteria isolated from S. carpocapsae. However, the effect of Vg against I. fumosorosea was not so obvious. The fungus significantly stimulated Vg gene expression in males, however, a similar increase was not recapitulated on the protein level. Nevertheless, in females, both mRNA and protein Vg levels were significantly reduced after the fungal infection. The obtained data demonstrate that Vg is likely an important defense protein, possibly with a specific activity. This considerably expands the known spectrum of Vg functions, as its primary role was thought to be limited to regulating egg development in the female body."

        "abstract": "The small size of Malpighian tubules in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has discouraged measurements of the transepithelial electrical resistance. The present study introduces two methods for measuring the transepithelial resistance in isolated Drosophila Malpighian tubules using conventional microelectrodes and PClamp hardware and software. The first method uses three microelectrodes to measure the specific transepithelial resistance normalized to tubule length or luminal surface area for comparison with resistances of other epithelia. The second method uses only two microelectrodes to measure the relative resistance for comparing before and after effects in a single Malpighian tubule. Knowledge of the specific transepithelial resistance allows the first electrical model of electrolyte secretion by the main segment of the anterior Malpighian tubule of Drosophila. The electrical model is remarkably similar to that of the distal Malpighian tubule of Aedes aegypti when tubules of Drosophila and Aedes are studied in vitro under the same experimental conditions. Thus, despite 189 millions of years of evolution separating these two genera, the electrophysiological properties of their Malpighian tubules remains remarkably conserved."

        "abstract": "The ability of a bone to withstand loads depends on its structural and material properties. These tend to differ among species with different modes of locomotion, reflecting their unique loading patterns. The evolution of derived limb morphologies, such as the long limbs associated with jumping, may compromise overall bone strength. We evaluated bone mechanical properties in the Longshanks mouse, which was selectively bred for increased tibia length relative to body mass. We combined analyses of 3D shape and cross-sectional geometry of the tibia, with mechanical testing, and bone composition assays, to compare bone strength, elastic properties, and mineral composition in Longshanks and in random-bred controls. Our data show that, despite being more slender, cortical geometry and predicted bending strength of the Longshanks tibia were similar to controls. In whole bone bending tests, measures of bone bending strength were similar across groups, however, Longshanks tibiae were significantly more rigid, more brittle, and required less than half the energy to fracture. Tissue-level elastic properties were altered in the same way in Longshanks, but the bones did not differ in water content, ash content, or density. These results indicate that while Longshanks bones are as strong as random-bred control tibiae, selection for increased tibia length has altered its elastic properties, possibly through changes in organic bony matrix composition. We conclude that selection for certain limb morphologies, and/or selection for rapid skeletal growth, can lead to tissue-level changes that can increase the risk of skeletal fracture, which in turn may favor the correlated evolution of compensatory mechanisms to mitigate increased fracture risk, such as delayed skeletal maturity."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/9/jeb195172",
        "abstract": "Center of mass (COM) control has been proposed to serve economy- and stability-related locomotor task objectives. However, given the lack of evidence supporting direct sensing and/or regulation of the COM, it remains unclear whether COM mechanics are prioritized in the control scheme of walking. We posit that peripheral musculoskeletal structures, e.g. muscle, are more realistic control targets than the COM, given their abundance of sensorimotor receptors and ability to influence whole-body energetics. As a first test of this hypothesis, we examined whether conservation of stance-phase joint mechanics is prioritized over COM mechanics in a locomotor task where simultaneous conservation of COM and joint mechanics is not feasible: imposed leg-length asymmetry. Positive joint mechanical cost of transport (work per distance traveled; COTJNT) was maintained at values closer to normal walking than COM mechanical cost of transport (COTCOM; P<0.05, N=15). Furthermore, compared with our measures of COM mechanics (COTCOM, COM displacement), joint-level variables (COTJNT, integrated total support moment) also displayed stronger conservation (less change from normal walking) when the participants' self-selected gait was assessed against other possible gait solutions. We conclude that when walking humans are exposed to an asymmetric leg-length perturbation, control of joint mechanics is prioritized over COM mechanics. Our results suggest that mechanical and metabolic effort is likely regulated via control of peripheral structures and not directly at the level of the COM. Joint mechanics may provide a more accurate representation of the underlying locomotor control targets and may prove advantageous in informing predictive models of human walking."

        "abstract": "The energy used to move a given distance (cost of transport; CoT) varies significantly between individuals of the same species. A lower CoT allows animals to allocate more of their energy budget to growth and reproduction. A higher CoT may cause animals to adjust their movement across different environmental gradients to reduce energy allocated to movement. The aim of this project was to determine whether CoT is a repeatable trait within individuals, and to determine its physiological causes and ecological consequences. We found that CoT is a repeatable trait in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We rejected the hypothesis that mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratios) predicted CoT. We also rejected the hypothesis that CoT is modulated by temperature acclimation, exercise training or their interaction, although CoT increased with increasing acute test temperature. There was a weak but significant negative correlation between CoT and dispersal, measured as the number of exploration decisions made by fish, and the distance travelled against the current in an artificial stream. However, CoT was not correlated with the voluntary speed of fish moving against the current. The implication of these results is that CoT reflects a fixed physiological phenotype of an individual, which is not plastic in response to persistent environmental changes. Consequently, individuals may have fundamentally different energy budgets as they move across environments, and may adjust movement patterns as a result of allocation trade-offs. It was surprising that mitochondrial efficiency did not explain differences in CoT, and our working hypothesis is that the energetics of muscle contraction and relaxation may determine CoT. The increase in CoT with increasing acute environmental temperature means that warming environments will increase the proportion of the energy budget allocated to locomotion unless individuals adjust their movement patterns."

        "abstract": "Optical detection of horizontally polarized light is widespread among aquatic insects. This process usually occurs in the UV or blue spectral ranges. Recently, it was demonstrated that at least one collembolan species, the water springtail (Podura aquatica) also possesses positive polarotaxis to horizontally polarized light. These hexapods are positively phototactic, live on the surface of calm waters and usually accumulate close to the riparian vegetation. In laboratory experiments, we measured the wavelength dependence of phototaxis and polarotaxis of P. aquatica in the 346–744 nm and 421–744 nm ranges, respectively. According to our results, the action spectrum of phototaxis is bimodal with two peaks in the blue (λ1=484 nm) and green-yellow (λ2=570 nm) ranges, while polarotaxis operates in the blue spectral range. For the first time, we show that collembolan polarotaxis functions in the same spectral range as the polarotaxis of many aquatic insects. We present our experiments and discuss the possible ecological significance of our findings."

        "abstract": "Muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) mice carry a deletion in the N2A region of the gene for the muscle protein titin (TTN), shiver at low frequency, fail to maintain body temperatures (Tb) at ambient temperatures (Ta) <34°C, and have reduced body mass and active muscle stiffness in vivo compared with wild-type (WT) siblings. Impaired shivering thermogenesis (ST) could be due to the mutated titin protein causing more compliant muscles. We hypothesized that non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) is impaired. To characterize the response to cold exposure, we measured Tb and metabolic rate (MR) of WT and mdm mice at four nominal temperatures: 20, 24, 29 and 34°C. Subsequently, we stimulated NST with noradrenaline. Manipulation of Ta revealed an interaction between genotype and MR: mdm mice had higher MRs at 29°C and lower MRs at 24°C compared with WT mice. NST capacity was lower in mdm mice than in WT mice. Using MR data from a previous study, we compared MR of mdm mice with MR of Perognathus longimembris, a mouse species of similar body mass. Our results indicated low MR and reduced NST of mdm mice. These were more pronounced than differences between mdm and WT mice owing to body mass effects on MR and capacity for NST. Correcting MR using Q10 showed that mdm mice had lower MRs than size-matched P. longimembris, indicating that mutated N2A titin causes severe thermoregulatory defects at all levels. Direct effects of the titin mutation lead to lower shivering frequency. Indirect effects likely lead to a lower capacity for NST and increased thermal conductance through decreased body size."

        "abstract": "Tetrapod musculoskeletal diversity is usually studied separately in feeding and locomotor systems. However, comparisons between these systems promise important insight into how natural selection deploys the same basic musculoskeletal toolkit – connective tissues, bones, nerves and skeletal muscle – to meet the differing performance criteria of feeding and locomotion. In this study, we compare average joint angular excursions during cyclic behaviors – chewing, walking and running – in a phylogenetic context to explore differences in the optimality criteria of these two systems. Across 111 tetrapod species, average limb-joint angular excursions during cyclic locomotion are greater and more evolutionarily labile than those of the jaw joint during cyclic chewing. We argue that these findings reflect fundamental functional dichotomies between tetrapod locomotor and feeding systems. Tetrapod chewing systems are optimized for precise application of force over a narrower, more controlled and predictable range of displacements, the principal aim being to fracture the substrate, the size and mechanical properties of which are controlled at ingestion and further reduced and homogenized, respectively, by the chewing process. In contrast, tetrapod limbed locomotor systems are optimized for fast and energetically efficient application of force over a wider and less predictable range of displacements, the principal aim being to move the organism at varying speeds relative to a substrate whose geometry and mechanical properties need not become more homogeneous as locomotion proceeds. Hence, the evolution of tetrapod locomotor systems has been accompanied by an increasing diversity of limb-joint excursions, as tetrapods have expanded across a range of locomotor substrates and environments."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/9/jeb185447",
        "abstract": "Humans have evolved the ability to walk very efficiently. Further, humans prefer to walk at speeds that approximately minimize their metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance (i.e. gross cost of transport, COT). This has been found in a variety of population groups and other species. However, these studies were mostly performed on smooth, level ground or on treadmills. We hypothesized that the objective function for walking is more complex than only minimizing the COT. To test this idea, we compared the preferred speeds and the relationships between COT and speed for people walking on both a smooth, level floor and a rough, natural terrain trail. Rough terrain presumably introduces other factors, such as stability, to the objective function. Ten healthy men walked on both a straight, flat, smooth floor and an outdoor trail strewn with rocks and boulders. In both locations, subjects performed five to seven trials at different speeds relative to their preferred speed. The COT–speed relationships were similarly U-shaped for both surfaces, but the COT values on rough terrain were approximately 115% greater. On the smooth surface, the preferred speed (1.24±0.17 m s−1) was not found to be statistically different (P=0.09) than the speed that minimized COT (1.34±0.03 m s−1). On rough terrain, the preferred speed (1.07±0.05 m s−1) was significantly slower than the COT minimum speed (1.13±0.07 m s−1; P=0.02). Because near the optimum speed the COT function is very shallow, these changes in speed result in a small change in COT (0.5%). It appears that the objective function for speed preference when walking on rough terrain includes COT and additional factors such as stability."

        "abstract": "ECG recordings were obtained using an implanted telemetry device from the South American rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus, held under stable conditions without restraining cables or interaction with researchers. Mean heart rate (fH) recovered rapidly (<24 h) from anaesthesia and operative procedures. This preceded a more gradual development of heart rate variability (HRV), with instantaneous fH increasing during each lung ventilation cycle. Atropine injection increased mean fH and abolished HRV. Complete autonomic blockade revealed a cholinergic tonus on the heart of 55% and an adrenergic tonus of 37%. Power spectral analysis of HRV identified a peak at the same frequency as ventilation. This correlation was sustained after temperature changes and it was more evident, marked by a more prominent power spectrum peak, when ventilation is less episodic. This HRV component is homologous to that observed in mammals, termed respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Evidence for instantaneous control of fH indicated rapid conduction of activity in the cardiac efferent nervous supply, as supported by the description of myelinated fibres in the cardiac vagus. Establishment of HRV 10 days after surgical intervention seems a reliable indicator of the re-establishment of control of integrative functions by the autonomic nervous system. We suggest that this criterion could be applied to other animals exposed to natural or imposed trauma, thus improving protocols involving animal handling, including veterinarian procedures."

        "abstract": "Large insects actively ventilate their tracheal system even at rest, using abdominal pumping movements, which are controlled by a central pattern generator (CPG) in the thoracic ganglia. We studied the effects of respiratory gases on the ventilatory rhythm by isolating the thoracic ganglia and perfusing its main tracheae with various respiratory gas mixtures. Fictive ventilation activity was recorded from motor nerves controlling spiracular and abdominal ventilatory muscles. Both hypoxia and hypercapnia increased the ventilation rate, with the latter being much more potent. Sub-threshold hypoxic and hypercapnic levels were still able to modulate the rhythm as a result of interactions between the effects of the two respiratory gases. Additionally, changing the oxygen levels in the bathing saline affected ventilation rate, suggesting a modulatory role for haemolymph oxygen. Central sensing of both respiratory gases as well as interactions of their effects on the motor output of the ventilatory CPG reported here indicate convergent evolution of respiratory control among terrestrial animals of distant taxa."

        "abstract": "Unlike vertebrates, the penaeid shrimp stomach is of ectodermic origin and is thus covered by a cuticle that is sloughed upon molting. It is composed of two chambers, here called the anterior and posterior stomach chambers, ASC and PSC respectively. The PSC contains a filtration structure variously called a pyloric filter, filter press, gastric filter or gastric sieve (GS) and the latter will be used here. The GS resembles an elongated, inverted-V, dome-like, chitinous structure with a midline ridge that is integral to the ventral base of the PSC. The dome surface is covered with a carpet-like layer of minute, comb-like setae bearing laterally-branching setulae. This carpet serves as a selective filter that excludes large partially-digested food particles but allows smaller particles and soluble materials to enter hepatopancreatic ducts that conduct them into the shrimp hepatopancreas (HP) where further digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place. Although the GS function is well known, its exclusion limit for particulate material has not been clearly defined. Using histological and ultra-structure analysis, we show that the GS sieve pore diameter is approximately 0.2-0.7 μm in size, indicating a size exclusion limit (SEL) of substantially less than 1 μm. Using fluorescent microbeads we show that particles of 1 μm diameter could not pass the GS but that those 0.1 μm diameter did pass through to accumulate in longitudinal grooves and move onto the HP where some were internalized by tubule epithelial cells. We found no significant differences in these sizes between the species Penaeus monodon and Penaeus vannamei or between juveniles and adults in P. vannamei. This information will be of value for design of particulate feed ingredients such as nutrients, therapeutic drugs and toxin-absorbing materials that may selectively target the stomach, intestine or HP of cultivated shrimp."

        "abstract": "The embryonic development of parabronchi occurs mainly during the second half of incubation in precocious birds, which makes this phase sensitive to possible morphological modifications induced by O2 supply limitation. Thus, we hypothesized that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development induces morphological changes that remain after hatching. To test this hypothesis, chicken embryos were incubated entirely (21 days) under normoxia or partially under hypoxia (15% O2 during days 12 to 18). Lung structures, including air capillaries, blood capillaries, infundibula, atria, parabronchial lumen, bronchi, blood vessels larger than capillaries (Bv) and interparabronchial tissue (It), in 1- and 10-day-old chicks were analyzed using light microscopy-assisted stereology. Tissue barrier and surface area of air capillaries were measured using electron microscopy-assisted stereology, allowing for calculation of the anatomical diffusion factor. Hypoxia increased the relative volumes of air and blood capillaries, structures directly involved in gas exchange, while decreased the relative volumes of atria in both groups of chicks, and the parabronchial lumen in older chicks. Accordingly, the surface area of the air capillaries and the anatomical diffusion factor were increased under hypoxic incubation. Treatment did not alter total lung volume, relative volumes of infundibula, bronchi, Bv, It, or the tissue barrier of any group. We conclude that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development lead to a morphological remodeling, characterized by increased volume density and respiratory surface area of structures involved in gas exchange at the expense of structures responsible for air conduction in chicks up to 10 days old."

        "abstract": "The central complex, a group of midline neuropils in the insect brain, plays a key role in spatial orientation and navigation. Work in locusts, crickets, dung beetles, bees and butterflies suggests that it harbors a network of neurons which determines the orientation of the insect relative to the pattern of polarized light in the blue sky. In locusts, these ‘compass cells’ also respond to simulated approaching objects. Here, we investigated in the locust Schistocerca gregaria whether compass cells change their activity when the animal experiences large-field visual motion or when the animal is engaged in walking behavior. We recorded intracellularly from these neurons while the tethered animals were allowed to perform walking movements on a slippery surface. We concurrently presented moving grating stimuli from the side or polarized light through a rotating polarizer from above. Large-field motion was combined with simulation of approaching objects to evaluate whether responses differed from those presented on a stationary background. We show for the first time that compass cells are sensitive to large-field motion. Responses to looming stimuli were often more conspicuous during large-field motion. Walking activity influenced spiking rates at all stages of the network. The strength of responses to the plane of polarized light was affected in some compass cells during leg motor activity. The data show that signaling in compass cells of the locust central complex is modulated by visual context and locomotor activity."

        "abstract": "Drosophila Acer (Angiotensin-converting enzyme-related) encodes a member of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) family of metallopeptidases that in mammals play roles in the endocrine regulation of blood homeostasis. ACE is also expressed in adipose tissue, where it is thought to play a role in metabolic regulation. Drosophila ACER is expressed in the adult fat body of the head and abdomen and is secreted into the haemolymph. Acer null mutants have previously been found to have reduced night-time sleep and greater sleep fragmentation. ACER may thus be part of a signalling system linking metabolism with sleep. To further understand the role of ACER in response to diet, we measured sleep and other nutrient-responsive phenotypes in Acer null flies under different dietary conditions. We show that loss of Acer disrupts the normal response of sleep to changes in nutrition. Other nutrient-sensitive phenotypes, including survival and glycogen storage, were also altered in the Acer mutant but lipid storage was not. Although the physiological substrate of the ACER peptidase has not been identified, an alteration of the normal nutrient-dependent control of Drosophila insulin-like peptide 5 protein in the Acer mutant suggests insulin/IGF-like signalling as a candidate pathway modulated by ACER in the nutrient-dependent control of sleep, survival and metabolism."

        "abstract": "For many animals, evolution has selected for complex visual systems despite the high energetic demands associated with maintaining eyes and their processing structures. The metabolic demands of visual systems therefore make them highly sensitive to fluctuations in available oxygen. In the marine environment, oxygen changes over daily, seasonal, and inter-annual time scales and there are large gradients of oxygen with depth. Vision is linked to survival in many marine animals, particularly among the crustaceans, cephalopods, and fish, and early life stages of these groups rely on vision for prey capture, predator detection, and their distribution in the water column. Using in vivo electroretinogram recordings, we show that there is a decrease in retinal sensitivity to light in marine invertebrates when exposed to reduced oxygen availability. We found a 60-100% reduction in retinal responses in the larvae of cephalopods and crustaceans: the market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculatus), tuna crab (Pleuroncodes planipes), and brachyuran crab (Metacarcinus gracilis). A decline in oxygen also decreases the temporal resolution of vision in D. opalescens. These results are the first demonstration that vision in marine invertebrates is highly sensitive to oxygen availability and that the thresholds for visual impairment from reduced oxygen are species-specific. Oxygen-impaired retinal function may change the visual behaviors crucial to survival in these marine larvae. These findings may impact our understanding of species’ vulnerability to ocean oxygen loss and suggest that researchers conducting electrophysiology experiments should monitor oxygen levels, as even small changes in oxygen may affect the results."

Eusocial insects have large colonies where individuals experience a great deal of social interactions with nest mates during all life stages, making them excellent candidates for understanding the effects of social isolation on brain development and behaviour. Here we used the honey bee Apis mellifera to study the effect of social isolation and group size on reward perception and discrimination learning and memory. We confined day old adult workers into three different size groups (1 bee, 8 or 32 bees) for six days during a critical period associated with adult behavioural maturation. We quantified their sucrose responsiveness, their ability to use and remember olfactory cues to discriminate between sucrose and salt (i.e. discrimination learning), and four biogenic amines in the brain. We found that the smaller the group size, the more responsive a worker was to the sucrose reward. Honey bees raised in groups of 32 performed the best in the learning trials and had the highest levels of dopamine. We found no effect of group size on memory. The observed group size effect on learning but not memory supports the hypothesis that social interactions modulate learning through the dopaminergic system."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/early/2019/04/24/jeb.201038",
        "abstract": "Insect pheromones are often derived from fatty acid metabolism. Fatty acid desaturases, enzymes introducing double bonds into fatty acids, are crucial for the biosynthesis of these chemical signals. Δ12-desaturases catalyse the biosynthesis of linoleic acid by introducing a second double bond into oleic acid, but have been identified in only few animal species. Here we report the functional characterisation of two Δ12- desaturases, Nvit_D12a and Nvit_D12b, from the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis (Walker). We demonstrate that Nvit_D12a is expressed in the rectal vesicle of males where they produce a linoleic acid-derived sex pheromone to attract virgin females. 13C-labelling experiments with Urolepis rufipes (Ashmead), a closely related species belonging to the so-called “Nasonia-group”, revealed that females but not males are able to synthesise linoleic acid. U. rufipes males produce an isoprenoid sex pheromone in the same gland and do not depend on linoleic acid for pheromone production. This suggests that Δ12-desaturases, while common in the “Nasonia group”, acquired a specialised function in chemical communication of those species that use linoleic acid as a pheromone precursor. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that insect Δ12-desaturases have evolved repeatedly from Δ9-desaturases in different insect taxa. Hence, insects have developed a way to produce linoleic acid independent of the “Omega”-desaturase subfamily which harbours the eukaryotic Δ12-desaturases known so far."

This is achieved using eyes specialized for discerning fine detail, but there has been minimal research on the capacities that salticids might have for visual performance under low ambient light levels. Here we investigate the capacity of two salticid species, Cyrba algerina from Portugal and C. ocellata from Kenya, to perform two specific visual tasks under low ambient light levels. We used lures made from spiders and midges in prey-identification experiments and mirror images (virtual conspecifics) in rival-identification experiments. These experiments were implemented under a range of ambient light levels (234 cd m−2, 1.35 cd m−2, 0.54 cd m−2, 0.24 cd m−2). In most instances, C. algerina and C. ocellata were proficient at performing both of these visual tasks when ambient light was 234 cd m−2 and 1.35 cd m−2, and a minority performed these tasks at 0.54 cd m−2, but none succeeded when light level was 0.24 cd m−2. C. algerina and C. ocellata made vision-based discriminations under low ambient light levels previously associated with nocturnal species."

        "abstract": "Eggs are ‘multivariate’ in that they contain multiple maternally derived egg components (e.g. hormones, antibodies, mRNA, antioxidants) which are thought to influence offspring phenotype. However, most studies have focused on single egg components and on short-term effects. Here, we simultaneously manipulated two egg components, maternally derived antibodies (MAb) and yolk testosterone, to assess potential synergistic or antagonistic effects on zebra finch offspring phenotype from hatching to sexual maturity. We found no evidence for short- or long-term effects of either MAb or yolk testosterone alone, or their interaction, on hatching mass, size at fledging (tarsus length), body mass at sexual maturity (day 82), chick survival, humoral immune function or any measured female reproductive trait at sexual maturity. There was a positive effect of yolk testosterone, but not MAb, on offspring phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) response at 26 days of age but at 82 days of age, MAb, but not yolk testosterone, had a positive effect on PHA response. There was also a MAb×sex interaction on 30 day chick mass, and a positive effect of yolk testosterone on male courtship behaviour at sexual maturity. However, we found no evidence for synergy, i.e. where offspring treated with both MAb and yolk testosterone had higher trait values than offspring treated with either MAb or yolk testosterone alone for any measured trait. Similarly, evidence for antagonistic (compensatory) effects, where offspring treated with both MAb and yolk testosterone had intermediate trait values compared with offspring treated with either MAb or yolk testosterone alone, was equivocal."

        "abstract": "It is now well established that the intrauterine life environment is of major importance for health during later life. Endurance training during pregnancy is associated with positive metabolic adjustments and beneficial effects on the balance between pro and antioxidant (redox state) in the offspring. Our hypothesis is that these changes could rely on mitochondrial adaptations in the offspring due to modifications of the fetal environment induced by maternal endurance training.Therefore, we compared the liver and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and the redox status of young rats whose mothers underwent moderate endurance training (treadmill running) before and during gestation (T) to those of young rats from untrained mothers (C).Our results show a significant reduction in the spontaneous H2O2 release by liver and muscle mitochondria in the T vs. C rats (p<0.05). These changes are accompanied by alterations in oxygen consumption. Moreover, the percentage of short chain fatty acids increased significantly, in liver mitochondria from T rats. This may lead to improve the fluidity and the flexibility of the membrane.In plasma, GPX activity and protein oxidation are significantly higher in T rats compared to C rats (p<0.05). Such changes in plasma could represent an adaptive signal transmitted from mothers to their offspring.We demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that it is possible to act on the bioenergetic functionning including alterations of the mitochondrial function in the offspring by modifying maternal physical activity before and during pregnancy. These changes could be crucial for the future health of the offspring."

        "abstract": "The metabolism of a living organism (e.g. bacteria, algae, zooplankton) requires a continuous uptake of nutrients from the surrounding environment. However, within local spatial scales, nutrients are quickly used up under dense concentrations of organisms. Here, we report that self-spinning dinoflagellates Symbiodinium sp. (clade E) generate a microscale flow that mitigates competition and enhances the uptake of nutrients from the surrounding environment. Our experimental and theoretical results reveal that this incessant active behavior enhances transport by approximately 80-fold when compared with Brownian motion in living fluids. We found that the tracer ensemble probability density function for displacement is time-dependent, but consists of a Gaussian core and robust exponential tails (so-called non-Gaussian diffusion). This can be explained by interactions of far-field Brownian motions and a near-field entrainment effect along with microscale flows. The contribution of exponential tails sharply increases with algal density, and saturates at a critical density, implying a trade-off between aggregated benefit and negative competition for the spatially self-organized cells. Our work thus shows that active motion and migration of aquatic algae play key roles in diffusive transport and should be included in theoretical and numerical models of physical and biogeochemical ecosystems."

        "abstract": "Marine turtles spend their life at sea and can rest on the seafloor for hours. As air-breathers, the breath-hold capacity  of marine turtles is a function of oxygen (O2) stores, O2 consumption during dives and hypoxia tolerance. However, some physiological adaptations to diving observed in mammals are absent in marine turtles. This study examined cardiovascular responses in loggerhead sea turtles, which have even fewer adaptations to diving than other marine turtles, but can dive for extended durations. Heart rates (fH) of eight undisturbed loggerhead turtles in shallow tanks were measured using self-contained ECG data loggers under five conditions: spontaneous dives, resting motionless on the tank bottom, resting in shallow water with their head out of water, feeding on squid, and swimming at the surface between dives. There was no significant difference between resting fH while resting on the bottom of the tank, diving or resting in shallow water with their head out of water. fH rose as soon as turtles began to move and was highest between dives when turtles were swimming at the surface. These results suggest cardiovascular responses in captive loggerhead turtles are driven by activity and apneic fH is not reduced by submergence under these conditions."

        "abstract": "The capacity and condition under which the lateral transfer of olfactory memory is possible in insects is still debated. Here, we present evidence in two species of honeybees, Apis mellifera and Apis dorsata, consistent with the lack of ability to transfer olfactory associative memory in a proboscis extension response (PER) associative conditioning paradigm, where the untrained antenna is blocked by an insulating coat. We show that the olfactory system on each side of the bee can learn and retrieve information independently and the retrieval using the antenna on the side contralateral to the trained one is not affected by the training. Using the setup in which the memory on the contralateral side has been reported at 3 h after training, we see that the memory is available on the contralateral side immediately after training. In the same setup, coating the antenna with an insulator on the training side does not prevent learning, pointing to a possible insufficiency of the block of odor stimuli in this setup. Moreover, the behavior of the bee as a whole can be predicted if the sides are assumed to learn and store independently, and the organism as a whole is able to retrieve the memory if either of the sides have the memory."

        "abstract": "Many snakes live in deserts, forests and river valleys and traverse challenging 3-D terrain such as rocks, felled trees and rubble, with obstacles as large as themselves and variable surface properties. By contrast, apart from branch cantilevering, burrowing, swimming and gliding, laboratory studies of snake locomotion have focused on locomotion on simple flat surfaces. Here, to begin to understand snake locomotion in complex 3-D terrain, we studied how the variable kingsnake, a terrestrial generalist, traversed a large step of variable surface friction and step height (up to 30% snout–vent length). The snake traversed by partitioning its body into three sections with distinct functions. Body sections below and above the step oscillated laterally on horizontal surfaces for propulsion, whereas the body section in between cantilevered in a vertical plane to bridge the large height increase. As the animal progressed, these three sections traveled down its body, conforming overall body shape to the step. In addition, the snake adjusted the partitioned gait in response to increase in step height and decrease in surface friction, at the cost of reduced speed. As surface friction decreased, body movement below and above the step changed from a continuous lateral undulation with little slip to an intermittent oscillatory movement with much slip, and initial head lift-off became closer to the step. Given these adjustments, body partitioning allowed the snake to be always stable, even when initially cantilevering but before reaching the surface above. Such a partitioned gait may be generally useful for diverse, complex 3-D terrain."

        "abstract": "Triggerfishes and filefishes (Balistoidea) use balistiform locomotion to power steady swimming with their dorsal and anal fins, and transition to a gait dominated by body and caudal fin (BCF) kinematics at high speeds. Fin and body shapes are predicted to be strong determinants of swimming performance and gait transitions. The goal of this study was to combine morphometrics and critical swimming tests to explore the relationships between fin and body shapes and swimming performance in a phylogenetic context in order to understand the evolution of balistiform swimming. Among 13 species of balistoid fishes, those with high aspect ratio fins tended to achieve higher critical swimming speeds than fishes with low aspect ratio fins. Species with long, large median fins and wide caudal peduncles used the balistiform gait alone for a larger percentage of their total critical swimming speed than fishes with short, small median fins and narrow caudal peduncles. Although analyses revealed overall positive relationships between median fin aspect ratios and gait transition speeds, fishes on both ends of the aspect ratio spectrum achieved higher swimming speeds using the balistiform gait alone than fishes with median fins of intermediate aspect ratios. Each species is specialized for taking advantage of one gait, with balistiform specialists possessing long, large median fins capable of the large power requirements of high-speed swimming using the median fins alone, while BCF specialists possess short, small median fins, ill-suited for powering high-speed balistiform locomotion, but narrow caudal peduncles capable of efficient caudal fin oscillations to power high-speed locomotion."

The results showed that corticotrophin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, dopamine, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine concentration in all ammonia-N groups increased significantly between 3-12 h. Cortisol increased significantly between 3-24 h. All hormones except crustacean hyperglycemic hormone were reduced to control levels. mRNA abundance of guanylyl cyclase increased significantly during the experiment. Dopamine receptor D4 and α2 adrenergic receptor mRNA abundance in treatments decreased significantly at the beginning, and eventually returned to the control level, whereas mRNA abundance of 5-HT7 receptor increased significantly only within the first 12 h. Changes of protein kinases (PKA, PKG) mRNA abundance were similar to the patterns of biogenic amines and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone, peaking at 6 h and 12 h respectively, while PKC decreased within 24 h. 14-3-3 protein, FXYD2 and cAMP-response element binding protein mRNA abundance of treatments increased significantly and peaked at 6 h. β-catenin and T-cell factor mRNA abundance increased significantly throughout the experiment and peaked at 12 h. The up-regulation of Rh protein, K+-channel, Na+/K+-ATPase, V-type H+-ATPase and vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) mRNA, together with down-regulation of Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter mRNA indicated an adjustment of general branchial ion-/ammonia-regulatory mechanisms. Meanwhile, hemolymph ammonia concentration was significantly increased in most ammonia-N exposure groups. Histological investigation revealed the hepatopancreatic damage caused by ammonia-N. The results suggest hormones, biogenic amines and Wnt/β-catenin play a principal role in adapting to ammonia-N exposure and facilitating ammonia transport."

        "abstract": "Landmark-guided navigation is a common behavioral strategy for way-finding, yet prior studies have not examined how animals collect sensory information to discriminate landmark features. We investigated this question in animals that rely on active sensing to guide navigation. Four echolocating bats (Eptesicus fuscus) were trained to use an acoustic landmark to find and navigate through a net opening for a food reward. In experimental trials, an object serving as a landmark was placed adjacent to a net opening and an object serving as a distractor was placed next to a barrier (covered opening). The location of the opening, barrier and objects were moved between trials, but the spatial relationships between the landmark and opening, and between the distractor and barrier were maintained. In probe trials, the landmark was placed next to a barrier, while the distractor was placed next to the opening, to test whether the bats relied on the landmark to guide navigation. Vocal and flight behaviors were recorded with an array of ultrasound microphones and high-speed infrared motion-capture cameras. All bats successfully learned to use the landmark to guide navigation through the net opening. Probe trials yielded an increase in both the time to complete the task and the number of net crashes, confirming that the bats relied largely on the landmark to find the net opening. Further, landmark acoustic distinctiveness influenced performance in probe trials and sonar inspection behaviors. Analyses of the animals' vocal behaviors also revealed differences between call features of bats inspecting landmarks compared with distractors, suggesting increased sonar attention to objects used to guide navigation."

        "abstract": "The metabolic cost per unit force is generally thought to increase with the mechanical work done by the muscle fibres. It is currently unclear how the metabolic cost of doing alternating positive and negative muscle fibre mechanical work relates to the metabolic cost of doing zero muscle fibre mechanical work at similar muscle force. The current study aimed to investigate this issue by comparing in vivo metabolic power between a dynamic and an isometric near-constant force production task. In both tasks, participants performed periodic movement about the knee joint in the gravitational field. Therefore, net external mechanical work was constrained to be zero. The tasks mainly differed from each other in average positive knee joint mechanical power, which was 4.3±0.5 W per leg during the dynamic task and 0.1±0.1 W per leg during the isometric task. Knee extension torque was near-constant around 15.2±1.7 N m during the dynamic task and around 15.7±1.7 N m during the isometric task. Owing to near-constant knee extension torque, quadriceps tendon length was presumably nearly constant during both tasks. Therefore, knee joint mechanical work was predominantly done by the muscle fibres in both tasks. Average gross metabolic power was 3.22±0.46 W kg−1 during the dynamic task and 2.13±0.36 W kg−1 during the isometric task. Because tasks differed mainly in the amount of positive muscle fibre mechanical work, these results imply that the metabolic cost of near-constant force production in vivo at zero net mechanical work can be reduced by minimizing positive muscle fibre mechanical work."

        "abstract": "Squids display a wide range of swimming behaviors, including powerful escape jets mediated by the giant axon system. For California market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), maintaining essential behaviors like the escape response during environmental variations poses a major challenge as this species often encounters intrusions of cold, hypoxic offshore waters in its coastal spawning habitats. To explore the effects of hypoxia on locomotion and the underlying neural mechanisms, we made in vivo recordings of giant axon activity and simultaneous pressure inside the mantle cavity during escape jets in squid exposed to acute progressive hypoxia followed by return to normal dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (normoxia). Compared with those in normoxia (>8 mg l−1 DO), escape jets were unchanged in moderate hypoxia (4 and 2 mg l−1 DO), but giant axon activity and associated mantle contractions significantly decreased while neuromuscular latency increased under severe hypoxia (0.5 mg l−1 DO). Animals that survived exposure to severe hypoxia reliably produced escape jets under such conditions and fully recovered as more oxygen became available. The reduction in neuromuscular output under hypoxia suggests that market squid may suppress metabolic activity to maintain sufficient behavioral output, a common strategy in many hypoxia-tolerant species. The ability to recover from the deleterious effects of hypoxia suggests that this species is well adapted to cope with coastal hypoxic events that commonly occur in Monterey Bay, unless these events become more severe in the future as climate change progresses."

        "abstract": "Highly unsaturated fatty acids of the omega-3 series (HUFA) are major constituents of cell membranes, yet are poorly synthesised de novo by consumers. Their production, mainly supported by aquatic microalgae, has been decreasing with global change. The consequences of such reductions may be profound for ectotherm consumers, as temperature tightly regulates the HUFA content in cell membranes, maintaining their functionality. Integrating individual, tissue and molecular approaches, we examined the consequences of the combined effects of temperature and HUFA depletion on the key cardio-respiratory functions of the golden grey mullet, an ectotherm grazer of high ecological importance. For 4 months, fish were exposed to two contrasting HUFA diets [4.8% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on dry matter (DM) versus 0.2% EPA+DHA on DM] at 12 and 20°C. Ventricular force development coupled with gene expression profiles measured on cardiac muscle suggest that combining HUFA depletion with warmer temperatures leads to: (1) a proliferation of sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ channels and (2) a higher force-generating ability by increasing extracellular Ca2+ influx via sarcolemmal channels when the heart has to sustain excessive effort due to stress and/or exercise. At the individual scale, these responses were associated with a greater aerobic scope, maximum metabolic rate and net cost of locomotion, suggesting the higher energy cost of this strategy. This impaired cardiac performance could have wider consequences for other physiological performance such as growth, reproduction or migration, all of which greatly depend on heart function."

Long-term light alterations can also occur as a result of natural and anthropogenic stressors, as well as management interventions such as coral transplantation. Although short-term photophysiological responses are relatively well understood in corals, little information is available regarding photoacclimation dynamics over weeks of altered light availability. We coupled photophysiology and metabolomic profiling to explore changes that accompany longer-term photoacclimation in a key Great Barrier Reef coral species, Acropora muricata. High light (HL)- and low light (LL)-acclimated corals were collected from the reef and reciprocally exposed to high and low light ex situ. Rapid light curves using pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry revealed photophysiological acclimation of LL corals to HL and HL corals to LL within 21 days. A subset of colonies sampled at 7 and 21 days for untargeted LC-MS and GC-MS metabolomic profiling revealed metabolic reorganization before acclimation was detected using PAM fluorometry. Metabolomic shifts were more pronounced for LL to HL corals than for their HL to LL counterparts. Compounds driving metabolomic separation between HL-exposed and LL control colonies included amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids and sterols. Reduced glycerol and campesterol suggest decreased translocation of photosynthetic products from symbiont to host in LL to HL corals, with concurrent increases in fatty acid abundance indicating reliance on stored lipids for energy. We discuss how these data provide novel insight into environmental regulation of metabolism and implications for management strategies that drive rapid changes in light availability."

        "abstract": "In complex biosonar scenes, the delay of echoes represents the spatial distribution of objects in depth. To avoid overlap of echo streams from successive broadcasts, individual echolocation sounds should only be emitted after all echoes of previous sounds have returned. However, close proximity of obstacles demands rapid pulse updates for steering to avoid collisions, which often means emitting a new sound before all of the previous echoes have returned. When two echo streams overlap, there is ambiguity about assigning echoes to the corresponding broadcasts. In laboratory tests of flight in dense, cluttered scenes, four species of echolocating bats exhibited different patterns of pulse emissions to accommodate potential pulse-echo ambiguity. Miniopterus fuliginosus emitted individual FM pulses only after all echoes of previous pulses had returned, with no alternating between long and short intervals. Pipistrellus abramus and Eptesicus fuscus alternated between emitting long FM pulse intervals to receive all echoes before the next pulse, and short intervals to update the rapidly changing scene while accepting partial overlap of successive echo streams. Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon transmitted CF/FM pulses in alternating short and long intervals, usually two to four closely spaced sounds that produced overlapping echo streams, followed by a longer interval that separated echo streams. Rhinolophus f. nippon is a statistical outlier from the three FM species, which are more similar to each other. The repeated overlap of CF/FM echo streams suggests that CF components have a distinct role in rejection of clutter and mitigation of ambiguity."

        "abstract": "Colonization of novel habitats often requires plasticity or adaptation to local conditions. There is a critical need to maintain hydration in terrestrial environments having limited water. Atypical populations of Florida cottonmouth snakes, Agkistrodon conanti, inhabit continental islands with no permanent sources of fresh water. Here we report investigations related to how these insular snakes maintain water balance considering the mainland conspecifics are semi-aquatic and typically associate with freshwater mesic habitats. We tested three hypotheses related to water relations of insular populations of cottonmouths compared to those on the mainland. (1) Voluntary drinking of fresh water in free-ranging insular snakes should reflect a relationship to recency of rainfall more strongly than in mainland snakes. (2) Insular snakes will tolerate greater dehydration before drinking than will mainland snakes. (3) Insular snakes will avoid drinking seawater more strongly than will those from the mainland. Between 2001 and 2018, we quantitatively estimated the hydration status of 337 individual cottonmouths from insular populations and 30 cottonmouths from mainland Florida, as judged by the tendency of wild-caught snakes to drink fresh water immediately following capture. We found that insular cottonmouths had a higher incidence of dehydration than did mainland cottonmouths (64% vs. 23%), and the hydration status of the insular snakes correlated with patterns of precipitation. We also determined experimentally the dehydration threshold for drinking fresh water in insular (mean=−5.64±4.3%, n=34) and mainland cottonmouths (mean=−5.74±4.5%, n=21), and these were not significantly different. Discrimination tests for drinking serially from a graded series of brackish water showed that mainland snakes did not discriminate against the highest brackish value (10.5 ppt or 30% seawater), whereas insular snakes showed a preference for <15% seawater. Naïve neonates from insular and mainland cohorts behaved similarly. The preference of insular snakes for fresh water represents an important aspect of the maintenance of water balance that differs from the mainland conspecifics and is likely a habituated or adaptive response to dependence on rainfall."

        "abstract": "The song of the adult male zebra finch is a well-studied example of a learned motor sequence. Song bouts begin with a variable number of introductory notes (INs) before actual song production. Previous studies have shown that INs progress from a variable initial state to a stereotyped final state before each song. This progression is thought to represent motor preparation, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we assessed the role of sensory feedback in the progression of INs to song. We found that the mean number of INs before song and the progression of INs to song were not affected by removal of two sensory feedback pathways (auditory or proprioceptive). In both feedback-intact and feedback-deprived birds, the presence of calls (other non-song vocalizations), just before the first IN, was correlated with fewer INs before song and an initial state closer to song. Finally, the initial IN state correlated with the time to song initiation. Overall, these results show that INs do not require real-time sensory feedback for progression to song. Rather, our results suggest that changes in IN features and their transition to song are controlled by internal neural processes, possibly involved in getting the brain ready to initiate a learned movement sequence."

Molecular characterizations reveal that SGLT1-like of T. squamosa could transport urea, in addition to glucose, as other SGLT1s do. It has an apical localization in the epithelium of ctenidial filaments and water channels, and the apical anti-SGLT1-like immunofluorescence was stronger in individuals exposed to light than to darkness. Furthermore, the protein abundance of SGLT1-like increased significantly in the ctenidium of individuals exposed to light for 12 h, although the SGLT1-like transcript level remained unchanged. As expected, T. squamosa could perform light-enhanced glucose absorption, which was impeded by exogenous urea. These results denote the close relationships between light-enhanced glucose absorption and light-enhanced SGLT1-like expression in the ctenidium of T. squamosa. Although glucose absorption could be trivial compared with the donation of photosynthates from zooxanthellae in symbiotic adults, SGLT1-like might be essential for the survival of aposymbiotic larvae, leading to its retention in the symbiotic stage. A priori, glucose uptake through SGLT1-like might be augmented by the surface microbiome through nutrient cycling, and the absorbed glucose could partially fulfill the metabolic needs of the ctenidial cells. Additionally, SGLT1-like could partake in urea absorption, as T. squamosa is known to conduct light-enhanced urea uptake to benefit the nitrogen-deficient zooxanthellae."

        "abstract": "The common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a well-characterized model for neurological disorders and is widely used to investigate the biology of aging, stress tolerance and pleiotropy. The foraging (for) gene encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), which has been implicated in several behavioral phenotypes including feeding, sleep, learning and memory, and environmental stress tolerance. We used the well-established Drosophila activity monitor (DAM) to investigate the effects of the conserved NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway on functional senescence. Our results show that the polymorphic for gene confers protection during low oxygen stress at the expense of longevity and a decline in locomotor activity with age in D. melanogaster, which suggests a novel role for the PKG pathway in healthy aging and senescence."

        "abstract": "The swamp eel (Monopterus albus) uses its buccal cavity to air-breathe while the gills are strongly reduced. They burrow into mud during the dry season, are highly tolerant of air-exposure, and experience severe hypoxia in both their natural habitat and in aquaculture. To study their ability to compensate for respiratory acidosis, we implanted catheters to sample both arterial blood and urine during hypercapnia (4% CO2) in either water and air, or during whole animal air-exposure. These hypercapnic challenges caused an immediate reduction in arterial pH, followed by progressive compensation through a marked elevation of plasma HCO3− over the course of 72h. There was no appreciable rise in urinary acid excretion in fish exposed to hypercapnia in water, although urine pH was reduced and ammonia excretion did increase. In the air-exposed fish, however, hypercapnia was attended by a large elevation of ammonia in the urine and a large rise in titratable acid excretion. The time course of the increased renal acid excretion overlapped with the time period required to elevate plasma HCO3−, and we estimate that the renal compensation contributed significantly to whole body acid-base compensation."

        "abstract": "The interaction between the gut microbiota (GM) and the brain has led to the concept of the microbiota-gut-brain axis but data in birds remain scarce. We tested the hypothesis that colonization of germ-free chicks from a quail line selected for a high emotional reactivity (E+) with GM from a line with low emotional reactivity (E-) would reduce their emotional behaviour in comparison with germ-free chicks from E+ line colonized with GM from the same E+ line. The GM composition analysis of both groups revealed a shift in term of microbial diversity and richness between Day 21 and Day 35 and the GM of the two groups of quails were closer to each other at Day 35 than at Day 21 at a phylum level. Quails that received GM from the E- line expressed a lower emotional reactivity than the quails colonized by GM from the E+line in the tonic immobility and the novel environment tests proceeded during the second week of age. This result was reversed in a second tonic immobility test and an open-field run two weeks later. These behavioural and GM modifications over time could be the consequence of the resilience of the GM to recover its equilibrium present in the E+ host, which is in part driven by the host genotype. This study shows for the first time that a gut microbiota transfer can influence emotional reactivity in Japanese quails strengthening the existence of a microbiota-gut-brain axis in this species of bird."

        "abstract": "Snapshot analyses have demonstrated dramatic intraspecific variation in the degree of brain sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Although brain SSD is believed to be generated by the sex-specific cognitive demands of reproduction, the relative roles of developmental and population-specific contributions to variation in brain SSD remain little studied. Using a common garden experiment, we tested for sex-specific changes in brain anatomy over the breeding cycle in three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) sampled from four locations in northern Europe. We found that the male brain increased in size (ca. 24%) significantly more than the female brain towards breeding, and that the resulting brain SSD was similar (ca. 20%) for all populations over the breeding cycle. Our findings support the notion that the stickleback brain is highly plastic and changes over the breeding cycle, especially in males, likely as an adaptive response to the cognitive demands of reproduction (e.g. nest construction and parental care). The results also provide evidence to suggest that breeding-related changes in brain size may be the reason for the widely varying estimates of brain SSD across studies of this species, cautioning against interpreting brain size measurements from a single time point as fixed/static."

        "abstract": "Cranial kinesis refers to intracranial movements in the vertebrate skull that do not concern the jaw joint, the middle ear, or the hypobranchial skeleton. Different kinds of cranial kinesis have been reported for lizards, including mesokinesis, metakinesis, amphikinesis (simultaneous meso- and metakinesis), and streptostyly. Streptostyly is considered relatively widespread within lizards, while mesokinesis has been documented only for geckos, varanids, and anguids. The present study investigates cranial kinesis in the miniaturised scincid Ablepharus kitaibelii by integrating morphological and experimental data. Based on microCT, we provide a description of skull osteology. Cranial joints were studied with histology, which results in the first detailed description of cranial joint histology for a member of the Scincidae. Taken together, morphological data indicates a high potential for amphikinesis and streptostyly, which was also corroborated by skull manipulations. High-speed cinematography demonstrated that mesokinesis occurs during food uptake, processing, and intraoral transport cycles. Bite force measurements showed prolonged and reasonably hard biting even at large gape. Based on this data we formulate a model of the amphikinetic Ablepharus skull mechanism, which provides an extension of Frazzetta's quadric-crank model by placing a special emphasis on metakinesis. According to this model, we hypothesize that metakinetic intracranial movements may provide a means for reducing strain in jaw adductor muscles. Presented hypotheses can be addressed and tested in future studies."

        "abstract": "Nutrition is involved in regulating multiple aspects of honey bee biology such as caste, immunity, lifespan, growth and behavioral development. Deformed wing virus (DWV) is a major pathogenic factor which threatens honey bee populations, and its replication is regulated by the nutrition status and immune response of honey bees. The alimentary canal of the honey bee is home to a diverse microbial community that provides essential nutrients and serves to bolster immune responses. However, to what extent gut bacteria affect honey bee nutrition metabolism and immunity with respect to DWV has not been investigated fully. In this study, newly emerged worker bees were subjected to four diets that contained (1) pollen, (2) pollen and antibiotics, (3) neither pollen nor antibiotics or (4) antibiotics alone. The expression level of two nutrition genes target of rapamycin (tor) and insulin like peptide (ilp1), one nutritional marker gene vitellogenin (vg), five major royal jelly protein genes (mrjp1–5), one antimicrobial peptide regulating gene relish (rel), and DWV virus titer and its replication intermediate, negative RNA strand, were determined by qRT-PCR from the honey bees at 7 days post-antibiotic treatment. Additionally, honey bee head mass and survival rate were measured. We observed that antibiotics decreased the expression of tor and rel, and increased DWV titer and its replication activity. Expression of ilp1, mrjp1–5 and vg, and honey bee head mass were also reduced compared with bees on a pollen diet. Antibiotics also caused a significant drop in survivorship, which could be rescued by addition of pollen to the diet. Of importance, pollen could partially rescue the loss of vg and mrjp2 while also increasing the head mass of antibiotic-treated bees. Our results illuminate the roles of bacteria in honey bee nutrition, metabolism and immunity, which confer the ability to inhibit virus replication, extend honey bee lifespan and improve overall health."

        "abstract": "Measurements of energy use, and its scaling with size, are critical to understanding how organisms accomplish myriad tasks. For example, energy budgets are central to game theory models of assessment during contests and underlie patterns of feeding behavior. Clear tests connecting energy to behavioral theory require measurements of the energy use of single individuals for particular behaviors. Many species of mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda: Crustacea) use elastic energy storage to power high-speed strikes that they deliver to opponents during territorial contests and to hard–shelled prey while feeding. We compared the scaling of strike kinematics and energetics between feeding and contests in the mantis shrimp Neogonodactylus bredini. We filmed strikes with high-speed video, measured strike velocity and used a mathematical model to calculate strike energy. During contests, strike velocity did not scale with body size but strike energy scaled positively with size. Conversely, while feeding, strike velocity decreased with increasing size and strike energy did not vary according to body size. Individuals most likely achieved this strike variation through differential compression of their exoskeletal spring prior to the strike. Post hoc analyses found that N. bredini used greater velocity and energy when striking larger opponents, yet variation in prey size was not accompanied by varying strike velocity or energetics. Our estimates of energetics inform prior tests of contest and feeding behavior in this species. More broadly, our findings elucidate the role behavioral context plays in measurements of animal performance."

        "abstract": "Control of wing shape is believed to be a key feature that allows most birds to produce aerodynamically efficient flight behaviors and high maneuverability. Anatomical organization of intrinsic wing muscles suggests specific roles for the different motor elements in wing shape modulation, but testing these hypothesized functions requires challenging measurements of muscle activation and strain patterns, and force dynamics. The wing muscles that have been best characterized during flight are the elbow muscles of the pigeon (Columba livia). In vivo studies during different flight modes revealed variation in strain profile, activation timing and duration, and contractile cycle frequency of the humerotriceps, suggesting that this muscle may alter wing shape in diverse ways. To examine the multifunction potential of the humerotriceps, we developed an in situ work loop approach to measure how activation duration and contractile cycle frequency affected muscle work and power across the full range of activation onset times. The humerotriceps produced predominantly net negative power, likely due to relatively long stimulus durations, indicating that it absorbs work, but the work loop shapes also suggest varying degrees of elastic energy storage and release. The humerotriceps consistently exhibited positive and negative instantaneous power within a single contractile cycle, across all treatments. When combined with previous in vivo studies, our results indicate that both within and across contractile cycles, the humerotriceps can dynamically shift among roles of actuator, brake, and stiff or compliant spring, based on activation properties that vary with flight mode."

        "abstract": "Insects have a gas-filled respiratory system, which provides a challenge for those that have become aquatic secondarily. Diving beetles (Dytiscidae) use bubbles on the surface of their bodies to supply O2 for their dives and passively gain O2 from the water. However, these bubbles usually require replenishment at the water's surface. A highly diverse assemblage of subterranean dytiscids has evolved in isolated calcrete aquifers of Western Australia with limited/no access to an air–water interface, raising the question of how they are able to respire. We explored the hypothesis that they use cutaneous respiration by studying the mode of respiration in three subterranean dytiscid species from two isolated aquifers. The three beetle species consume O2 directly from the water, but they lack structures on their bodies that could have respiratory function. They also have a lower metabolic rate than other insects. O2 boundary layers surrounding the beetles are present, indicating that O2 diffuses into the surface of their bodies via cutaneous respiration. Cuticle thickness measurements and other experimental results were incorporated into a mathematical model to understand whether cutaneous respiration limits beetle size. The model indicates that the cuticle contributes considerably to resistance in the O2 cascade. As the beetles become larger, their metabolic scope narrows, potentially limiting their ability to allocate energy to mating, foraging and development at sizes above approximately 5 mg. However, the ability of these beetles to utilise cutaneous respiration has enabled the evolution of the largest assemblage of subterranean dytiscids in the world."

        "abstract": "An abundant food supply is crucial to reproductive performance, as shown by restricted food availability experiments, in small-sized vertebrates including birds. However, whether daily feeding times affect reproduction is largely unknown. The present study investigated the effects of daily food availability times on reproductive performance and quality of eggs and offspring survivors in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). In randomly paired birds kept under a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle for about 52 weeks, food availability period was restricted to 4 h in the morning [morning food availability (FA) group] or evening (evening FA group), with controls provided with food ad libitum; thus, the daily food deprivation period began after 4 h of food availability in the morning food access group and was continuous with night-time starvation in the evening food access group. Both food restrictions adversely affected reproductive health, as shown by reduced sex steroid and mesotocin levels, but not general metabolism, as indicated by the absence of a difference in thyroxin and triiodothyronine levels. Restricting food access to a 4 h period negatively affected reproductive performance, although there were differences between pairs in the morning and evening FA groups. In particular, there was delayed onset of reproduction and compromised reproductive success in evening FA but not in morning FA pairs; conversely, offspring health was severely compromised in morning FA but not in evening FA group pairs. Furthermore, morning FA group females were in better health, implying a sex bias in parental food provisioning. Overall, we demonstrate trade-off of ‘quantity’ (number of offspring produced and/or survived) for ‘quality’ (how healthy offspring were) in response to daily food availability times in zebra finches, which, much like humans, are diurnal and retain the ability to reproduce throughout the year."

        "abstract": "During walking, the leg motor system must continually adjust to changes in mechanical conditions, such as the inclination of the ground. To understand the underlying control, it is important to know how changes in leg muscle activity relate to leg kinematics (movements) and leg dynamics (forces, torques). Here, we studied these parameters in hindlegs of stick insects (Carausius morosus) during level and uphill/downhill (±45 deg) walking, using a combination of electromyography, 3D motion capture and ground reaction force measurements. We find that some kinematic parameters including leg joint angles and body height vary across walking conditions. However, kinematics vary little compared with dynamics: horizontal leg forces and torques at the thorax–coxa joint (leg protraction/retraction) and femur–tibia joint (leg flexion/extension) tend to be stronger during uphill walking and are reversed in sign during downhill walking. At the thorax–coxa joint, the different mechanical demands are met by adjustments in the timing and magnitude of antagonistic muscle activity. Adjustments occur primarily in the first half of stance after the touch-down of the leg. When insects transition from level to incline walking, the characteristic adjustments in muscle activity occur with the first step of the leg on the incline, but not in anticipation. Together, these findings indicate that stick insects adjust leg muscle activity on a step-by-step basis so as to maintain a similar kinematic pattern under different mechanical demands. The underlying control might rely primarily on feedback from leg proprioceptors signaling leg position and movement."

        "abstract": "Striking variation in melanin coloration within natural populations is likely due to the different fitness outcomes of alternative phenotypes in varying environmental conditions. There are two types of melanin: eumelanins yield blackish hues, whereas pheomelanins yield reddish hues. The production of eumelanins requires low levels of glutathione (GSH), which is the most important intracellular antioxidant, whereas the production of pheomelanins requires high levels of GSH. We investigated the oxidative status of male pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) with different degrees of melanin coloration under different temperatures during the nestling period. Moreover, we assessed the oxidative status of offspring in relation to their biological or foster father's melanin coloration and ambient temperature. To separate offspring genotype effects and paternal effects in different temperatures, we used a partial cross-foster design. The temperature differently affected the oxidative status of differently colored male pied flycatchers and their foster offspring. When the weather was relatively cold, black males had higher glutathione S-transferase levels compared with brown males, indicating enhanced stress in black males. Foster offspring of black males had a lower ratio between reduced and oxidized GSH followed by higher total amount of GSH than foster offspring of brown males. Thus, foster offspring of black males seem to suffer from oxidative stress under relatively cold weather compared with those of brown males, and vice versa under relatively warm weather. Although differently colored males experienced changes in their oxidative status under different temperatures, the link between paternal melanin coloration and offspring oxidative stress appears to be environmentally induced."

        "abstract": "Several studies show effects of yolk androgens in avian eggs on the phenotype of the offspring. Yolk hormone concentrations decline strongly within the first few days of incubation. Although early embryonic uptake of yolk androgens is suggested by the presence of radioactivity in the embryo when eggs are injected with radiolabelled androgens, these studies do not verify the chemical identity of radioactive compound(s), although it is known that these androgens can be metabolized substantially. By using stable isotope-labelled testosterone and androstenedione in combination with mass spectrometry, enabling verification of the exact molecular identity of labelled compounds in the embryo, we found that after 5 days of incubation the androgens were not taken up by the embryo. However, their concentrations in the entire yolk albumen homogenates declined strongly, even when corrected for dilution by albumen and water. Our results indicate metabolism of maternal androgens, very likely to 5β-androstane-3α,17β-diol, etiocholanolone and their conjugated forms. The results imply that the effects of increased exposure of the embryo to maternal androgens take place either before this early conversion or are mediated by these metabolites with an as yet unknown function, opening new avenues for understanding hormone-mediated maternal effects in vertebrates."

        "abstract": "Excitation–contraction coupling in vertebrate hearts is underpinned by calcium (Ca2+) release from Ca2+ release units (CRUs). CRUs are formed by clusters of channels called ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) within the cardiomyocyte. Distances between CRUs influence the diffusion of Ca2+, thus influencing the rate and strength of excitation–contraction coupling. Avian myocytes lack T-tubules, so Ca2+ from surface CRUs (peripheral couplings, PCs) must diffuse to internal CRU sites of the corbular SR (cSR) during centripetal propagation. Despite this, avian hearts achieve higher contractile rates and develop greater contractile strength than many mammalian hearts, which have T-tubules to provide simultaneous activation of the Ca2+ signal through the myocyte. We used 3D electron tomography to test the hypothesis that the intracellular distribution of CRUs in the avian heart permits faster and stronger contractions despite the absence of T-tubules. Nearest edge–edge distances between PCs and cSR, and geometric information including surface area and volume of individual cSR, were obtained for each cardiac chamber of the white leghorn chicken. Computational modelling was then used to establish a relationship between CRU distance and cell activation time in the avian heart. Our data suggest that cSR clustered close together along the Z-line is vital for rapid propagation of the Ca2+ signal from the cell periphery to the cell centre, which would aid in the strong and fast contractions of the avian heart."

Yet, morph-specific costs and benefits related to different life-history strategies remain unclear. Here, we examined in the polymorphic Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) whether markers of somatic maintenance (body mass, oxidative status and telomere length) differed between red- and black-headed birds under energetically demanding conditions (during heatwaves of different intensity, and during moult or breeding following heatwaves). During heatwaves, red-headed birds showed a homogeneous response, as males and females initially tended to gain mass and had reduced plasma hydroperoxide levels (a marker of oxidative damage) irrespective of heatwave intensity. In contrast, black-headed birds showed a stronger and more heterogeneous response, as black-headed males gained mass at the beginning of the thermoneutral heatwave and showed stable oxidative status, whereas black-headed females lost mass and tended to show higher hydroperoxide levels at the end of the thermocritical heatwave. Following heatwaves, we found morph-specific oxidative costs owing to moult or reproduction, with oxidative markers varying only in black-headed birds. Again, oxidative markers varied differently in black-headed males and females, as plasma antioxidant capacity decreased in moulting or breeding females, whereas males showed higher hydroperoxide levels with larger broods. For the first time, our study highlights that within polymorphic species, some individuals appear more vulnerable than others when coping with energetically demanding conditions. In the context of climate change, such differential effects may ultimately alter the currently observed balance between morphs and sexes within natural populations."

The variational properties of b have been debated, but very few studies have tested for genetic variance in b, and none have tested for a genotype-by-environment (G×E) interaction in b. Consequently, the short-term evolutionary potentials of both b and its phenotypic plasticity remain unknown. Using 10 clones of a population of Daphnia magna, we estimated the genetic variance in b and assessed whether a G×E interaction affected b. We measured MR on juveniles of different sizes reared and measured at three temperatures (17, 22 and 28°C). Overall, b decreased with increasing temperature. We found no evidence of genetic variance in b at any temperature, and thus no G×E interaction in b. However, we found a significant G×E interaction in size-specific MR. Using simulations, we show how this G×E interaction can generate genetic variation in the ontogenetic allometric slope of animals experiencing directional changes in temperature during growth. This suggests that b can evolve despite having limited genetic variation at constant temperatures."

Individuals acclimated to 0°C showed much lower values than the other two acclimation treatments (15°C and fluctuating 0-15°C). Performance breadth (the index of the breadth of the curve, Tbr) typically showed little response to acclimation. None of the traits of the supralittoral species were affected by acclimation treatment. Responses to stable and fluctuating temperature treatments were similar. Our findings also revealed that the mean estimated activation energy 0.40±0.015 eV (mean±s.e.) was lower than for other herbivores, the category to which these weevils belong, suggesting that some form of compensation in the rate-temperature relationship may be evident. Thus, we typically found support for the warmer is better hypothesis for acclimation of locomotor performance, though some compensation is evident."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/early/2019/03/29/jeb.199844",
        "abstract": "Desert ants and honey bees start foraging when they are few days old, and subsequently increase their foraging effort and the amount of foraged food. This could be an optimal strategy for scavenger/gatherer animals inhabiting less-featured landscapes. Animals inhabiting cluttered landscapes, especially predatory ones, however, may need substantial familiarity with foraging landscapes to forage efficiently. They may acquire such spatial familiarity with increasing age/experience, and eventually reduce their foraging effort without compromising on foraging success/efficiency. To check whether this holds for individually-foraging predatory tropical paper-wasp Ropalidia marginata, we recorded the number and duration of all foraging trips, the identity of foraged materials, and the directions of outbound and inbound flights (with respect to the nest) of known-age wasps for three consecutive days from three naturally-occurring colonies – thus, we measured behavioural profiles of wasps of various ages, and not from the same wasp throughout its lifespan. Wasps increased their foraging duration rapidly until about four weeks of age, during which they rarely brought food, although some wasps brought building material and water. Thereafter, their foraging duration started decreasing. Nevertheless, their foraging success/efficiency in bringing food kept on increasing. With age, wasps developed individual directional preferences for outbound and inbound flights, indicating the development of spatial memory for rewarding sites. Also, the angular difference between their outbound and subsequent inbound flights gradually increased, indicating older wasps may have followed tortuous foraging routes. High investment in early-life to acquire familiarity with foraging landscapes and using that later to perform efficient foraging could be an optimal strategy for individually-foraging animals inhabiting feature-rich landscapes."

        "abstract": "Mechanosensation provides animals with important sensory information in addition to olfaction and gustation during feeding behavior. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster larvae to investigate the role of softness sensing in behavior and learning. In the natural environment, larvae need to dig into soft foods for feeding. Finding foods that are soft enough to dig into is likely to be essential for their survival. We report that larvae can discriminate between different agar concentrations and prefer softer agar. Interestingly, we show that larvae on a harder surface search for a softer surface using memory associated with an odor, and that they evaluate foods by balancing softness and sweetness. These findings suggest that larvae integrate mechanosensory information with chemosensory input while foraging. Moreover, we found that the larval preference for softness is affected by genetic background."

        "abstract": "Trout caeca are vermiform structures projecting from the anterior intestine of the gastrointestinal tract. Despite their simple gross morphology, these appendages are physically distinct along the anterior–posterior axis, and ultrastructural evidence suggests zonation of function within the structures. Individual caeca from three sections (anterior, middle and posterior) were removed from the intestine of freshwater rainbow trout and investigated for ion transport and enzyme activity. Ca2+ absorption appeared as a combination of active and passive movement, with Michaelis–Menten kinetics observable under symmetrical conditions, and was inhibited by several pharmacological agents (ouabain, La3+ and a calmodulin antagonist). There was a decrease in ion transport function from adjacent to the intestine (proximal) to the distal tip of each caecum, along with decreasing transport from anterior to posterior for the proximal portion alone. Feeding increased the JMax and KM for Ca2+ absorption within all sections, whereas ion-poor water (IPW) exposure further increased the JMax and KM for Ca2+ transport in the anterior and middle sections. Increased Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and citrate synthase (CS) activity rates paralleled trends seen in Ca2+ transport. Feeding in freshwater and IPW exposure increased the glycolytic capacity of the caeca via increased pyruvate kinase (PK) and decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, while amino acid metabolism increased with IPW exposure through increased glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity. Overall, feeding and IPW exposure each altered ionoregulation within the caeca of freshwater rainbow trout in a zone-specific pattern, with the anterior and proximal portions of the caeca being most affected. Increased carbohydrate and protein metabolism fueled the increased ATP demand of NKA through CS."

        "abstract": "We examined the control of breathing and respiratory gas exchange in six species of high-altitude duck that independently colonized the high Andes. We compared ducks from high-altitude populations in Peru (Lake Titicaca at ∼3800 m above sea level; Chancay River at ∼3000–4100 m) with closely related populations or species from low altitude. Hypoxic ventilatory responses were measured shortly after capture at the native altitude. In general, ducks responded to acute hypoxia with robust increases in total ventilation and pulmonary O2 extraction. O2 consumption rates were maintained or increased slightly in acute hypoxia, despite ∼1–2°C reductions in body temperature in most species. Two high-altitude taxa – yellow-billed pintail and torrent duck – exhibited higher total ventilation than their low-altitude counterparts, and yellow-billed pintail exhibited greater increases in pulmonary O2 extraction in severe hypoxia. In contrast, three other high-altitude taxa – Andean ruddy duck, Andean cinnamon teal and speckled teal – had similar or slightly reduced total ventilation and pulmonary O2 extraction compared with low-altitude relatives. Arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) was elevated in yellow-billed pintails at moderate levels of hypoxia, but there were no differences in SaO2 in other high-altitude taxa compared with their close relatives. This finding suggests that improvements in SaO2 in hypoxia can require increases in both breathing and haemoglobin–O2 affinity, because the yellow-billed pintail was the only high-altitude duck with concurrent increases in both traits compared with its low-altitude relative. Overall, our results suggest that distinct physiological strategies for coping with hypoxia can exist across different high-altitude lineages, even among those inhabiting very similar high-altitude habitats."

        "abstract": "Analysis of some experimental biology data involves linear regression and interpretation of the resulting slope value. Usually, the x-axis measurements include noise. Noise in the x-variable can create regression dilution, and many biologists are not aware of the implications: regression dilution results in an underestimation of the true slope value. This is particularly problematic when the slope value is diagnostic. For example, energy management strategies of animals can be determined from the regression slope estimate of mean energy expenditure against resting energy expenditure. Typically, energy expenditure is represented by a proxy such as heart rate, which adds substantive measurement error. With simulations and analysis of empirical data, we explore the possible effect of regression dilution on interpretations of energy management strategies. We conclude that unless the coefficient of determination r2 is very high, there is a good possibility that regression dilution will affect qualitative interpretation. We recommend some ways to contend with regression dilution, including the application of alternative available regression approaches under certain circumstances."

        "abstract": "Adult holometabolous insects may derive metabolic resources from either larval or adult feeding, but little is known of whether adult diets can compensate for deficiencies in the larval diet in terms of stress resistance. We investigated how stress resistance is affected and compensated for by diet across life stages in the marula fruit fly Ceratitis cosyra (Diptera: Tephritidae). Larvae were fed diets containing either 8% torula yeast, the standard diet used to rear this species, or 1% yeast (low protein content similar to known host fruit). At emergence, adults from each larval diet were tested for initial mass, water content, body composition, and desiccation and starvation resistance or they were allocated to one of two adult diet treatments: sucrose only, or sucrose and yeast hydrolysate. The same assays were then repeated after 10 days of adult feeding. Development on a low protein larval diet led to lower body mass and improved desiccation and starvation resistance in newly emerged adults, even though adults from the high protein larval diet had the highest water content. Adult feeding decreased desiccation or starvation resistance, regardless of the diet provided. Irrespective of larval diet history, newly emerged, unfed adults had significantly higher dehydration tolerance than those that were fed. Lipid reserves played a role in starvation resistance. There was no evidence for metabolic water from stored nutrients extending desiccation resistance. Our findings show the possibility of a nutrient-poor larval environment leading to correlated improvement in adult performance, at least in the short term."

        "abstract": "The red lionfish, Pterois volitans, an invasive species, has 18 venomous spines: 13 dorsal, three anal and one on each pelvic fin. Fish spines can have several purposes, such as defense, intimidation and anchoring into crevices. Instead of being hollow, lionfish spines have a tri-lobed cross-sectional shape with grooves that deliver the venom, tapering towards the tip. We aimed to quantify the impacts of shape (second moment of area) and tapering on the mechanical properties of the spine. We performed two-point bending at several positions along the spines of P. volitans to determine mechanical properties (Young's modulus, elastic energy storage and flexural stiffness). The short and recurved anal and pelvic spines are stiffer and resist bending more effectively than the long dorsal spines. In addition, mechanical properties differ along the length of the spines, most likely because they are tapered. We hypothesize that the highly bendable dorsal spines are used for intimidation, making the fish look larger. The stiffer and energy-absorbing anal and pelvic spines are smaller and less numerous, but they may be used for protection as they are located near important internal structures such as the swim bladder. Lastly, spine second moment of area varies across the Pterois genus. These data suggest there may be morphological and mechanical trade-offs among defense, protection and intimidation for lionfish spines. Overall, the red lionfish venomous spine shape and mechanics may offer protection and intimidate potential predators, significantly contributing to their invasion success."

        "abstract": "Avian eggs contend with omnipresent microorganisms entering the egg interior, where they affect embryo viability and hatchling phenotype. The incubation behaviour and deposition of egg white antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) vary highly across the avian altricial–precocial spectrum. Experimental evidence of how these alterations in avian reproductive strategies affect the antimicrobial properties of the precocial and altricial egg interior is lacking, however. Here, we tested the egg white antimicrobial activity in eggs of two representative model species, from each end of the avian altricial–precocial spectrum, against potentially pathogenic and beneficial probiotic microorganisms. Eggs were experimentally treated to mimic un-incubated eggs in the nest, partial incubation during the egg-laying period, the onset of full incubation and the increased deposition of two main egg white AMPs, lysozyme and ovotransferrin. We moreover assessed to what extent egg antimicrobial components, egg white pH and AMP concentrations varied as a result of different incubation patterns. Fully incubated precocial and altricial eggs decreased their antimicrobial activity against a potentially pathogenic microorganism, whereas partial incubation significantly enhanced the persistence of a beneficial probiotic microorganism in precocial eggs. These effects were most probably conditioned by temperature-dependent alterations in egg white pH and AMP concentrations. While lysozyme concentration and pH decreased in fully incubated precocial but not altricial eggs, egg white ovotransferrin increased along with the intensity of incubation in both precocial and altricial eggs. This study is the first to experimentally demonstrate that different incubation patterns may have selective antimicrobial potential mediated by species-specific effects on antimicrobial components in the egg white."

        "abstract": "Coordination of multiple propulsors can provide performance benefits in swimming organisms. Siphonophores are marine colonial organisms that orchestrate the motion of multiple swimming zooids for effective swimming. However, the kinematics at the level of individual swimming zooids (nectophores) have not been examined in detail. We used high-speed, high-resolution microvideography and particle image velocimetry of the physonect siphonophore Nanomia bijuga to study the motion of the nectophores and the associated fluid motion during jetting and refilling. The integration of nectophore and velum kinematics allow for a high-speed (maximum ∼1 m s−1), narrow (1–2 mm) jet and rapid refill, as well as a 1:1 ratio of jetting to refill time. Scaled to the 3 mm nectophore length, jet speeds reach >300 lengths s−1. Overall swimming performance is enhanced by velocity gradients produced in the nectophore during refill, which lead to a high-pressure region that produces forward thrust. Generating thrust during both the jet and refill phases augments the distance traveled by 17% over theoretical animals, which generate thrust only during the jet phase. The details of velum kinematics and associated fluid mechanics elucidate how siphonophores effectively navigate three-dimensional space, and could be applied to exit flow parameters in multijet underwater vehicles."

        "abstract": "Food processing refers to any form of mechanical breakdown of food prior to swallowing. Variations of this behaviour are found within all major gnathostome groups. Chewing is by far the most commonly used intraoral processing mechanism and involves rhythmic mandibular jaw and hyobranchial (tongue) movements. Chewing occurs in chondrichthyans (sharks and rays), actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes), dipnoi (lungfishes) as well as amniotes and involves similarities in the patterns of muscle activity and movement of the feeding apparatus. It has been suggested that amniote chewing, which involves the interaction of movements of the mandibular jaw and the muscular tongue, has evolved as part of the tetrapod land invasion. However, little is known about food-processing mechanisms in lissamphibians, which might have retained many ancestral tetrapod features. Here, we identified a processing mechanism in the salamandrid newt, Triturus carnifex, which after prey capture displays cyclic head bobbing in concert with rhythmic jaw and tongue movements. We used high-speed fluoroscopy, anatomical reconstructions and analyses of stomach contents to show that newts, although not using their mandibular jaws, deploy a derived processing mechanism where prey items are rasped rhythmically against the dentition on the mouth roof, driven by a loop motion of the tongue. We then compared patterns and coordination of jaw and tongue movements across gnathostomes to conclude that food processing in this newt species shares traits with processing mechanisms in fish as well as amniotes. This discovery casts salamanders as promising models for reconstructing the evolution of intraoral processing mechanisms at the fish–tetrapod split."

        "abstract": "The torpor-assisted migration hypothesis posits that migration is facilitated in bats by the use of torpor during stopover roosting periods, and predicts that at stopover, bats regulate time in torpor facultatively so that daily energy expenditure is independent of ambient roosting temperature. Energy savings can thus be directed to migratory movement. However, direct measurements of total roosting energy expenditure in relation to ambient and body temperature are lacking. We captured migratory silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans; ∼11 g) at Long Point, ON, Canada, in spring and autumn 2016. We used quantitative magnetic resonance analysis to measure body composition change and energy expenditure over a 12 h roosting period in a ventilated incubator at 10, 17 and 25°C. We assessed the effects of season, body mass, sex and age on energy expenditure. We found that daily energy expenditure was independent of roosting temperature, and that this was achieved by flexible use of torpor. Variation in body mass at capture was driven mainly by differences in fat, and the amount of body fat was negatively related to torpor use, particularly in spring. Season, sex and age also affected torpor use and energy expenditure, notably with pregnant females being generally fatter and using less torpor than males in spring. We estimate that stopover contributes only 15–20% to the total energy costs of migration in bats compared with 70% or more in typical birds. This study provides support for the torpor-assisted migration hypothesis, and furthers our understanding of the energy budgets of migratory bats."

        "abstract": "Unusual undulations in resting tension (tonus waves) were described in isolated atria from freshwater turtles more than a century ago. These tonus waves were soon after married with the histological demonstration of a rich layer of smooth muscle on the luminal side of the atrial wall. Research thereafter waned and the functional significance of this smooth muscle has remained obscure. Here, we provide evidence that contraction of the smooth muscle in the atria may be able to change cardiac output in turtle hearts. In in situ perfused hearts of the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans), we demonstrated that activation of smooth muscle contraction with histamine (100 nmol kg−1 bolus injected into perfusate) reduced cardiac output by decreasing stroke volume (>50% decrease in both parameters). Conversely, inhibition of smooth muscle contraction with wortmannin (10 µmol l−1 perfusion) approximately doubled baseline stroke volume and cardiac output. We suggest that atrial smooth muscle provides a unique mechanism to control cardiac filling that could be involved in the regulation of stroke volume during diving."

        "abstract": "Substrate variations are likely to constrain animal performance in natural environments, as running over complex terrains challenges the dynamic stability of the body differently in each step. Yet, being able to negotiate complex terrains at top speed is a strong advantage for animals that have to deal with predators and evasive prey. Little is known on how animals negotiate such terrain variability at high speed. We investigated this in fast-running Acanthodactylus boskianus lizards, by measuring their 3D kinematics using four synchronised high-speed video cameras (325 Hz) on an adaptable racetrack. This racetrack was covered with four different substrates, representing increasing levels of terrain complexity. We found that the lizards deal with this complexity gradient by gradually adopting more erect parasagittal leg postures. Legs in a more-erect position are more compliant and are therefore highly adjustable on complex terrains. Additionally, the lizards stabilise their head, which facilitates vestibular and visual perception. Together, compliant legs and head stabilisation enable the lizards to minimise movements of the body centre of mass, even when running on highly irregular terrains. This suggests that the head and the centre of mass are the priority targets for running on uneven terrains. As a result, running performance (mean forward speed) decreases only slightly, and only on the most challenging substrate under investigation."

        "abstract": "The evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fishes in the isolated freezing Southern Ocean has led to remarkable trait gains and losses. One of the most extraordinary was the loss of the major oxygen carrier hemoglobin (Hb) in the icefishes (family Channichthyidae). Although the mechanisms of this loss and the resulting compensatory changes have been well studied, the impact of Hb loss on the network of genes that once supported its recycling and disposal has remained unexplored. Here, we report the functional fate and underlying molecular changes of two such key Hb-supporting proteins across the icefish family – haptoglobin (Hp) and hemopexin (Hx), crucial in removing cytotoxic free Hb and heme, respectively. Hp plays a critical role in binding free Hb for intracellular recycling and absent its primary client, icefish Hp transcription is now vanishingly little, and translation into a functional protein is nearly silenced. Hp genotype degeneration has manifested in separate lineages of the icefish phylogeny with three distinct nonsense mutations and a deletion frame shift, as well as mutated polyadenylation signal sequences. Thus, Hb loss appears to have diminished selective constraint on Hp maintenance, resulting in its stochastic, co-evolutionary drift towards extinction. Hx binds free heme for iron recycling in hepatocytes. In contrast to Hp, Hx genotype integrity is preserved in the icefishes and transcription occurs at levels comparable to those in the red-blooded notothenioids. The persistence of Hx likely owes to continued selective pressure for its function from mitochondrial and non-Hb cellular hemoproteins."

In total, 91 proteins were identified, of which 61 were extracellular soluble and 16 were bound to the plasma membrane.

A series of candidate proteins involved in early response to injury was revealed. Ependymin, β-microseminoprotein, serum amyloid A and avidin-like proteins, which are known to be involved in intestinal regeneration in the sea cucumber, were also identified as injury-responsive proteins. Our results expand the list of proteins potentially involved in defense and regeneration in echinoderms and demonstrate dramatic effects of injury on the coelomic fluid proteome."

        "abstract": "Characterisation of an organism's performance in different habitats provides insight into the conditions that allow it to survive and reproduce. In recent years, the northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) – a medium-sized semi-arboreal marsupial native to northern Australia – has undergone significant population declines within open forest, woodland and riparian habitats, but less so in rocky areas. To help understand this decline, we quantified the biomechanical performance of wild northern quolls as they ran up inclined narrow (13 mm pole) and inclined wide (90 mm platform) substrates. We predicted that quolls may possess biomechanical adaptations to increase stability on narrow surfaces, which are more common in rocky habitats. Our results showed that quolls have some biomechanical characteristics consistent with a stability advantage on narrow surfaces. This includes the coupled use of limb pairs, as indicated via a decrease in footfall time, and an ability to produce corrective torques to counteract the toppling moments commonly encountered during gait on narrow surfaces. However, speed was constrained on narrow surfaces, and quolls did not adopt diagonal sequence gaits, unlike true arboreal specialists such as primates. In comparison with key predators, such as cats and dogs, northern quolls appear inferior in terrestrial environments but have a stability advantage at higher speeds on narrow supports. This may partially explain the heterogeneous declines in northern quoll populations among various habitats on mainland Australia."

        "abstract": "An effective immune response results in the elimination of pathogens, but this immunological benefit may be accompanied by increased levels of oxidative damage. However, organisms have evolved mechanisms to mitigate the extent of such oxidative damage, including the production and mobilization of antioxidants. One potential mechanism of mitigating immune challenge-induced changes in oxidative physiology is increasing biliverdin production. Biliverdin is chemically an antioxidant, but within-tissue correlations between biliverdin concentration and oxidative damage have never been directly examined. To test how biliverdin tissue concentrations are associated with physiological responses to an immune challenge, we exposed northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) to one of four treatments: injection of a non-pathogenic antigen – either lipopolysaccharide or phytohemagglutinin, control injection of phosphate-buffered saline or a sham procedure with no injection. Twenty-four hours later, we quantified oxidative damage and triglyceride concentration in the plasma, and biliverdin concentration in the plasma, liver and spleen. We found that both types of immune challenge increased oxidative damage relative to both non-injected and vehicle-injected controls, but treatment had no effects on any other metric. However, across all birds, oxidative damage and biliverdin concentration in the plasma were negatively correlated, which is consistent with a localized antioxidant function of biliverdin. Additionally, we uncovered multiple links between biliverdin concentration, change in mass during the immune challenges and triglyceride levels, suggesting that pathways associated with biliverdin production may also be associated with aspects of nutrient mobilization. Future experiments that manipulate biliverdin levels or oxidative damage directly could establish a systemic antioxidant function or elucidate important physiological impacts on body mass maintenance and triglyceride storage, mobilization or transport."

However, under dim light conditions many bats can also rely on vision. Many flying animals have been shown to navigate by optic flow information and, recently, bats were shown to exploit echo-acoustic flow to navigate through dark habitats. Here, we show for the bat Phyllostomus discolor that, in lighted habitats where self-motion-induced optic flow is strong, optic and echo-acoustic flow interact to guide navigation. Echo-acoustic flow showed a surprisingly strong effect compared with optic flow. We thus demonstrate multimodal interaction between two far-ranging spatial senses, vision and echolocation, available in this combination almost exclusively in bats and toothed whales. Our results highlight the importance of merging information from different sensory systems in a sensory-specialist animal to successfully navigate and hunt under difficult conditions."

        "abstract": "Stress exposure during prenatal and postnatal development can have persistent and often dysfunctional effects on several physiological systems, including immune function, affecting the ability to combat infection. The neuroimmune response is inextricably linked to the action of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Cytokines released from neuroimmune cells, including microglia, activate the HPA axis, while glucocorticoids in turn regulate cytokine release from microglia. Because of the close links between these two physiological systems, coupled with potential for persistent changes to HPA axis activity following developmental stress, components of the neuroimmune system could be targets for developmental programming. However, little is known of any programming effects of developmental stress on neuroimmune function. We investigated whether developmental stress exposure via elevated prenatal corticosterone (CORT) or postnatal unpredictable food availability had long-term effects on pro- (IL-1β) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokine and microglia-dependent gene (CSF1R) expression within HPA axis tissues in a precocial bird, the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Following postnatal stress, we observed increased IL-1β expression in the pituitary gland, reduced IL-10 expression in the amygdala and hypothalamus, and reduced CSF1R expression within the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Postnatal stress disrupted the ratio of IL-1β:IL-10 expression within the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Prenatal stress only increased IL-1β expression in the pituitary gland. We found no evidence for interactive or cumulative effects across life stages on basal cytokine and glia expression in adulthood. We show that postnatal stress may have a larger impact than elevated prenatal CORT on basal immunity in HPA-axis-specific brain regions, with changes in cytokine homeostasis and microglia abundance. These results provide evidence for postnatal programming of a pro-inflammatory neuroimmune phenotype at the expense of reduced microglia, which could have implications for central nervous system health and subsequent neuroimmune responses."

The main purpose of this experiment was to compare dynamic measures of fatigue [maximal torque (Tmax), maximal velocity (Vmax) and maximal power (Pmax)] with measures associated with maximal isometric force [isometric maximal voluntary contraction (IMVC) and maximal rate of force development (MRFD)] 10 s after different fatiguing exercises and during the recovery period (1-8 min after). Ten young men completed 6 experimental sessions (3 fatiguing exercises×2 types of fatigue measurements). The fatiguing exercises were: a 30-s all out (WING), 10-min at severe-intensity (SEV) and 90-min at moderate-intensity (MOD). Relative Pmax decreased more than IMVC after WING (p=0.005) while the opposite was found after SEV (p=0.005) and MOD tasks (p<0.001). There was no difference between the decrease in IMVC and Tmax after the WING, but IMVC decreased more than Tmax immediately following and during the recovery from the SEV (p=0.042) and MOD exercises (p<0.001). Depression of MRFD was greater than Vmax after all the fatiguing exercises and during recovery (all p<0.05). Despite the general definition of fatigue, isometric assessment of fatigue is not interchangeable with dynamic assessment following dynamic exercises with large muscle mass of different intensities, i.e. the results from isometric function cannot be used to estimate dynamic function and vice-versa. This implies different physiological mechanisms for the various measures of fatigue."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/6/jeb197301",
        "abstract": "Many animals fight over a limited valuable resource. In marmorkrebs (marbled crayfish), large animals usually defeat small opponents but they are frequently beaten by small opponents that are shelter owners. A prior residence effect of marbled crayfish was analysed quantitatively in the present study. More than 2 h of residency in a shelter was sufficient for small owners to defeat large intruders. Small animals that stayed in a shelter for 24 h still tended to win following removal of the shelter 10 min before pairing with large intruders, but 2 h residents were occasionally beaten by large intruders without the support of shelters during pairings. The prior residence effect thus developed depending on the duration of residency. To clarify whether the strength of the prior residence effect was affected by the quality of a shelter, large and small owners with different combinations of high- and low-quality shelters were paired. When both large and small owners possessed a high-quality shelter, the frequency of agonistic bouts was reduced. Even if agonistic bouts occurred, the win frequency of small owners was almost equal to that of large owners. Thus, the residence effect on small owners was sufficiently strong to overcome the physical disadvantage of small animals to large opponents. By contrast, small owners of low­-quality shelters were frequently beaten by large owners with the shelters of same or better quality. We conclude that the outcome of fights over the resource shelter is highly dependent on both the perception of shelter quality and body size differences."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/6/jeb194480",
        "abstract": "Processing food (e.g. ingestion, digestion, assimilation) requires energy referred to as specific dynamic action (SDA) and is at least partially fuelled by oxidation of the nutrients (e.g. proteins and lipids) within the recently ingested meal. In ectotherms, environmental temperature can affect the magnitude and/or duration of the SDA, but is likely to also alter the mixture of nutrients that are oxidized to cover these costs. Here, we examined metabolic rate, gut passage time, assimilation efficiency and fuel use in the lizard Agama atra digesting cricket meals at three ecologically relevant temperatures (20, 25 and 32°C). Crickets were isotopically enriched with 13C-leucine or 13C-palmitic-acid tracers to distinguish between protein and lipid oxidation, respectively. Our results show that higher temperatures increased the magnitude of the SDA peak (by 318% between 32 and 20°C) and gut passage rate (63%), and decreased the duration of the SDA response (by 20% for males and 48% for females). Peak rate of dietary protein oxidation occurred sooner than peak lipid oxidation at all temperatures (70, 60 and 31 h earlier for 20, 25 and 32°C, respectively). Assimilation efficiency of proteins, but not lipids, was positively related to temperature. Interestingly, the SDA response exhibited a notable circadian rhythm. These results show that temperature has a pronounced effect on digestive energetics in A. atra, and that this effect differs between nutrient classes. Variation in environmental temperatures may thus alter the energy budget and nutrient reserves of these animals."

        "abstract": "An adaptive visual system is essential for organisms inhabiting new or changing light environments. The Panama Canal exhibits such variable environments owing to its anthropogenic origin and current human activities. Within the Panama Canal, Lake Gatun harbors several exotic fish species including the invasive peacock bass (Cichla monoculus), a predatory Amazonian cichlid. In this research, through spectral measurements and molecular and physiological experiments, we studied the visual system of C. monoculus and its adaptive capabilities. Our results suggest that (1) Lake Gatun is a highly variable environment, where light transmission changes throughout the canal waterway, and that (2) C. monoculus has several visual adaptations suited for this red-shifted light environment. Cichla monoculus filters short wavelengths (∼400 nm) from the environment through its ocular media and tunes its visual sensitivities to the available light through opsin gene expression. More importantly, based on shifts in spectral sensitivities of photoreceptors alone, and on transcriptome analysis, C. monoculus exhibits extreme intraspecific variation in the use of vitamin A1/A2 chromophore in their photoreceptors. Fish living in turbid water had higher proportions of vitamin A2, shifting sensitivities to longer wavelengths, than fish living in clear water. Furthermore, we also found variation in retinal transcriptomes, where fish from turbid and clear waters exhibited differentially expressed genes that vary greatly in their function. We suggest that this phenotypic plasticity has been key in the invasion success of C. monoculus."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/6/jeb188102",
        "abstract": "Carotenoid-based coloration in birds is widely considered an honest signal of individual condition, but the mechanisms responsible for condition dependency in such ornaments remain debated. Currently, the most common explanation for how carotenoid coloration serves as a reliable signal of condition is the resource trade-off hypothesis, which proposes that use of carotenoids for ornaments reduces their availability for use by the immune system or for protection from oxidative damage. However, two main assumptions of the hypothesis remain in question: whether carotenoids boost the performance of internal processes such as immune and antioxidant defenses, and whether allocating carotenoids to ornaments imposes a trade-off with such benefits. In this study, we tested these two fundamental assumptions using types of domestic canary (Serinus canaria domestica) that enable experiments in which carotenoid availability and allocation can be tightly controlled. Specifically, we assessed metrics of immune and antioxidant performance in three genetic variants of the color-bred canary that differ only in carotenoid phenotype: ornamented, carotenoid-rich yellow canaries; unornamented, carotenoid-rich ‘white dominant’ canaries; and unornamented, carotenoid-deficient ‘white recessive’ canaries. The resource trade-off hypothesis predicts that carotenoid-rich individuals should outperform carotenoid-deficient individuals and that birds that allocate carotenoids to feathers should pay a cost in the form of reduced immune function or greater oxidative stress compared with unornamented birds. We found no evidence to support either prediction; all three canary types performed equally across measures. We suggest that testing alternative mechanisms for the honesty of carotenoid-based coloration should be a key focus of future studies of carotenoid-based signaling in birds."

        "abstract": "Exposure to anoxia leads to rapid ATP depletion, alters metabolic pathways and exacerbates succinate accumulation. Upon re-oxygenation, the preferential oxidation of accumulated succinate most often impairs mitochondrial function. Few species can survive prolonged periods of hypoxia and anoxia at tropical temperatures and those that do may rely on mitochondria plasticity in response to disruptions to oxygen availability. Two carpet sharks, the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) and the grey carpet shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) display different adaptive responses to prolonged anoxia: while H. ocellatum enters energy-conserving metabolic depression, C. punctatum temporarily elevates its haematocrit, prolonging oxygen delivery. High-resolution respirometry was used to investigate mitochondrial function in the cerebellum, a highly metabolically active organ that is oxygen sensitive and vulnerable to injury after anoxia/re-oxygenation (AR). Succinate was titrated into cerebellar preparations in vitro, with or without pre-exposure to AR, then the activity of mitochondrial complexes was examined. As in most vertebrates, C. punctatum mitochondria significantly increased succinate oxidation rates, with impaired complex I function post-AR. In contrast, H. ocellatum mitochondria inhibited succinate oxidation rates and both complex I and II capacities were conserved, resulting in preservation of oxidative phosphorylation capacity post-AR. Divergent mitochondrial plasticity elicited by elevated succinate post-AR parallels the inherently divergent physiological adaptations of these animals to prolonged anoxia, namely the absence (C. punctatum) and presence (H. ocellatum) of metabolic depression. As anoxia tolerance in these species also occurs at temperatures close to that for humans, examining their mitochondrial responses to AR could provide insights for novel interventions in clinical settings."

        "abstract": "A lower duty factor (DF) reflects a greater relative contribution of leg swing versus ground contact time during the running step. Increasing time on the ground has been reported in the scientific literature to both increase and decrease the energy cost (EC) of running, with DF reported to be highly variable in runners. As increasing running speed aligns running kinematics more closely with spring–mass model behaviours and re-use of elastic energy, we compared the centre of mass (COM) displacement and EC between runners with a low (DFlow) and high (DFhigh) duty factor at typical endurance running speeds. Forty well-trained runners were divided in two groups based on their mean DF measured across a range of speeds. EC was measured from 4 min treadmill runs at 10, 12 and 14 km h−1 using indirect calorimetry. Temporal characteristics and COM displacement data of the running step were recorded from 30 s treadmill runs at 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 km h−1. Across speeds, DFlow exhibited more symmetrical patterns between braking and propulsion phases in terms of time and vertical COM displacement than DFhigh. DFhigh limited global vertical COM displacements in favour of horizontal progression during ground contact. Despite these running kinematics differences, no significant difference in EC was observed between groups. Therefore, both DF strategies seem energetically efficient at endurance running speeds."

        "abstract": "Theoretical modelling predicts that the thermoregulatory strategies of endothermic animals range from those represented by thermal generalists to those characteristic for thermal specialists. While the generalists tolerate wide variations in body temperature (Tb), the specialists maintain Tb at a more constant level. The model has gained support from inter-specific comparisons relating to species and population levels. However, little is known about consistent among-individual variation within populations that could be shaped by natural selection. We studied the consistency of individual heterothermic responses to environmental challenges in a single population of yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis), by verifying the hypothesis that Tb variation is a repeatable trait. To induce the heterothermic response, the same individuals were repeatedly food deprived for 24 h. We measured Tb with implanted miniaturised data loggers. Before each fasting experiment, we measured basal metabolic rate (BMR). Thus, we also tested whether individual variation of heterothermy correlates with individual self-maintenance costs, and the potential benefits arising from heterothermic responses that should correlate with body size/mass. We found that some individuals clearly entered torpor while others kept Tb stable, and that there were also individuals that showed intermediate thermoregulatory patterns. Heterothermy was found to correlate negatively with body mass and slightly positively with the BMR achieved 1–2 days before fasting. Nonetheless, heterothermy was shown to be highly repeatable, irrespective of whether we controlled for self-maintenance costs and body size. Our results indicate that specialist and generalist thermoregulatory phenotypes can co-exist in a single population, creating a heterothermy continuum."

There was considerable variation in the end-expired O2, VT and fR following a breath-hold. The analysis suggests that the dolphins attempt to minimize recovery following a dive by altering VT and fR to rapidly replenish the O2 stores. For the first breath following a surface breath-hold, the end-expired O2 decreased with dive duration, while VT and fR increased. Throughout the recovery period, end-expired O2 increased while the respiratory effort (VT, fR) decreased. We propose that the dolphins alter respiratory effort following a breath-hold according to the reduction in end-expired O2 levels, allowing almost complete recovery after 1.2 min."

        "abstract": "Orthostatic hypotension is a phenomenon triggered by a change in the position or posture of an animal, from a horizontal to a vertical head-up orientation, characterised by a blood pooling in the lower body and a reduction in central and cranial arterial blood pressure (PA). This hypotension elicits systemic vasoconstriction and tachycardia, which generally reduce blood pooling and increase PA. Little is known about the mediation and importance of such cardiovascular adjustments that counteract the haemodynamic effects of orthostasis in ectothermic vertebrates, and some discrepancies exist in the information available on this subject. Thus, we sought to expand our knowledge on this issue by investigating it in a more elaborate way, through an in vivo pharmacological approach considering temporal circulatory changes during head-up body inclinations in unanaesthetised Boa constrictor. To do so, we analysed temporal changes in PA, heart rate (fH) and cardiac autonomic tone associated with 30 and 60 deg inclinations, before and after muscarinic blockade with atropine, double blockade with atropine and propranolol, and α1-adrenergic receptor blockade with prazosin. Additionally, the animals' fH variability was analysed. The results revealed that, in B. constrictor: (1) the orthostatic tachycardia is initially mediated by a decrease in cholinergic tone followed by an increase in adrenergic tone, a pattern that may be evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates; (2) the orthostatic tachycardia is important for avoiding an intense decrease in PA at the beginning of body inclinations; and (3) α1-adrenergic orthostatic vasomotor responses are important for the maintenance of PA at satisfactory values during long-term inclinations."

Here, we exemplify the utility of a method quantifying individual mRNA transcripts in revealing the molecular basis of divergence in feather pigment synthesis during early-stage speciation in crows. Using a padlock probe assay combined with rolling circle amplification, we quantified cell-type-specific gene expression in the histological context of growing feather follicles. Expression of Tyrosinase Related Protein 1 (TYRP1), Solute Carrier Family 45 member 2 (SLC45A2) and Hematopoietic Prostaglandin D Synthase (HPGDS) was melanocyte-limited and significantly reduced in follicles from hooded crow, explaining the substantially lower eumelanin content in grey versus black feathers. The central upstream Melanocyte Inducing Transcription Factor (MITF) only showed differential expression specific to melanocytes – a feature not captured by bulk RNA-seq. Overall, this study provides insight into the molecular basis of an evolutionary young transition in pigment synthesis, and demonstrates the power of histologically explicit, statistically substantiated single-cell gene expression quantification for functional genetic inference in natural populations."

        "abstract": "When exposed to anoxia, insects rapidly go into a hypometabolic coma from which they can recover when exposed to normoxia again. However, prolonged anoxic bouts eventually lead to death in most insects, although some species are surprisingly tolerant. Anoxia challenges ATP, ion, pH and water homeostasis, but it is not clear how fast and to what degree each of these parameters is disrupted during anoxia, nor how quickly they recover. Further, it has not been investigated which disruptions are the primary source of the tissue damage that ultimately causes death. Here, we show, in the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), that prolonged anoxic exposures are associated with increased recovery time, decreased survival, rapidly disrupted ATP and pH homeostasis and a slower disruption of ion ([K+] and [Na+]) and water balance. Locusts could not fully recover after 4 h of anoxia at 30°C, and at this point hemolymph [K+] was elevated 5-fold and [Na+] was decreased 2-fold, muscle [ATP] was decreased to ≤3% of normoxic values, hemolymph pH had dropped 0.8 units from 7.3 to 6.5, and hemolymph water content was halved. These physiological changes are associated with marked tissue damage in vivo and we show that the isolated and combined effects of hyperkalemia, acidosis and anoxia can all cause muscle tissue damage in vitro to equally large degrees. When locusts were returned to normoxia after a moderate (2 h) exposure of anoxia, ATP recovered rapidly (15 min) and this was quickly followed by recovery of ion balance (30 min), while pH recovery took 2–24 h. Recovery of [K+] and [Na+] coincided with the animals exiting the comatose state, but recovery to an upright position took ∼90 min and was not related to any of the physiological parameters examined."

        "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is an important aspect of an organism's response to environmental change that often requires the modulation of gene expression. These changes in gene expression can be quantitative, as a result of increases or decreases in the amounts of specific transcripts, or qualitative, as a result of the expression of alternative transcripts from the same gene (e.g. via alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs). Although the role of quantitative changes in gene expression in phenotypic plasticity is well known, relatively few studies have examined the role of qualitative changes. Here, we use skeletal muscle RNA-seq data from Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate the extent of qualitative changes in gene expression in response to cold acclimation. Fewer genes demonstrated alternative splicing than differential expression as a result of cold acclimation; however, differences in splicing were detected for 426 to 866 genes depending on species, indicating that large numbers of qualitative changes in gene expression are associated with cold acclimation. Many of these alternatively spliced genes were also differentially expressed, and there was functional enrichment for involvement in muscle contraction among the genes demonstrating qualitative changes in response to cold acclimation. Additionally, there was a common group of 29 genes with cold-acclimation-mediated changes in splicing in all three species, suggesting that there may be a set of genes with expression patterns that respond qualitatively to prolonged exposure to cold temperatures across fishes."

Astrangia poculata is a temperate scleractinian coral that provides unique opportunities to understand the roles of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation in coral physiological tolerance limits. This species inhabits hard-bottom ecosystems from the northwestern Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico and withstands an annual temperature range of up to 20°C. Additionally, A. poculata is facultatively symbiotic and co-occurs in both symbiotic (‘brown’) and aposymbiotic (‘white’) states. Here, brown and white A. poculata were collected from Virginia (VA) and Rhode Island (RI), USA, and exposed to heat (18–32°C) and cold (18–6°C) stress, during which respiration of the coral host along with photosynthesis and photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of Breviolum psygmophilum photosymbionts were measured. Thermal performance curves (TPCs) of respiration revealed a pattern of countergradient variation with RI corals exhibiting higher respiration rates overall, and specifically at 6, 15, 18, 22 and 26°C. Additionally, thermal optimum (Topt) analyses show a 3.8°C (brown) and 6.9°C (white) higher Topt in the VA population, corresponding to the warmer in situ thermal environment in VA. In contrast to respiration, no origin effect was detected in photosynthesis rates or Fv/Fm, suggesting a possible host-only signature of adaptation. This study is the first to consider A. poculata’s response to both heat and cold stress across symbiotic states and geography, and provides insight into the potential evolutionary mechanisms behind the success of this species along the East Coast of the USA."

        "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate how external mechanical work done during maximal acceleration sprint running changes with increasing running velocity and is associated with running performance. In twelve young males, work done at each step over 50 m from the start was calculated from mechanical energy changes in horizontal anterior–posterior and vertical directions and was divided into braking (−Wkap and −Wv, respectively) and propulsive (+Wkap and +Wv, respectively) phases. The maximal running velocity (Vmax) appeared at 35.87±7.76 m and the time required to run 50 m (T50 m) was 7.11±0.54 s. At 80% Vmax or higher, +Wkap largely decreased and −Wkap abruptly increased. The change in the difference between +Wkap and |−Wkap| (ΔWkap) at every step was relatively small at 70% Vmax or lower. Total work done over 50 m was 82.4±7.5 J kg−1 for +Wkap, 36.2±4.4 J kg−1 for |−Wkap|, 14.3±1.9 J kg−1 for +Wv, and 10.4±1.2 J kg−1 for |−Wv|. The total ΔWkap over 50 m was more strongly correlated with T50 m (r=−0.946, P<0.0001) than the corresponding associations for the other work variables. These results indicate that in maximal sprint running over 50 m, work done during the propulsive phase in the horizontal anterior–posterior direction accounts for the majority of the total external work done during the acceleration stage, and maximizing it while suppressing work done during the braking phase is essential to achieve a high running performance."

Here, we investigated their potential role during the diving phase of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). To this effect, the whole vertebral retia mirabilia of a series of dolphins were removed during post-mortem analysis and examined to assess vessel diameters, and estimate vascular volume and flow rate. We formulated a new hemodynamic model to help clarify vascular dynamics throughout the diving phase, based on the total blood volume of a bottlenose dolphin, and using data available about the perfusion of the main organs and body systems. We computed the minimum blood perfusion necessary to the internal organs, and the stroke volume and cardiac output during the surface state. We then simulated breath-holding conditions and perfusion of the internal organs under the diving-induced bradycardia and reduction of stroke volume and cardiac output, using 10 beats min−1 as the limit for the heart rate for an extended dive of over 3 min. Within these simulated conditions, the retia mirabilia play a vital role as reservoirs of oxygenated blood that permit functional performances and survival of the heart and brain. Our theoretical model, based on the actual blood capacity of the retia mirabilia and available data on organ perfusion, considers the dynamic trend of vasoconstriction during the diving phase and may represent a baseline for future studies on the diving physiology of dolphins and especially for the blood supply to their brain."

Many marine animals exhibit behavioral flexibility when feeding to deal with spatial and temporal heterogeneity in prey resources. However, little is known about flexibility in the feeding behavior of many large marine predators. Here, we documented the feeding behavior and kinematics of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi, n=7) through controlled feeding trials. Seals were fed multiple prey types (e.g. night smelt, capelin, squid and herring) that varied in size and shape to examine behavioral flexibility in feeding. Hawaiian monk seals primarily used suction feeding (91% of all feeding trials) across all prey types, but biting, specifically pierce feeding, was also observed (9% of all feeding trials). Suction feeding was characterized by shorter temporal events, a smaller maximum gape and gape angle, and a fewer number of jaw motions than pierce feeding; suction feeding kinematic performance was also more variable compared with pierce feeding. Seals showed behavioral flexibility in their use of the two strategies. Suction feeding was used most frequently when targeting small to medium sized prey and biting was used with increasing frequency on larger prey. The feeding kinematics differed between feeding strategies and prey types, showing that Hawaiian monk seals adjusted their behaviors to particular feeding contexts. Hawaiian monk seals are opportunistic marine predators and their ability to adapt their feeding strategy and behavior to specific foraging scenarios allows them to target diverse prey resources."

High-resolution movement and passive acoustic data were obtained from non-invasive archival tags (n=42) whereas surface positions were obtained with visual focal follows. Controlled exposure experiments (CEEs) were used to obtain direct behavioral measurements before, during and after simulated and operational military mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS), pseudorandom noise (PRN) and controls (no noise exposure). For a subset of deep-feeding animals (n=21), active acoustic measurements of prey were obtained and used as contextual covariates in response analyses. To investigate potential behavioral changes within individuals as a function of controlled noise exposure conditions, two parallel analyses of time-series data for selected behavioral parameters (e.g. diving, horizontal movement and feeding) were conducted. This included expert scoring of responses according to a specified behavioral severity rating paradigm and quantitative change-point analyses using Mahalanobis distance statistics. Both methods identified clear changes in some conditions. More than 50% of blue whales in deep-feeding states responded during CEEs, whereas no changes in behavior were identified in shallow-feeding blue whales. Overall, responses were generally brief, of low to moderate severity, and highly dependent on exposure context such as behavioral state, source-to-whale horizontal range and prey availability. Response probability did not follow a simple exposure–response model based on received exposure level. These results, in combination with additional analytical methods to investigate different aspects of potential responses within and among individuals, provide a comprehensive evaluation of how free-ranging blue whales responded to mid-frequency military sonar."

        "abstract": "Migration poses many physiological challenges for birds, including sustaining high intensity aerobic exercise for hours or days. A consequence of endurance flight is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS production may be influenced by dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which, although prone to oxidative damage, may limit mitochondrial ROS production and increase antioxidant capacity. We examined how flight muscles manage oxidative stress during flight, and whether dietary long-chain PUFA influence ROS management or damage. Yellow-rumped warblers were fed diets low in PUFA, or high in long-chain n-3 or n-6 PUFA. Flight muscle was sampled from birds in each diet treatment at rest or immediately after flying for up to a maximum of 360 min in a wind tunnel. Flight increased flight muscle superoxide dismutase activity but had no effect on catalase activity. The ratio of glutathione to glutathione disulphide decreased during flight. Oxidative protein damage, indicated by protein carbonyls, increased with flight duration (Pearson r=0.4). Further examination of just individuals that flew for 360 min (N=15) indicates that oxidative damage was related more to total energy expenditure (Pearson r=0.86) than to flight duration itself. This suggests that high quality individuals with higher flight efficiency have not only lower energy costs but also potentially less oxidative damage to repair after arrival at the destination. No significant effects of dietary long-chain PUFA were observed on antioxidants or damage. Overall, flight results in oxidative stress and the degree of damage is likely driven more by energy costs than fatty acid nutrition."

We measured F1 body mass, reproduction, and plasma levels of androgens and corticosterone. F1 group housing led to an increase in body mass. In addition, F1 group housing had a positive effect on mass in daughters of pair-housed P0 females only, which were heaviest under mismatched conditions. At the time of egg collection for the F2 generation, F1 group-housed females were heavier, irrespective of the P0 treatment. F1 females in groups laid heavier eggs, with higher hatching success, and produced heavier offspring, most likely a maternal effect of F1 mass. F1 plasma hormones were affected by neither the P0 nor the F1 social environment. These results contrasted with effects in the P0 generation (reported previously), in which plasma hormone levels, but not mass, differed between social environments. This may be due to changes in adult sex ratios as P0 females were housed with males, whereas F1 females encountered males only during mating. Our study demonstrates potentially relevant mismatch effects of the social environment on F1 body mass and maternal effects on F2 offspring, but further study is needed to understand their adaptive significance and physiological mechanisms."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/5/jeb194019",
        "abstract": "Maintenance of a social group requires the ability to reach consensus when faced with divisive choices. Thus, when migrating colonies of the ant Temnothorax rugatulus split among multiple sites, they can later reunify on the basis of queen location or differences in site quality. In this study, we found that colonies can reunify even without obvious cues to break the symmetry between sites. To learn how they do so, we observed both symmetric reunifications (between identical nests) and asymmetric reunifications (between nests of unequal quality) by colonies of individually marked ants. Both reunification types were accomplished by a tiny minority that carried nestmates from the ‘losing’ to the ‘winning’ site. Reunification effort was highly skewed in asymmetric splits, where the majority of the work was done by the first ant to transport, which nearly always came from the winning site. This contrasted with symmetric splits, where the initiator did not play an outsize role and was just as likely to come from the losing site. Symmetric reunifications were also characterized by high transporter attrition, which may help to prevent deadlocks. Tandem runs were abundant in both types and were typically led by transporters as they returned to the losing site to fetch another nestmate. Few tandem followers joined the transport effort, suggesting that tandem runs do not serve to recruit transporters but may have another, as yet unidentified role. Our results underscore the potentially large contribution of highly active individuals to group behaviour, even in decentralized societies such as ant colonies."

        "abstract": "It has been shown that gut microbes are very important for the behavior and development of Drosophila, as the beneficial microbes are involved in the identification of suitable feeding and egg-laying locations. However, in what way these associated gut microbes influence the fitness-related behaviors of Drosophila melanogaster remains unclear. Here, we show that D. melanogaster exhibits different behavioral preferences towards gut microbes. Both adults and larvae were attracted by the volatile compounds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactobacillus plantarum, but were repelled by Acetobacter malorum in behavioral assays, indicating that an olfactory mechanism is involved in these preference behaviors. While the attraction to yeast was governed by olfactory sensory neurons expressing the odorant co-receptor Orco, the observed behaviors towards the other microbes were retained in flies lacking this co-receptor. By experimentally manipulating the microbiota of the flies, we found that flies did not strive for a diverse microbiome by increasing their preference towards gut microbes that they had not experienced previously. Instead, in some cases, the flies even increased preference for the microbes on which they were reared. Furthermore, exposing Drosophila larvae to all three microbes promoted Drosophila development, while exposure to only S. cerevisiae and A. malorum resulted in the development of larger ovaries and in increased egg numbers in an oviposition assay. Thus, our study provides a better understanding of how gut microbes affect insect behavior and development, and offers an ecological rationale for preferences of flies for different microbes in their natural environment."

        "abstract": "Electrical excitability (EE) is vital for cardiac function and strongly modulated by temperature and external K+ concentration ([K+]o), as formulated in the hypothesis of temperature-dependent deterioration of electrical excitability (TDEE). As little is known about EE of arctic stenothermic fishes, we tested the TDEE hypothesis on ventricular myocytes of polar cod (Boreogadus saida) and navaga (Eleginus nawaga) of the Arctic Ocean and those of temperate freshwater burbot (Lota lota). Ventricular action potentials (APs) were elicited in current-clamp experiments at 3, 9 and 15°C, and AP characteristics and the current needed to elicit APs were examined. At 3°C, ventricular APs of polar cod and navaga were similar but differed from those of burbot in having a lower rate of AP upstroke and a higher rate of repolarization. EE of ventricular myocytes – defined as the ease with which all-or-none APs are triggered – was little affected by acute temperature changes between 3 and 15°C in any species. However, AP duration (APD50) was drastically reduced at higher temperatures. Elevation of [K+]o from 3 to 5.4 mmol l−1 and further to 8 mmol l−1 at 3, 9 and 15°C strongly affected EE and AP characteristics in polar cod and navaga, but had a lesser effect in burbot. In all species, ventricular excitation was resistant to acute temperature elevations, while small increases in [K+]o severely compromised EE, in particular in the marine stenotherms. This suggests that EE of the heart in these Gadiformes species is resistant against acute warming, but less so against the simultaneous temperature and exercise stresses."

        "abstract": "The ability of an animal to run fast has important consequences on its survival capacity and overall fitness. Previous studies have documented how variation in the morphology of the limbs is related to variation in locomotor performance. Although these studies have suggested direct relations between sprint speed and hindlimb morphology, few quantitative data exist. Consequently, it remains unclear whether selection acts in limb segment lengths, overall muscle mass or muscle architecture (e.g. muscle fiber length and cross-sectional area). Here, we investigate whether muscle architecture (mass, fiber length and physiological cross-sectional area), hindlimb segment dimensions, or both, explain variation in sprint speed across 14 species of Anolis lizards. Moreover, we test whether similar relationships exist between morphology and performance for both sexes, which may not be the case given the known differences in locomotor behavior and habitat use. Our results show that the main driver of sprint speed is the variation in femur length for both males and females. Our results further show sexual dimorphism in the traits studied and, moreover, show differences in the traits that predict maximal sprint speed in males and females. For example, snout vent length and overall muscle mass are also good predictors of sprint speed in males, whereas no relationships between muscle mass and sprint speed was observed in females. Only a few significant relationships were found between muscle architecture (fiber length, cross-sectional area) and sprint speed in male anoles, suggesting that overall muscles size, rather than muscle architecture, appears to be under selection."

        "abstract": "Oxygen consumption rates were measured for coral reef fishes during swimming in a bidirectional, oscillatory pattern to simulate station-holding in wave-induced, shallow-water flows. For all species examined, increases in wave intensity, as simulated by increases in frequency and amplitude of oscillation, yielded increased metabolic rates and net costs of swimming (NCOS; swimming metabolic rate minus standard metabolic rate). Comparing species with different swimming modes, the caudal fin swimming Kuhlia spp. (Kuhliidae) and simultaneous pectoral–caudal fin swimming Amphiprion ocellaris (Pomacentridae) turned around to face the direction of swimming most of the time, whereas the median–paired fin (MPF) swimmers, the pectoral fin swimming Ctenochaetus strigosus (Acanthuridae) and dorsal–anal fin swimming Sufflamen bursa (Balistidae), more frequently swam in reverse for one half of the oscillation to avoid turning. Contrary to expectations, the body–caudal fin (BCF) swimming Kuhlia spp. had the lowest overall NCOS in the oscillatory swimming regime compared with the MPF swimmers. However, when examining the effect of increasing frequency of oscillation at similar average velocities, Kuhlia spp. showed a 24% increase in NCOS with a 50% increase in direction changes and accelerations. The two strict MPF swimmers had lower increases on average, suggestive of reduced added costs with increasing frequency of direction changes with this swimming mode. Further studies are needed on the costs of unsteady swimming to determine whether these differences can explain the observed prevalence of fishes using the MPF pectoral fin swimming mode in reef habitats exposed to high, wave-surge-induced water flows."

        "abstract": "White-spotted bamboo sharks, Chiloscyllium plagiosum, generate strong suction-feeding pressures that rival the highest levels measured in ray-finned fishes. However, the hyostylic jaw suspension of these sharks is fundamentally different from the actinopterygian mechanism, including more mobile hyomandibulae, with the jaws and ceratohyal suspended from the hyomandibulae. Prior studies have proposed skeletal kinematics during feeding in orectolobid sharks from indirect measurements. Here, we tested these hypotheses using XROMM to measure cartilage motions directly. In agreement with prior hypotheses, we found extremely large retraction and depression of the ceratohyal, facilitated by large protraction and depression of the hyomandibula. Somewhat unexpectedly, XROMM also showed tremendous long-axis rotation (LAR) of both the ceratohyal and hyomandibula. This LAR likely increases the range of motion for the hyoid arch by keeping the elements properly articulated through their large arcs of motion. XROMM also confirmed that upper jaw protraction occurs before peak gape, similarly to actinopterygian suction feeders, but different from most other sharks in which jaw protrusion serves primarily to close the mouth. Early jaw protraction results from decoupling the rotations of the hyomandibula, with much of protraction occurring before peak gape with the other rotations lagging behind. In addition, the magnitudes of retraction and protraction of the hyoid elements are independent of the magnitude of depression, varying the shape of the mouth among feeding strikes. Hence, the large variation in suction-feeding behavior and performance may contribute to the wide dietary breadth of bamboo sharks."

        "abstract": "The most broadly expressed and studied aspect of sensory transduction is receptor tuning to the power spectral density of the incoming signals. Temporal cues expressed in the phase spectrum are relevant in African and American pulse-emitting electric fish showing electroreceptors sensing the signals carried by the self- and conspecific-generated electric organ discharges. This article concerns the role of electroreceptor phase sensitivity in American pulse Gymnotiformes. These fish show electroreceptors sharply tuned to narrow frequency bands. This led to the common thought that most electrosensory information is contained in the amplitude spectra of the signals. However, behavioral and modeling studies suggest that in their pulses, Gymnotiformes electroreceptors also encode cues embodied in the phase spectrum of natural stimuli. Here, we show that the two main types of tuberous primary afferents of Gymnotus omarorum differentially respond to cues embodied in the amplitude and phase spectra of self-generated electrosensory signals. One afferent type, pulse markers, is mainly driven by the amplitude spectrum, while the other, burst coders, is predominantly sensitive to the phase spectrum. This dual encoding strategy allows the fish to create a sensory manifold where patterns of ‘electric color’ generated by object impedance and other potential sources of ‘colored’ images (such as large nearby objects and other electric fish) can be represented."

        "abstract": "Under nutritional deprivation, the energetic benefits of reducing mitochondrial metabolism are often associated with enhanced harmful pro-oxidant effects and a subsequent long-term negative impact on cellular integrity. However, the flexibility of mitochondrial functioning under stress has rarely been explored during the transition from basal non-phosphorylating to maximal phosphorylating oxygen consumption. Here, we experimentally tested whether ducklings (Cairina moschata), fasted for 6 days and subsequently refed for 3 days, exhibited modifications to their mitochondrial fluxes, i.e. oxygen consumption, ATP synthesis, reactive oxygen species generation (ROS) and associated ratios, such as the electron leak (% ROS/O) and the oxidative cost of ATP production (% ROS/ATP). This was carried out at different steady-state rates of oxidative phosphorylation in both pectoralis (glycolytic) and gastrocnemius (oxidative) muscles. Fasting induced a decrease in the rates of oxidative phosphorylation and maximal ROS release. These changes were completely reversed by 3 days of refeeding. Yet, the fundamental finding of the present study was the existence of a clear threshold in ROS release and associated ratios, which remained low until a low level of mitochondrial activity was reached (30–40% of maximal oxidative phosphorylation activity)."

Local and hormonal neuromodulation and sensory inputs into these central pattern generator circuits play a significant role in an animal's response to perturbations, but are usually lost or removed during in vitro studies. To examine simultaneously the in vivo motor output of the crustacean heart and pyloric rhythms, we used photoplethysmography. In the population measured (n=49), the heart rhythm frequency ranged from 0.3 to 2.3 Hz. The pyloric rhythm varied from 0.2 to 1.6 Hz. We observed a weak correlation between the frequencies of the heart and pyloric rhythms. During multiple hour-long recordings, many animals held at a controlled temperature showed strong inhibitory bouts in which the heart decreased in frequency or become quiescent and the pyloric rhythm decreased in frequency. We measured the simultaneous responses of the rhythms to temperature ramps by heating or cooling the saline bath while recording both the heart and pyloric muscle movements. Q10, critical temperature (temperature at which muscle function is compromised) and changes in frequency were calculated for each of the rhythms tested. The heart rhythm was more robust to high temperature than the pyloric rhythm."

        "abstract": "We previously demonstrated the existence of a naturally occurring metabolic disease phenotype in Libellula pulchella dragonflies that shows high similarity to vertebrate obesity and type II diabetes, and is caused by a protozoan gut parasite. To further mechanistic understanding of how this metabolic disease phenotype affects fitness of male L. pulchella in vivo, we examined infection effects on in situ muscle performance and molecular traits relevant to dragonfly flight performance in nature. Importantly, these traits were previously shown to be affected in obese vertebrates. Similarly to obesity effects in rat skeletal muscle, dragonfly gut infection caused a disruption of relationships between body mass, flight muscle power output and alternative pre-mRNA splicing of troponin T, which affects muscle calcium sensitivity and performance in insects and vertebrates. In addition, when simulated in situ to contract at cycle frequencies ranging from 20 to 45 Hz, flight muscles of infected individuals displayed a left shift in power–cycle frequency curves, indicating a significant reduction in their optimal cycle frequency. Interestingly, these power–cycle curves were similar to those produced by flight muscles of non-infected teneral (i.e. physiologically immature) adult L. pulchella males. Overall, our results indicate that the effects of metabolic disease on skeletal muscle physiology in natural insect systems are similar to those observed in vertebrates maintained in laboratory settings. More generally, they indicate that study of natural, host–parasite interactions can contribute important insight into how environmental factors other than diet and exercise may contribute to the development of metabolic disease phenotypes."

        "abstract": "During buzz pollination, bees use their indirect flight muscles to produce vibrations that are transmitted to the flowers and result in pollen release. Although buzz pollination has been known for >100 years, we are still in the early stages of understanding how bee and floral characteristics affect the production and transmission of floral vibrations. Here, we analysed floral vibrations produced by four closely related bumblebee taxa (Bombus spp.) on two buzz-pollinated plants species (Solanum spp.). We measured floral vibrations transmitted to the flower to establish the extent to which the mechanical properties of floral vibrations depend on bee and plant characteristics. By comparing four bee taxa visiting the same plant species, we found that peak acceleration, root mean-squared acceleration (RMS) and frequency vary between bee taxa, but that neither bee size (intertegular distance) nor flower biomass (dry mass) affects peak acceleration, RMS or frequency. A comparison of floral vibrations of two bee taxa visiting flowers of two plant species showed that, while bee species affects peak acceleration, RMS and frequency, plant species only affects acceleration (peak acceleration and RMS), not frequency. When accounting for differences in the transmission of vibrations across the two types of flower, using a species-specific ‘coupling factor’, we found that RMS acceleration and peak displacement do not differ between plant species. This suggests that bees produce the same initial acceleration in different plants but that transmission of these vibrations through the flower is affected by floral characteristics."

        "abstract": "Aerial migration is the fastest, yet most energetically demanding way of seasonal movement between habitats. However, for many taxa, and bats in particular, we lack a clear understanding of the energy requirements for migration. Here, we examined the energetic cost and flight speed of the long-distance migratory Nathusius’ bat (Pipistrellus nathusii). We measured flight metabolism in relation to airspeed in a wind tunnel, inferred the optimal traveling speed over long distances, i.e. maximum range speed, and compared this value with flight speed measured in wild conspecifics. Body mass and wing morphologies were similar in captive and wild bats, indicating that the body condition of captive bats was similar to that of migratory bats. Nine out of the 12 captive bats exhibited a U-shaped relationship between flight metabolic power and airspeed when flying in the wind tunnel. The flight metabolic rate across all airspeeds averaged 0.98±0.28 W, which corresponds well to established allometric relationships between flight metabolic rate and body mass for bats. During summer migration, P. nathusii traveled at an average speed of 6.9±0.7 m s−1, which was significantly higher than the minimum power speed (5.8±1.0 m s−1), yet within the range of expected maximum range speed inferred from wind tunnel experiments. This suggests that P. nathusii may migrate at an energetically optimal speed and that aerial refueling does not substantially lower migratory speed in P. nathusii."

        "abstract": "The resistance of macroalgae to damage by hydrodynamic forces depends on the mechanical properties of their tissues. Although factors such as water-flow environment, algal growth rate and damage by herbivores have been shown to influence various material properties of macroalgal tissues, the interplay of these factors as they change seasonally and affect algal mechanical performance has not been worked out. We used the perennial kelp Egregia menziesii to study how the material properties of the rachis supporting a frond changed seasonally over a 2 year period, and how those changes correlated with seasonal patterns of the environment, growth rate and herbivore load. Rachis tissue became stiffer, stronger and less extensible with age (distance from the meristem). Thus, slowly growing rachises were stiffer, stronger and tougher than rapidly growing ones. Growth rates were highest in spring and summer when upwelling and long periods of daylight occurred. Therefore, rachis tissue was most resistant to damage in the winter, when waves were large as a result of seasonal storms. Herbivory was greatest during summer, when rachis growth rates were high. Unlike other macroalgae, E. menziesii did not respond to herbivore damage by increasing rachis tissue strength, but rather by growing in width so that the cross-sectional area of the wounded rachis was increased. The relative timing of environmental factors that affect growth rates (e.g. upwelling supply of nutrients, daylight duration) and of those that can damage macroalgae (e.g. winter storms, summer herbivore outbreaks) can influence the material properties and thus the mechanical performance of macroalgae."

Here, we demonstrate that the type of Wolbachia infection determines the effect on Drosophila melanogaster egg production as a proxy for fecundity, and metabolism of juvenile hormone (JH), which acts as gonadotropin in adult insects. For this study, we used six D. melanogaster lineages carrying the nuclear background of interbred Bi90 lineage and cytoplasmic backgrounds with or without Wolbachia of different genotype variants. The wMelCS genotype of Wolbachia decreases egg production in infected D. melanogaster females in the beginning of oviposition and increases it later (from the sixth day after eclosion), whereas the wMelPop Wolbachia strain causes the opposite effect, and the wMel, wMel2 and wMel4 genotypes of Wolbachia do not show any effect on these traits compared with uninfected Bi90 D. melanogaster females. The intensity of JH catabolism negatively correlates with the fecundity level in the flies carrying both wMelCS and wMelPop Wolbachia. The JH catabolism in females infected with genotypes of the wMel group does not differ from that in uninfected females. The effects of wMelCS and wMelPop infection on egg production can be levelled by the modulation of JH titre (via precocene/JH treatment of the flies). Thus, at least one of the mechanisms promoting the effect of Wolbachia on D. melanogaster female fecundity is mediated by JH."

However, it remains unclear how these defenses work. The present study examined changes in key enzymes of the enzymatic antioxidant system and the glutathione (GSH) system at both the mRNA and enzyme activity levels during acute cold exposure and recovery in juvenile Chinese soft-shelled turtles, Pelodiscus sinensis. Transcript levels of the upstream regulator NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were also measured. Turtles were acclimated at 28°C (3 weeks), then given acute cold exposure (8°C, 12 h) and finally placed in recovery (28°C, 24 h). The mRNA levels of cerebral and hepatic Nrf2 and of genes encoding downstream antioxidant enzymes did not change, whereas levels of nephric Nrf2, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) mRNA decreased upon cold exposure. During recovery, Nrf2 mRNA remained stable in all three tissues, hepatic Cu/ZnSOD, MnSOD and catalase (CAT) mRNA levels increased, and nephric MnSOD and GPx4 mRNAs did not change from the values during cold exposure. In the GSH system, mRNA levels of most enzymes remained constant during cold exposure and recovery. Unmatched with changes in mRNA level, high and stable constitutive antioxidant enzyme activities were maintained throughout, whereas GPx activity significantly reduced in the kidney during cold exposure, and in liver and kidney during recovery. Our results suggest that the antioxidant defense regulation in response to acute cold exposure in P. sinensis may not be achieved at the transcriptional level, but may rely mainly on high constitutive antioxidant enzyme activities."

        "abstract": "In coastal ecosystems, attributes of fluid motion can prompt animal larvae to rise or sink in the water column and to select microhabitats within which they attach and commit to a benthic existence. In echinoid (sea urchin and sand dollar) larvae living along wave-exposed shorelines, intense turbulence characteristic of surf zones can cause individuals to undergo an abrupt life-history shift characterized by precocious entry into competence – the stage at which larvae will settle and complete metamorphosis in response to local cues. However, the mechanistic details of this turbulence-triggered onset of competence remain poorly defined. Here, we evaluate in a series of laboratory experiments the time course of this turbulence effect, both the rapidity with which it initiates and whether it perdures. We found that larvae become competent with turbulence exposures as brief as 30 s, with longer exposures inducing a greater proportion of larvae to become competent. Intriguingly, larvae can remember such exposures for a protracted period (at least 24 h), a pattern reminiscent of long-term potentiation. Turbulence also induces short-term behavioral responses that last less than 30 min, including cessation of swimming, that facilitate sinking and thus contact of echinoid larvae with the substratum. Together, these results yield a novel perspective on how larvae find their way to suitable adult habitat at the critical settlement transition, and also open new experimental opportunities to elucidate the mechanisms by which planktonic animals respond to fluid motion."

        "abstract": "Some fishes and sea turtles are distinct from ectotherms by having elevated core body temperatures and metabolic rates. Quantifying the energetics and activity of the regionally endothermic species will help us understand how a fundamental biophysical process (i.e. temperature-dependent metabolism) shapes animal ecology; however, such information is limited owing to difficulties in studying these large, highly active animals. White sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, are the largest fish with regional endothermy, and potentially among the most energy-demanding fishes. Here, we deployed multi-sensor loggers on eight white sharks aggregating near colonies of long-nosed fur seals, Arctocephalus forsteri, off the Neptune Islands, Australia. Simultaneous measurements of depth, swim speed (a proxy for swimming metabolic rate) and body acceleration (indicating when sharks exhibited energy-efficient gliding behaviour) revealed their fine-scale swimming behaviour and allowed us to estimate their energy expenditure. Sharks repeatedly dived (mean swimming depth, 29 m) and swam at the surface between deep dives (maximum depth, 108 m). Modal swim speeds (0.80–1.35 m s−1) were slower than the estimated speeds that minimize cost of transport (1.3–1.9 m s−1), a pattern analogous to a ‘sit-and-wait’ strategy for a perpetually swimming species. All but one shark employed unpowered gliding during descents, rendering deep (>50 m) dives 29% less costly than surface swimming, which may incur additional wave drag. We suggest that these behavioural strategies may help sharks to maximize net energy gains by reducing swimming cost while increasing encounter rates with fast-swimming seals."

        "abstract": "The interplay between morphological specialization and kinematic flexibility is important for organisms that move between habitats within different substrates. Burrowing is energetically expensive and requires substantial interaction with soil to dislodge and transport it. True moles (Talpidae) have extraordinary forelimb morphologies and a unique ability to dig in loose as well as compact soils, yet we know little of how moles coordinate their forelimb joint kinematics when digging in soils of different compactness. Using marker-based X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM), we tested the hypothesis that moles burrow using different forelimb kinematics in loose and compact substrates. We predicted that moles raise mounds of loose soil by performing powerful compacting strokes mainly with long-axis rotation of the humerus (i.e. pronation/supination), but shear compact soil away by performing scratching strokes involving amplified elbow extension, similar to most scratching diggers. We also predicted that in both types of substrate, moles displace soil rearward like other mammalian diggers. Our results support our hypothesis but not the predictions. Eastern moles (Scalopus aquaticus) move substrates upward using compacting strokes in loose substrates and outward from the body midline using scratching strokes in compact substrates; unlike the digging strokes of most mammalian forelimb diggers, the power-stroke of moles itself does not displace substrates directly rearward. Compacting and scratching strokes involve similar ranges of humeral pronation and retraction at the scapulohumeral (shoulder) joint, yet the movements at the elbow and carpal joints differ. Our results demonstrate that the combination of stereotypic movements of the shoulder joint, where the largest digging muscles are located, and flexibility in the elbow and carpal joints makes moles extremely effective diggers in both loose and compact substrates."

Earlier studies on visuomotor control in birds, which were conducted mostly in pigeons, suggested that avian pecking is controlled feedforwardly, and is out of the control of visual guidance during movement. However, recent studies using crows suggested a role of vision in pecking control during movement. To unveil what visuomotor mechanisms underlie the flexibility of pecking in crows, we examined whether pigeons and crows adjust their pecking to the visual distortion induced by prisms. Because prisms induce visual shifts of object positions, birds were required to adjust their movements. Pecking kinematics were examined before and after attaching prisms in front of the birds' eyes. Analysis of lateral deviation caused by the prisms showed that crows rapidly adjusted their pecking trajectories, but pigeons did so slowly. Angular displacement also increased in pigeons after attachment of the prism, but decreased in crows. These responses to prisms were consistent among individuals in pigeons but varied in crows, though the adjustment of pecking commonly succeeded in crows. These results suggest that pecking in pigeons predominantly involves feedforward control and that the movement is determined depending on the visual information available before the initiation of pecking. In contrast, the results from crows suggest that their pecking trajectories are corrected during the movement, supporting on-line visual control. Our findings provide the first evidence to suggest the on-line visual control of pecking in birds."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/4/jeb187211",
        "abstract": "Flies fly at a broad range of speeds and produce sophisticated aerial maneuvers with precisely controlled wing movements. Remarkably, only subtle changes in wing motion are used by flies to produce aerial maneuvers, resulting in little directional tilt of the aerodynamic force vector relative to the body. Therefore, it is often considered that flies fly according to a helicopter model and control speed mainly via force vectoring by body pitch change. Here, we examined the speed control of bluebottle flies using a magnetically levitated (MAGLEV) flight mill, as they fly at different body pitch angles and with different augmented aerodynamic damping. We identified wing kinematic contributors to the changes of estimated aerodynamic force through testing and comparing two force-vectoring models – a constant force-vectoring model and a variable force-vectoring model – while using Akaike's information criterion for selection of the best-approximating model. The results show that the best-approximating variable force-vectoring model, which includes the effects of wing kinematic changes, yields a considerably more accurate prediction of flight speed, particularly in higher velocity range, as compared with those of the constant force-vectoring model. Examination of the variable force-vectoring model reveals that, in the flight mill tethered flight, flies use a collection of wing kinematic variables to control primarily the force magnitude, while the force direction is also modulated, albeit to a smaller extent compared with those due to the changes in body pitch. The roles of these wing kinematic variables are analogous to those of throttle, and collective and cyclic pitch of helicopters."

        "abstract": "Daphnia spp., a keystone genus in freshwater lentic habitats, are subject to environmental sex determination wherein environmental conditions dictate offspring sex and whether they reproduce asexually or sexually. The introduction of males into a population denotes the first step in the switch from asexual parthenogenetic reproduction to sexual reproduction. We tested the hypothesis that photoperiod and temperature co-regulate male sex determination and that these environmental stimuli would activate elements of the male sex determination signaling cascade. The results revealed that photoperiod was a critical cue in creating permissive conditions for male production. Further, under photoperiod-induced permissive conditions, male sex determination was temperature dependent. The two daphnid species evaluated, Daphnia pulex and Daphnia magna, exhibited different temperature dependencies. Daphnia pulex produced fewer males with increasing temperatures between 16 and 22°C, and D. magna exhibited the opposite trend. We found consistent expression patterns of key genes along the male sex-determining signaling pathway in D. pulex independent of environmental stimuli. mRNA levels for the enzyme responsible for synthesis of the male sex-determining hormone, methyl farnesoate, were elevated early in the reproductive cycle, followed by increased mRNA levels of the methyl farnesoate receptor subunits Met and SRC. Environmental conditions that stimulated male offspring production significantly increased Met mRNA levels. The results indicate that male sex determination in daphnids is under the permissive control of photoperiod and the regulatory control of temperature. Further, these environmental cues may stimulate male sex determination by increasing levels of the Met subunit of the methyl farnesoate receptor."

        "abstract": "Physical aerobic activity is oxygen demanding, but – particularly for birds – there is still little understanding of how blood contributes to oxygen supply under various activity levels. In a two-factorial experimental design, we investigated the long-term effect of daily flight training and the immediate effect of a short exercise bout on a set of haematological variables: haemoglobin (Hb) content, haematocrit (Hct), and red blood cell number (RBCcount) and size (RBCarea) in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). For a period of 6 weeks, birds were either trained daily for 3 h in a flight arena or remained untrained. Subsequently, half of each group was blood sampled either in the resting condition or after a 5 min exercise bout in a flight-hover wheel. We found significantly lower Hb content, Hct and RBCcount compared with that in untrained controls in response to training, while RBCarea did not differ between treatments. Response to an exercise bout revealed the opposite pattern, with significantly higher Hb content and Hct compared with that in non-exercised birds. Additionally, RBCarea was significantly smaller immediately after exercise compared with that in non-exercised birds, and such short-term flexibility represents a novel finding for birds. This contrasting response in erythrocyte characteristics with respect to long-term training and short exercise bouts appears as a clear pattern, presumably underlain by changes in water balance. We infer alterations of blood flow to be involved in adequate oxygen supply. During an exercise bout, RBCarea flexibility may not only enhance oxygen delivery through improved erythrocyte surface area to volume ratio but also improve blood flow through a compensatory effect on blood viscosity."

        "abstract": "Early-life stress can suppress immune function, but it is unclear whether transgenerational stress exposure modulates the immune consequences of early stress. In populations where, historically, the immune system is frequently activated, e.g. persistent stressors that cause injury, it may be maladaptive to suppress immune function after early-life stress. Thus, the relationship between early-life stress and immune function may vary with population-level historical stressor exposure. We collected gravid fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) from populations that naturally differ in long-term exposure to invasive fire ants (Solenopsis invicta). We manipulated early-life stress in the resulting offspring via weekly exposure to fire ants, application of the stress-relevant hormone corticosterone or control treatment from 2 to 43 weeks of age. We quantified adult immune function in these offspring with baseline and antigen-induced hemagglutination and plasma bacterial killing ability. Early-life corticosterone exposure suppressed baseline hemagglutination in offspring of lizards from populations not exposed to fire ants but enhanced hemagglutination in those from populations that were exposed to fire ants. This enhancement may prepare lizards for high rates of wounding, toxin exposure and infection associated with fire ant attack. Adult bacterial killing ability and hemagglutination were not affected by early-life exposure to fire ants, but the latter was higher in offspring of lizards from invaded sites. A population's history of persistent stress may thus alter individual long-term immunological responses to early-life stressors. Further consideration of historical stressor exposure (type and duration) may be important to better understand how early-life stressors affect adult physiology."

        "abstract": "Periods of food deprivation of several months are common events for fishes and in such conditions, fitness will be determined by their capacity to maximize food encounters while minimizing predation risk. In this context, the propensity to take risks and the willingness to associate with conspecifics are particularly important as they contribute to alleviating the trade-off between predation avoidance and foraging efficiency. This study examined to what extent food deprivation modulates fish risk-taking and social behaviours, as well as the relationship between them. To address these issues, juvenile European sea bass were either fed daily with a maintenance ration or food deprived for a period of 3 weeks. Risk taking and sociability were assessed through measurements of fish willingness to explore a novel environment, and to interact with a novel object or a conspecific. Multivariate analysis allowed the identification of three behaviours: risk taking, exploratory activity and solitariness. Food-deprived fish interacted less with conspecifics than control fish; however, no difference in terms of risk taking and exploratory patterns was observed. Finally, the relationship between risk taking and solitariness was influenced by feeding status. When food-deprived, fish with a higher propensity to take risk displayed increased solitariness, while when fed normally, they interacted more with conspecifics."

        "abstract": "Spittlebugs (superfamily Cercopoidea) live within a mass of frothy, spittle-like foam that is produced as a by-product of their xylem-feeding habits. The wet spittle represents a unique respiratory environment for an insect, potentially acting either as a reserve of trapped oxygen (O2) or as a significant barrier to O2 diffusion from the surrounding atmosphere. Feeding on xylem sap under tension is also assumed to be energetically expensive, potentially placing further constraints on their gas exchange. To understand the respiratory strategies used by spittlebugs, this study measured the PO2 within the spittle of the meadow spittlebug, Philaenus spumarius, as well as the non-feeding metabolic rate (RMR) and respiratory quotient (RQ) of both nymphs and adults. The metabolic rate of nymphs feeding on xylem was also measured. In separate experiments, the ability of a nymph to obtain O2 from bubbles while submerged in foam was determined using a glass microscope slide coated in an O2-sensitive fluorophore. We determined that P. spumarius breathes atmospheric O2 by extending the tip of its abdomen outside of its spittle, rather than respiring the O2 trapped in air bubbles within the foam. However, spittlebugs can temporarily use these air bubbles to breathe when forcibly submerged. V̇O2 and V̇CO2 did not differ statistically within life stages, giving a RQ of 0.92 for nymphs and 0.95 for adults. Feeding on xylem was found to increase the nymphs' V̇CO2 by only 20% above their RMR. From this cost of feeding, cibarial pump pressures were estimated to be between −0.05 and −0.26 MPa."

        "abstract": "The mineralized eggshell of Reptilia was a major innovation in the evolution of the amniotic egg. Inorganic components strengthen the eggshell and are a potential source of nutrients to developing embryos. Embryos of oviparous reptiles do extract calcium from eggshells but vary interspecifically in exploitation of this resource. The pattern of embryonic calcium nutrition of the corn snake, Pantherophis guttatus, is similar to a diversity of squamate species: embryos obtain most calcium from yolk, yet also mobilize calcium from the eggshell. We tested the hypothesis that embryonic development is not dependent on eggshell calcium by manipulating calcium availability. We peeled away the outer calcareous layer of the eggshell of recently oviposited eggs; control eggs were left intact. Eggs were sampled periodically and calcium content of egg compartments (embryo, yolk, eggshell) was measured. We also analyzed skeletal development and size of hatchlings. There was no difference in survivorship or length of incubation between treatments. However, hatchlings from intact eggs contained more calcium and were larger in mass and length than siblings from peeled eggs. There were no observable differences in ossification but hatchlings from intact eggs had larger skeletal elements (skull, vertebrae). Our results indicate that mobilization of eggshell calcium is not a requirement for embryonic development of P. guttatus and that embryos augment yolk calcium by extracting calcium from the eggshell. This pattern of embryonic calcium nutrition would favor embryos with a greater capacity to mobilize calcium from the eggshell by promoting growth and thereby potentially enhancing hatchling fitness."

        "abstract": "Calcium and phosphorus (P) are the main bone minerals, and P deficiency can cause hypomineralized bones (osteomalacia) and malformations. This study used a P-deficient salmon model to falsify three hypotheses. First, an extended period of dietary P deficiency does not cause pathologies other than osteomalacia. Second, secondary mineralization of non-mineralized bone is possible. Third, secondary mineralization can restore the bones' mineral composition and mechanical properties. For 7 weeks, post-smolt Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) received diets with regular P content (RP) or with a 50% lowered P content (LP). For additional 9 weeks, RP animals continued on the regular diet (RP-RP). LP animals continued on the LP diet (LP-LP), on a regular P diet (LP-RP) or on a high P diet (LP-HP). After 16 weeks, animals in all groups maintained a non-deformed vertebral column. LP-LP animals continued bone formation albeit without mineralization. Nine weeks of RP diet largely restored the mineral content and mechanical properties of vertebral bodies. Mineralization resumed deep inside the bone and away from osteoblasts. The history of P deficiency was traceable in LP-RP and LP-HP animals as a ring of low-mineralized bone in the vertebral body endplates, but no tissue alterations occurred that foreshadow vertebral body compression or fusion. Large quantities of non-mineralized salmon bone have the capacity to re-mineralize. If 16 weeks of P deficiency as a single factor is not causal for typical vertebral body malformations, other factors remain to be identified. This example of functional bone without minerals may explain why some teleost species can afford to have an extremely low mineralized skeleton."

        "abstract": "Food shortage represents a primary challenge to survival, and animals have adapted diverse developmental, physiological and behavioral strategies to survive when food becomes unavailable. Starvation resistance is strongly influenced by ecological and evolutionary history, yet the genetic basis for the evolution of starvation resistance remains poorly understood. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster provides a powerful model for leveraging experimental evolution to investigate traits associated with starvation resistance. While control populations only live a few days without food, selection for starvation resistance results in populations that can survive weeks. We have previously shown that selection for starvation resistance results in increased sleep and reduced feeding in adult flies. Here, we investigate the ontogeny of starvation resistance-associated behavioral and metabolic phenotypes in these experimentally selected flies. We found that selection for starvation resistance resulted in delayed development and a reduction in metabolic rate in larvae that persisted into adulthood, suggesting that these traits may allow for the accumulation of energy stores and an increase in body size within these selected populations. In addition, we found that larval sleep was largely unaffected by starvation selection and that feeding increased during the late larval stages, suggesting that experimental evolution for starvation resistance produces developmentally specified changes in behavioral regulation. Together, these findings reveal a critical role for development in the evolution of starvation resistance and indicate that selection can selectively influence behavior during defined developmental time points."

        "abstract": "Hyperosmotic stress may result in osmotic volume loss from the body to the environment in animals that cannot control the water permeability of their integument. Euryhaline animals (which have a wide tolerance range of environmental salinities) have generally evolved the ability to counteract cell volume shrinkage by accumulating inorganic and organic osmolytes within their cells to balance internal and external osmolalities. Molluscs use very different combinations of amino acids and amino acid derivatives to achieve this goal. Theodoxus fluviatilis is a neritid gastropod that is distributed not only in limnic habitats in Europe but also in brackish waters (e.g. along the shoreline of the Baltic Sea). Animals from brackish sites survive better in high salinities than animals from freshwater locations. The results of the present study indicate that these differences in salinity tolerance cannot be explained by differences in the general ability to accumulate amino acids as organic osmolytes. Although there may be differences in the metabolic pathways involved in osmolyte accumulation in foot muscle tissue, the two groups of animals accumulate amino acid mixtures equally well when stepwise acclimated to their respective maximum tolerable salinity for extended periods. Among these amino acids, alanine and proline, as well as the osmolyte urea, hold a special importance for cell volume preservation in T. fluviatilis under hyperosmotic stress. It is possible that the accumulation of various amino acids during hyperosmotic stress occurs via hydrolysis of storage proteins, while alanine and proline are probably newly synthesised under conditions of hyperosmotic stress in the animals."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/3/jeb189423",
        "abstract": "The integration of distinct sensory modalities is essential for behavioural decision making. In Caenorhabditis elegans, this process is coordinated by neural circuits that integrate sensory cues from the environment to generate an appropriate behaviour at the appropriate output muscles. Food is a multimodal cue that impacts the microcircuits to modulate feeding and foraging drivers at the level of the pharyngeal and body wall muscle, respectively. When food triggers an upregulation in pharyngeal pumping, it allows the effective ingestion of food. Here, we show that a C. elegans mutant in the single gene orthologous to human neuroligins, nlg-1, is defective in food-induced pumping. This was not due to an inability to sense food, as nlg-1 mutants were not defective in chemotaxis towards bacteria. In addition, we found that neuroligin is widely expressed in the nervous system, including AIY, ADE, ALA, URX and HSN neurons. Interestingly, despite the deficit in pharyngeal pumping, neuroligin was not expressed within the pharyngeal neuromuscular network, which suggests an extrapharyngeal regulation of this circuit. We resolved electrophysiologically the neuroligin contribution to the pharyngeal circuit by mimicking food-dependent pumping and found that the nlg-1 phenotype is similar to mutants impaired in GABAergic and/or glutamatergic signalling. We suggest that neuroligin organizes extrapharyngeal circuits that regulate the pharynx. These observations based on the molecular and cellular determinants of feeding are consistent with the emerging role of neuroligin in discretely impacting functional circuits underpinning complex behaviours."

        "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster hear with their antennae: sound evokes vibration of the distal antennal segment, and this vibration is transduced by specialized mechanoreceptor cells. The left and right antennae vibrate preferentially in response to sounds arising from different azimuthal angles. Therefore, by comparing signals from the two antennae, it should be possible to obtain information about the azimuthal angle of a sound source. However, behavioral evidence of sound localization has not been reported in Drosophila. Here, we show that walking D. melanogaster do indeed turn in response to lateralized sounds. We confirm that this behavior is evoked by vibrations of the distal antennal segment. The rule for turning is different for sounds arriving from different locations: flies turn toward sounds in their front hemifield, but they turn away from sounds in their rear hemifield, and they do not turn at all in response to sounds from 90 or −90 deg. All of these findings can be explained by a simple rule: the fly steers away from the antenna with the larger vibration amplitude. Finally, we show that these behaviors generalize to sound stimuli with diverse spectro-temporal features, and that these behaviors are found in both sexes. Our findings demonstrate the behavioral relevance of the antenna's directional tuning properties. They also pave the way for investigating the neural implementation of sound localization, as well as the potential roles of sound-guided steering in courtship and exploration."

        "abstract": "In severe hypoxia, most vertebrates increase anaerobic energy production, which results in the development of a metabolic acidosis and an O2 debt that must be repaid during reoxygenation. Naked mole rats (NMRs) are among the most hypoxia-tolerant mammals, capable of drastically reducing their metabolic rate in acute hypoxia while staying active and alert. We hypothesized that a key component of remaining active is an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism during severe hypoxia. To test this hypothesis, we exposed NMRs to progressive reductions in inspired O2 (9–3% O2) followed by reoxygenation (21% O2) and measured breathing frequency, heart rate, behavioural activity, body temperature, metabolic rate, and also metabolic substrates and pH in blood and tissues. We found that NMRs exhibit robust metabolic rate depression in acute hypoxia, accompanied by declines in all physiological and behavioural variables examined. However, blood and tissue pH were unchanged, and tissue concentrations of ATP and phosphocreatine were maintained. NMRs increased their reliance on carbohydrates in hypoxia, and glucose was mobilized from the liver to the blood. Upon reoxygenation, NMRs entered into a coma-like state for ∼15–20 min, during which metabolic rate was negligible and body temperature remained suppressed. However, an imbalance in the time taken for the rates of O2 uptake (V̇O2) and CO2 production (V̇CO2) to return to normoxic levels during reoxygenation hint at the possibility that NMRs do utilize anaerobic metabolism during hypoxia but have a tissue and/or blood buffering capacity that masks typical markers of metabolic acidosis, and that the synthesis of glucose from lactate, rather than lactate oxidation, is prioritized during recovery."

        "abstract": "Studies of odontocete foraging ecology have been limited by the challenges of observing prey capture events and outcomes underwater. We sought to determine whether subsurface movement behavior recorded from archival tags could accurately identify foraging events by fish-eating killer whales. We used multisensor bio-logging tags attached by suction cups to Southern Resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) to: (1) identify a stereotyped movement signature that co-occurred with visually confirmed prey capture dives; (2) construct a prey capture dive detector and validate it against acoustically confirmed prey capture dives; and (3) demonstrate the utility of the detector by testing hypotheses about foraging ecology. Predation events were significantly predicted by peaks in the rate of change of acceleration (‘jerk peak’), roll angle and heading variance. Detection of prey capture dives by movement signatures enabled substantially more dives to be included in subsequent analyses compared with previous surface or acoustic detection methods. Males made significantly more prey capture dives than females and more dives to the depth of their preferred prey, Chinook salmon. Additionally, only half of the tag deployments on females (5 out of 10) included a prey capture dive, whereas all tag deployments on males exhibited at least one prey capture dive (12 out of 12). This dual approach of kinematic detection of prey capture coupled with hypothesis testing can be applied across odontocetes and other marine predators to investigate the impacts of social, environmental and anthropogenic factors on foraging ecology."

These metabolic adjustments involve plastic and/or genetic traits and pathways depend on species-specific ecological contexts. Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) are ecologically unique among the Pacific salmonids as early-run and late-run populations are commonly observed in every part of their range. In the Sanriku coastal area, Japan, early-run adults experience high water temperatures (12–24°C) during their migration, compared with those of the late-run adults (4–15°C), suggesting that the two populations might have different thermal performance. Here, we found population-specific differences in the thermal sensitivities of metabolic rates [resting metabolic rate, RMR, and maximum (aerobic) metabolic rate, MMR] and critical temperature maxima. Using these parameters, we estimated thermal performance curves of absolute aerobic scope (AAS). The populations had different thermal performance curves of AAS, and in both populations high values of AAS were maintained throughout the range of ecologically relevant temperatures. However, the populations did not vary substantially in the peak (AAS at optimal temperature, ToptAAS) or breadth (width of sub-optimal temperature range) of the performance curves. The AAS curve of early-run fish was shifted approximately 3°C higher than that of late-run fish. Furthermore, when the data for RMR and MMR were aligned to the thermal differences from ToptAAS, it became clear that the populations did not differ in the temperature dependence of their metabolic traits. Our results indicate that chum salmon thermally accommodate through compensatory alterations in metabolic rates. Our results imply that metabolic plasticity and/or the effect of genetic variance on plasticity might play a pivotal role in their thermal accommodation."

        "abstract": "The search for variables involved in the regulation and termination of exercise performance has led to integrative models that attribute a central role to the brain and utilize an array of psychological terms (e.g. sensation, perception, discomfort, tolerance). We propose that theorizing about exercise regulation would benefit from establishing cross-disciplinary bridges to research fields, such as affective psychology and neuroscience, in which changes along the dimension of pleasure–displeasure are considered the main channel via which homeostatic perturbations enter consciousness and dictate corrective action (slowing down or stopping). We hypothesized that ratings of pleasure–displeasure would respond to the severity of homeostatic perturbation and would be related to time to exhaustion during exercise performed at an unsustainable intensity. In a within-subjects experiment (N=15, 13 men and 2 women, age 23.4±2.2 years; maximal oxygen uptake 46.0±8.0 ml kg−1 min−1), we compared the slope of ratings of pleasure–displeasure (acquired every 1 min) during cycling exercise at a power output 10% above critical power until volitional termination under glycogen-loaded and glycogen-depleted conditions. As hypothesized, ratings of pleasure–displeasure declined more steeply under glycogen depletion (P=0.009, d=0.70) and correlated closely with time to exhaustion under both glycogen-loaded (r=0.85; P<0.001) and glycogen-depleted conditions (r=0.83; P<0.001). We conclude that in exercise, as in other domains, changes in pleasure–displeasure may be the main channel via which homeostatic perturbations enter consciousness. This proposal may have important implications for conceptualizing and identifying the neurobiological mechanisms of the sense of exertional physical fatigue."

Either aerodynamic or inertial forces generated by appendages and other structures, such as the tail, may be used to offset aerial perturbations, but these responses have not been well characterized. To better understand how hummingbirds modify wing and tail motions in response to individual gusts, we filmed Anna's hummingbirds as they negotiated an upward jet of fast-moving air. Birds exhibited large variation in wing elevation, tail pitch and tail fan angles among transits as they repeatedly negotiated the same gust, and often exhibited a dramatic decrease in body angle (29±6 deg) post-transit. After extracting three-dimensional kinematic features, we identified a spectrum of control strategies for gust transit, with one extreme involving continuous flapping, no tail fanning and little disruption to body posture (23±3 deg downward pitch), and the other extreme characterized by dorsal wing pausing, tail fanning and greater downward body pitch (38±4 deg). The use of a deflectable tail on a glider model transiting the same gust resulted in enhanced stability and can easily be implemented in the design of aerial robots."

When the scent of a crayfish predator (CE) is encountered in Lymnaea stagnalis strains known to be predator experienced (e.g. the W-strain), enhancement of memory formation and depression of feeding occur, which are part of a suite of anti-predator behaviours. We hypothesized that Lymnaea possess a form of higher-order conditioning, namely configural learning. We tested this by simultaneously exposing W-strain Lymnaea to a carrot food odour (CO) and predator scent (CE). Two hours later, we operantly conditioned these snails with a single 0.5 h training session in CO to determine whether training in CO results in long-term memory (LTM) formation. A series of control experiments followed and demonstrated that only the CO+CE snails trained in CO had acquired enhanced memory-forming ability. Additionally, following CE+CO pairing, CO no longer elicited an increased feeding response. Hence, snails have the ability to undergo configural learning. Following configural learning, CO becomes a risk signal and evokes behavioural responses phenotypically similar to those elicited by exposure to CE."

        "abstract": "Background noise can have strong negative consequences for animals, reducing individual fitness by masking communication signals, impeding prey detection and increasing predation risk. While the negative impacts of noise across taxa have been well documented, the use of noise as an informational cue, providing animals with reliable information on environmental conditions, has been less well studied. In the tropical rainforest, downpours can be intense and frequent. Strong rainfall may impede efficient orientation and foraging for bats that need echolocation to both navigate and detect prey, and can result in higher flight costs due to increased metabolic rates. Using playback experiments at natural roosts, we tested whether two bat species, differing in their hunting strategies and foraging habitats, use rain noise as a cue to delay emergence from their roosts. We found that both species significantly delayed their emergence time during rain noise playbacks versus silence and ambient noise controls. We conclude that bats can use background noise, here the acoustic component of rainfall, as a reliable informational cue to make informed decisions, in this case about whether to initiate foraging trips or remain in the shelter of their roosts. Our findings suggest that environmental background noise can sometimes be beneficial to animals, in particular in situations where other sensory cues may be absent."

        "abstract": "Obligate hibernators express circannual patterns of body mass and hibernation, which persist under constant laboratory conditions. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is important for thermogenesis during arousals from hibernation, whereas white adipose tissue (WAT) serves as energy storage and thermal insulation. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of environmental temperature on BAT and WAT. We hypothesized that changes to environmental temperature would not influence the pattern of mass gain or BAT and WAT volume in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). To test this, we housed animals at thermoneutral 25°C (warm-housed) or 5°C (cold-housed), with the same photoperiod (12 h light:12 h dark) over an entire year. Throughout the year we measured the volume and water:fat ratio of WAT and BAT using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We found no evidence of torpor in the warm-housed animals, indicating that this species might not be an obligate hibernator, as previously assumed. Regardless of ambient temperature, BAT volume increased prior to winter, then decreased in late winter with no change in water:fat ratio. By contrast, both body mass and WAT volume of cold-housed animals declined throughout the winter and recovered after hibernation, but thermoneutral housing produced no circannual pattern in body mass, even though WAT volume declined in late winter. Cold exposure appears to be a primary regulator for WAT but BAT may exhibit an endogenous circannual rhythm in terms of depot volume."

        "abstract": "Several vertebrates, including fish, exhibit behavioural laterality and associated morphological asymmetry. Laterality may increase individual fitness as well as foraging strength, accuracy and speed. However, little is known about which behaviours are affected by laterality or what fish species exhibit obvious laterality. Previous research on the predatory behaviour of the scale-eating Lake Tanganyika cichlid Perissodus microlepis indicates behavioural laterality that reflects asymmetric jaw morphology. The Lake Malawi cichlid Genyochromis mento feeds on the fins of other fish, a behaviour that G. mento developed independently from the Tanganyikan Perissodini scale eaters. We investigated stomach contents and behavioural laterality of predation in aquarium to clarify the functional roles and evolution of laterality in cichlids. We also compared the behavioural laterality and mouth asymmetry of G. mento and P. microlepis. The diet of G. mento mostly includes fin fragments, but also scales of several fish species. Most individual G. mento specimens showed significant attack bias favouring the skew mouth direction. However, there was no difference in success rate between attacks from the preferred side and those from the non-preferred side, and no lateralized kinetic elements in predation behaviour. Genyochromis mento showed weaker laterality than P. microlepis, partly because of their different feeding habits, the phylogenetic constraints from their shorter evolutionary history and their origin from ancestor Haplochromini omnivorous/herbivorous species. Taken together, this study provides new insights into the functional roles of behavioural laterality: predatory fish aiming for prey that show escape behaviours frequently exhibit lateralized behaviour in predation."

        "abstract": "Prehensile and gripping organs are recurring structures in different organisms that enhance friction by the reinforcement and redirection of normal forces. The relationship between organ structure and biomechanical performance is poorly understood, despite a broad relevance for microhabitat choice, movement ecology and biomimetics. Here, we present the first study of the biomechanics of prehensile feet in long-legged harvestmen. These arachnids exhibit the strongest sub-division of legs among arthropods, permitting extreme hyperflexion (i.e. curling up the foot tip). We found that despite the lack of adhesive foot pads, these moderately sized arthropods are able to scale vertical smooth surfaces, if the surface is curved. Comparison of three species of harvestmen differing in leg morphology shows that traction reinforcement by foot wrapping depends on the degree of leg sub-division, not leg length. Differences are explained by adaptation to different microhabitats on trees. The exponential increase of foot section length from distal to proximal introduces a gradient of flexibility that permits adaptation to a wide range of surface curvature while maintaining integrity at strong flexion. A pulley system of the claw depressor tendon ensures the controlled flexion of the high number of adesmatic joints in the harvestman foot. These results contribute to the general understanding of foot function in arthropods and showcase an interesting model for the biomimetic engineering of novel transportation systems and surgical probes."

        "abstract": "Ureotelic elasmobranchs require nitrogen for both protein growth and urea-based osmoregulation, and therefore are probably nitrogen-limited in nature. Mechanisms exist for retaining and/or scavenging nitrogen in the gills, kidney, rectal gland and gut, but as yet, the latter are not well characterized. Intestinal sac preparations of the Pacific spiny dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias suckleyi) incubated in vitro strongly reabsorbed urea from the lumen after feeding, but mucosal fluid ammonia concentrations increased with incubation time. Phloretin (0.25 mmol l−1, which blocked urea reabsorption) greatly increased the rate of ammonia accumulation in the lumen. A sensitive [14C]urea-based assay was developed to examine the potential role of microbial urease in this ammonia production. Urease activity was detected in chyme/intestinal fluid and intestinal epithelial tissue of both fed and fasted sharks. Urease was not present in gall-bladder bile. Urease activities were highly variable among animals, but generally greater in chyme than in epithelia, and greater in fed than in fasted sharks. Comparable urease activities were found in chyme and epithelia of the Pacific spotted ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei), a ureotelic holocephalan, but were much lower in ammonotelic teleosts. Urease activity in dogfish chyme was inhibited by acetohydroxamic acid (1 mmol l−1) and by boiling. Treatment of dogfish gut sac preparations with acetohydroxamic acid blocked ammonia production, changing net ammonia accumulation into net ammonia absorption. We propose that microbial urease plays an important role in nitrogen handling in the elasmobranch intestine, allowing some urea-N to be converted to ammonia, which is then reabsorbed for amino acid synthesis or reconversion to urea."

        "abstract": "Bacterial and viral pathogens can weaken epithelial barriers by targeting and disrupting tight junction (TJ) proteins. However, comparatively little is known about the direct effects of fungal pathogens on TJ proteins and their expression. The disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is threatening amphibian populations worldwide. Bd is known to infect amphibian skin and disrupt cutaneous osmoregulation. However, exactly how this occurs is poorly understood. This study considered the impact of Bd infection on the barrier properties of the Australian green tree frog (Litoria caerulea) epidermis by examining how inoculation of animals with Bd influenced the paracellular movement of FITC-dextran (4 kDa, FD-4) across the skin in association with alterations in the mRNA and protein abundance of select TJ proteins of the epidermal TJ complex. It was observed that Bd infection increased paracellular movement of FD-4 across the skin linearly with fungal infection load. In addition, Bd infection increased transcript abundance of the tricellular TJ (tTJ) protein tricellulin (Tric) as well as the bicellular TJ (bTJ) proteins occludin (Ocln), claudin (Cldn)-1, Cldn-4 and the scaffolding TJ protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1). However, while Tric protein abundance increased in accord with changes in transcript abundance, protein abundance of Cldn-1 was significantly reduced and Ocln protein abundance was unchanged. Data indicate that disruption of cutaneous osmoregulation in L. caerulea following Bd infection occurs, at least in part, by an increase in epidermal paracellular permeability in association with compromised integrity of the epidermal TJ complex."

We analysed the relationships among personality traits (boldness, activity and hesitancy), agonistic behaviour and energy status (glycogen, glucose and lactate) in the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus. The main results were as follows. (1) Boldness was significantly correlated with activity and hesitancy. Bold crabs were more likely to initiate and win a fight. In bold individuals, the frequencies of ‘move to’, ‘cheliped display’, ‘grasp’ and ‘contact’ were significantly higher than those of shy individuals, whereas the frequency of ‘move away’ was significantly lower than that of shy individuals. (2) Before fighting, the glucose concentrations in the haemolymph of bold individuals were significantly lower than those of shy individuals, whereas the concentrations of lactate showed the opposite trend. There were no significant differences in glycogen and lactate concentrations in the claw muscle between bold and shy individuals. (3) After fighting, the glucose and lactate concentrations in the haemolymph of both bold and shy individuals were significantly higher than those before fighting. The glucose concentrations in the haemolymph were significantly higher in bold individuals than shy individuals. In addition, bold individuals showed a larger increase in glucose in the haemolymph but a smaller increase in lactate compared with shy individuals. (4) After fighting, the glycogen concentrations in the claw muscle were significantly lower than those before fighting; however, there were no significant differences in the concentrations of lactate in the claw muscle. These results indicated that the agonistic behaviour of the swimming crab is related to its behavioural type. Energy reserves may be one of the factors affecting the personality traits and agonistic behaviour in crabs. These results should lay a foundation for in-depth understanding of the relationships among crustacean personality, agonistic behaviour and metabolic physiology."

        "abstract": "Environmental hypoxia presents a metabolic challenge for animals because it inhibits mitochondrial respiration and can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We investigated the interplay between O2 use for aerobic respiration and ROS generation among sculpin fishes (Cottidae, Actinopterygii) that are known to vary in whole-animal hypoxia tolerance. We hypothesized that mitochondria from hypoxia-tolerant sculpins would show more efficient O2 use with a higher phosphorylation efficiency and lower ROS emission. We showed that brain mitochondria from more hypoxia-tolerant sculpins had lower complex I and higher complex II flux capacities compared with less hypoxia-tolerant sculpins, but these differences were not related to variation in phosphorylation efficiency (ADP/O) or mitochondrial coupling (respiratory control ratio). The hypoxia-tolerant sculpins had higher mitochondrial H2O2 emission per O2 consumed (H2O2/O2) under oligomycin-induced state 4 conditions compared with less hypoxia-tolerant sculpins. An in vitro redox challenge experiment revealed species differences in how well mitochondria defend their glutathione redox status when challenged with high levels of reduced glutathione, but the redox challenge elicited the same H2O2/O2 in all species. Furthermore, in vitro anoxia recovery lowered absolute H2O2 emission (H2O2 per mg mitochondrial protein) in all species and negatively impacted state 3 respiration rates in some species, but the responses were not related to hypoxia tolerance. Overall, we clearly demonstrate a relationship between hypoxia tolerance and complex I and II flux capacities in sculpins, but the differences in complex flux capacity do not appear to be directly related to variation in ROS metabolism."

Here, we present the first investigation of the degree of linear polarization threshold for orientation behaviour in a nocturnal species, with specific reference to the range of degrees of polarization measured in the night sky. An effect of lunar phase on the degree of polarization of skylight was found, with smaller illuminated fractions of the moon's surface corresponding to lower degrees of polarization in the night sky. We found that the South African dung beetle Escarabaeus satyrus can orient to polarized light for a range of degrees of polarization similar to that observed in diurnal insects, reaching a lower threshold between 0.04 and 0.32, possibly as low as 0.11. For degrees of polarization lower than 0.23, as measured on a crescent moon night, orientation performance was considerably weaker than that observed for completely linearly polarized stimuli, but was nonetheless stronger than in the absence of polarized light."

        "abstract": "The honey bee is the most frequently used species in pollination services for diverse crops. In onion crops (Allium cepa), however, bees avoid visiting certain varieties, being attracted differently to male sterile (MS) and fertile (OP) lines. These differences might be based on the phenolic profiles of the cultivars' nectars. To understand the relationship between nectar composition and pollinator attraction to different onion lines, we tested sensory and cognitive abilities and palatability in honey bees exposed to MS and OP onion nectars and sugar solutions mimicking them. We evaluated the proboscis extension response (PER) after antennal contact (unconditioned response) to MS or OP onion nectars, finding no statistical differences, which indicates similar gustatory perception for the two nectars. We also performed food uptake assays to test palatability of different artificial nectars, considering their flavonoids and potassium content. The presence of potassium decreased the palatability of the artificial nectars. Finally, we evaluated the bees’ cognitive abilities when the reward (unconditioned stimulus) offered during conditioning PER assays presents differences in composition. We found that potassium by itself impaired learning; however, such impairment was even higher when naringenin and quercetin were added in the unconditioned stimulus (MS nectar mimic). Interestingly, potassium together with luteolin (OP nectar mimic) improved learning. Our study demonstrates that the differences in the nectars' flavonoid profiles combined with their high potassium content could explain the previously reported differences in attractiveness between onion lines, suggesting an important role of nectar compounds other than sugars for the attractiveness of flowers to pollinators."

        "abstract": "Chytridiomycosis, a lethal fungal skin disease of amphibians, fatally disrupts ionic and osmotic homeostasis. Infected amphibians increase their skin shedding rate (sloughing) to slow pathogen growth, but the sloughing process also increases skin permeability. Healthy amphibians increase active ion uptake during sloughing by increasing ion transporter abundance to offset the increased skin permeability. How chytridiomycosis affects the skin function during and between sloughing events remains unknown. Here, we show that non-sloughing frogs with chytridiomycosis have impaired cutaneous sodium uptake, in part because they have fewer sodium transporters in their skin. Interestingly, sloughing was associated with a transient increase in sodium transporter activity and abundance, suggesting that the newly exposed skin layer is initially fully functional until the recolonization of the skin by the fungus again impedes cutaneous function. However, the temporary restoration of skin function during sloughing does not restore ionic homeostasis, and the underlying loss of ion uptake capacity is ultimately detrimental for amphibians with chytridiomycosis."

        "abstract": "A number of insects fly over long distances below the natural canopy, where the physical environment is highly cluttered consisting of obstacles of varying shape, size and texture. While navigating within such environments, animals need to perceive and disambiguate environmental features that might obstruct their flight. The most elemental aspect of aerial navigation through such environments is gap identification and ‘passability’ evaluation. We used bumblebees to seek insights into the mechanisms used for gap identification when confronted with an obstacle in their flight path and behavioral compensations employed to assess gap properties. Initially, bumblebee foragers were trained to fly though an unobstructed flight tunnel that led to a foraging chamber. After the bees were familiar with this situation, we placed a wall containing a gap that unexpectedly obstructed the flight path on a return trip to the hive. The flight trajectories of the bees as they approached the obstacle wall and traversed the gap were analyzed in order to evaluate their behavior as a function of the distance between the gap and a background wall that was placed behind the gap. Bumblebees initially decelerated when confronted with an unexpected obstacle. Deceleration was first noticed when the obstacle subtended around 35 deg on the retina but also depended on the properties of the gap. Subsequently, the bees gradually traded off their longitudinal velocity to lateral velocity and approached the gap with increasing lateral displacement and lateral velocity. Bumblebees shaped their flight trajectory depending on the salience of the gap, indicated in our case by the optic flow contrast between the region within the gap and on the obstacle, which decreased with decreasing distance between the gap and the background wall. As the optic flow contrast decreased, the bees spent an increasing amount of time moving laterally across the obstacles. During these repeated lateral maneuvers, the bees are probably assessing gap geometry and passability."

        "abstract": "Echolocating toothed whales generally adjust click intensity and rate according to target range to ensure that echoes from targets of interest arrive before a subsequent click is produced, presumably facilitating range estimation from the delay between clicks and returning echoes. However, this click–echo–click paradigm for the dolphin biosonar is mostly based on experiments with stationary animals echolocating fixed targets at ranges below ∼120 m. Therefore, we trained two bottlenose dolphins instrumented with a sound recording tag to approach a target from ranges up to 400 m and either touch the target (subject TRO) or detect a target orientation change (subject SAY). We show that free-swimming dolphins dynamically increase interclick interval (ICI) out to target ranges of ∼100 m. TRO consistently kept ICIs above the two-way travel time (TWTT) for target ranges shorter than ∼100 m, whereas SAY switched between clicking at ICIs above and below the TWTT for target ranges down to ∼25 m. Source levels changed on average by 17log10(target range), but with considerable variation for individual slopes (4.1 standard deviations for by-trial random effects), demonstrating that dolphins do not adopt a fixed automatic gain control matched to target range. At target ranges exceeding ∼100 m, both dolphins frequently switched to click packet production in which interpacket intervals exceeded the TWTT, but ICIs were shorter than the TWTT. We conclude that the click–echo–click paradigm is not a fixed echolocation strategy in dolphins, and we demonstrate the first use of click packets for free-swimming dolphins when solving an echolocation task."

One hypothesis is that efferent modulation of the sensory hair cells cancels self-generated noise and allows fish to sample their surroundings while swimming. In this study, microwire electrodes were chronically implanted into the anterior lateral line nerve of oyster toadfish and neural activity was monitored during forward movement. Fish were allowed to freely swim or were moved by a tethered sled. In all cases, neural activity increased during movement with no evidence of efferent modulation. The anterior lateral line of moving fish responded to a vibrating sphere or the tail oscillations of a robotic fish, indicating that the lateral line also remains sensitive to outside stimulus during self-generated movement. The results suggest that during normal swim speeds, lateral line neuromasts are not saturated and retain the ability to detect external stimuli without efferent modulation."

        "abstract": "Stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) is characterised by a rise in body temperature in response to a stressor. In endotherms, SIH is mediated by the autonomic nervous system, whereas ectotherms must raise their body temperature via behavioural means by moving to warmer areas within their environment (behavioural thermoregulation). A recent study suggested that zebrafish (Danio rerio), an important model species, may move to warmer water in response to handling and confinement and thus exhibit SIH, which, if accepted, may have important practical and welfare implications. However, an alternative hypothesis proposed that the observed movements may be produced by avoidance behaviour rather than behavioural thermoregulation. Investigating the claims for SIH in zebrafish further, we conducted two experiments that extend the earlier study. The first experiment incorporated new conditions that considered fish behaviour in the absence of thermal variation, i.e. their null distribution, an important condition that was not performed in the original study. The second was a refined version of the experiment to reduce the numbers of fish and aid movement between areas for the fish. In contrast to the previous study, we saw no effect of handling or confinement on preference for warmer areas, and no evidence for SIH in either experiment. Instead, we observed a short-lived reduction in preference for warmer areas immediately post-stress. Our work suggests that zebrafish may not experience SIH, and claims regarding fish consciousness based on SIH may need to be revised."

        "abstract": "Many animals, including zebrafish (Danio rerio), form social hierarchies through competition for limited resources. Socially subordinate fish may experience chronic stress, leading to prolonged elevation of the glucocorticoid stress hormone cortisol. As elevated cortisol levels can impair neurogenesis, the present study tested the hypothesis that social stress suppresses cell proliferation in the telencephalon of subordinate zebrafish via a cortisol-mediated mechanism. Cell proliferation was assessed using incorporation of the thymidine analogue 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU). After 48 and 96 h of social interaction, subordinate male zebrafish exhibited elevated plasma cortisol concentrations and significantly lower numbers of BrdU+ cells in the dorsal but not ventral regions of the telencephalon compared with dominant or group-housed control male fish. After a 2 week recovery in a familiar group of conspecifics, the number of BrdU+ cells that co-labelled with a neuronal marker (NeuN) was modestly reduced in previously subordinate male fish, suggesting that the reduction of cell proliferation during social stress may result in fewer cells recruited into the neuronal population. In contrast to male social hierarchies, subordinate female zebrafish did not experience elevated plasma cortisol, and the number of BrdU+ cells in the dorsal telencephalic area was comparable among dominant, subordinate and group-housed control female fish. Treating male zebrafish with metyrapone, a cortisol synthesis inhibitor, blocked the cortisol response to social subordination and attenuated the suppression of brain cell proliferation in the dorsal telencephalic area of subordinate fish. Collectively, these data support a role for cortisol in regulating adult neurogenesis in the telencephalon of male zebrafish during social stress."

In zebrafish, there are two paralogs of Hif-1α (Hif-1A and Hif-1B), but little is known about the specific roles or potential sub-functionalization of the paralogs in response to hypoxia. Using knockout lines of Hif-1α paralogs, we examined their involvement in the hypoxic ventilatory response, measured as ventilation frequency (fV) in larval and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). In wild-type zebrafish, fV increased across developmental time (4, 7, 10 and 15 days post­-fertilization, dpf) in response to hypoxia (55 mmHg). In contrast, the Hif-1B knockout fish did not exhibit an increase in hypoxic fV at 4 dpf. Similar to wild-type, as larvae of all knockout lines developed, the magnitude of fV increased but to a lesser degree than in the wild-type larvae, until 15 dpf at which point there was no difference among the genotypes. In adult zebrafish, only in Hif-1B knockout fish was there an attenuation in fV during sustained exposure to 30 mmHg for 1 h but there was no effect when fish were exposed for a shorter duration to progressive hypoxia. The mechanism of action of Hif-1α, in part, may be through its downstream target, nitric oxide synthase, and its product, nitric oxide. Overall, the effect of each Hif-1α paralog on the hypoxic ventilatory response of zebrafish varies over development and is dependent on the type of hypoxic stress."

The respiratory mechanics of juvenile caiman were additionally measured while the animals were floating in water and submerged at 30, 60 and 90 deg to the water's surface. The static compliance of the juvenile pulmonary system (2.89±0.22 ml cmH2O−1 100 g−1) was greater than that of adults (1.2±0.41 ml cmH2O−1 100 g−1), suggesting that the system stiffens as the body wall becomes more muscular and keratinized in adults. For both age groups, the lungs were much more compliant than the body wall, offering little resistance to air flow (15.35 and 4.25 ml cmH2O−1 100 g−1 for lungs, versus 3.39 and 1.67 ml cmH2O−1 100 g−1 for body wall, in juveniles and adults, respectively). Whole-system dynamic mechanics decreased with increasing ventilation frequency (fR), but was unaffected by changes in tidal volume (VT). The vast majority of the work of breathing was required to overcome elastic forces; however, work to overcome resistive forces increased proportionally with fR. Work of breathing was higher in juvenile caiman submerged in water at 90 deg because of an increase in work to overcome both elastic and flow resistive forces. The lowest power of breathing was found to occur at high fR and low VT for any given minute ventilation (V̇E) in caiman of all ages."

Although several studies have documented inter- and intraspecific theft of resources in different taxa, studies that delve into the behaviour of thieves and the factors that influence their behaviour have not been undertaken. In the current study on the primitively eusocial ant Diacamma indicum, we caught brood thieves red-handed: we observed them in the act of stealing brood and examined their behaviour. Thieves were persistent in their attempts despite facing aggression in the victim colony. Experiencing aggression or failure to steal in the previous attempt negatively impacted a thief's drive to reattempt. To avoid the risks associated with theft, successful thieves exited from victim nests about three times faster than others who were procuring brood from unguarded nests. In a series of experiments examining factors that caused thieves to increase their exit speed, we found that indirect cues of a foreign colony's presence, such as odour or the presence of foreign ants, did not induce these changes in thieves. Thus, we conclude that these ant thieves only respond to the direct threat posed by aggressive foreign ants. In this comprehensive study using behavioural experiments, we reveal the simple rules of engagement between victims and brood thieves."

To determine the extent to which GSEFLamides are conserved within the Arthropoda, we searched publicly accessible databases for genomic/transcriptomic evidence of their presence. GSEFLamides appear to be highly conserved within the Arthropoda, with the possible exception of the Insecta, in which sequence evidence was limited to the more basal orders. One crustacean in which GSEFLamides have been predicted using transcriptomics is the lobster, Homarus americanus. Expression of the previously published transcriptome-derived sequences was confirmed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR of brain and eyestalk ganglia cDNAs; mass spectral analyses confirmed the presence of all six of the predicted GSEFLamide isoforms – IGSEFLamide, MGSEFLamide, AMGSEFLamide, VMGSEFLamide, ALGSEFLamide and AVGSEFLamide – in H. americanus brain extracts. AMGSEFLamide, of which there are multiple copies in the cloned transcripts, was the most abundant isoform detected in the brain. Because the GSEFLamides are present in the lobster nervous system, we hypothesized that they might function as neuromodulators, as is common for neuropeptides. We thus asked whether AMGSEFLamide modulates the rhythmic outputs of the cardiac ganglion and the stomatogastric ganglion. Physiological recordings showed that AMGSEFLamide potently modulates the motor patterns produced by both ganglia, suggesting that the GSEFLamides may serve as important and conserved modulators of rhythmic motor activity in arthropods."

        "abstract": "Echinoderms lack a centralized nervous control system, yet each extant echinoderm class has evolved unique and effective strategies for locomotion. Brittle stars (Ophiuroidea) stride swiftly over the seafloor by coordinating motions of their five muscular arms. Their arms consist of many repeating segments, requiring them to use a complex control system to coordinate motions among segments and between arms. We conducted in vivo experiments with brittle stars to analyze the functional role of the nerve ring, which connects the nerves in each arm. These experiments were designed to determine how the ophiuroid nervous system performs complex decision making and locomotory actions under decentralized control. Our results show that brittle star arms must be connected by the nerve ring for coordinated locomotion, but information can travel bidirectionally around the nerve ring so that it circumvents the severance. Evidence presented indicates that ophiuroids rely on adjacent nerve ring connections for sustained periodic movements. The number of arms connected via the nerve ring is correlated positively with the likelihood that the animal will show coordinated locomotion, indicating that integrated nerve ring tissue is critical for control. The results of the experiments should provide a basis for the advancement of complex artificial decentralized systems."

        "link": "http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/2/jeb185702",
        "abstract": "During quadrupedal walking, most primates utilize diagonal-sequence diagonal-couplet gaits, large limb excursions and hindlimb-biased limb loading. These gait characteristics are thought to be basal to primates, but the selective pressure underlying these gait changes remains unknown. Some researchers have examined these characteristics during vertical climbing and propose that primate quadrupedal gait characteristics may have arisen due to the mechanical challenges of moving on vertical supports. Unfortunately, these studies are usually limited in scope and do not account for varying strategies based on body size or phylogeny. Here, we test the hypothesis that the spatiotemporal gait characteristics that are used during horizontal walking in primates are also present during vertical climbing irrespective of body size and phylogeny. We examined footfall patterns, diagonality, speed and stride length in eight species of primates across a range of body masses. We found that, during vertical climbing, primates slow down, keep more limbs in contact with the substrate at any one time, and increase the frequency of lateral-sequence gaits compared with horizontal walking. Taken together, these characteristics are assumed to increase stability during locomotion. Phylogenetic relatedness and body size differences have little influence on locomotor patterns observed across species. These data reject the idea that the suite of spatiotemporal gait features observed in primates during horizontal walking are in some way evolutionarily linked to selective pressures associated with mechanical requirements of vertical climbing. These results also highlight the importance of behavioral flexibility for negotiating the challenges of locomotion in an arboreal environment."

        "abstract": "Amphibious fishes have evolved multiple adaptive strategies for respiring out of water, but there has been less focus on reversible plasticity. We tested the hypothesis that when amphibious fishes leave water, enhanced respiratory performance on land is the result of rapid functional phenotypic flexibility of respiratory traits. We acclimated four isogenic strains of Kryptolebias marmoratus to air for 0, 1, 3 or 7 days. We compared respiratory performance out of water with traits linked to the O2 cascade. Aerial O2 consumption rate was measured over a step-wise decrease in O2 levels. There were significant differences between strains, but time out of water had the largest impact on measured parameters. Kryptolebias marmoratus had improved respiratory performance [lower aerial critical oxygen tension (Pcrit), higher regulation index (RI)] after only 1 day of air exposure, and these changes were strongly associated with the change in hematocrit and dorsal cutaneous angiogenesis. Additionally, we found that 1 h of air exposure induced the expression of four angiogenesis-associated genes – vegfa, angpt2, pecam-1 and efna1 – in the skin. After 7 days in air, respiratory traits were not significantly linked to the variation in either aerial Pcrit or RI. Overall, our data indicate that there are two phases involved in the enhancement of aerial respiration: an initial rapid response (1 day) and a delayed response (7 days). We found evidence for the hypothesis that respiratory performance on land in amphibious fishes is the result of rapid flexibility in both O2 uptake and O2 carrying capacity."

        "abstract": "Muscle contractile mechanics induced by the changing demands of human movement have the potential to influence our movement strategies. This study examined fascicle length changes of the triceps surae during jumping with added mass or increasing jump height to determine whether the chosen movement strategies were associated with relevant changes in muscle contractile properties. Sixteen participants jumped at sub-maximal and maximal intensities while total net work was matched via two distinct paradigms: (1) adding mass to the participant or (2) increasing jump height. Electromyography (EMG) and ultrasound analyses were performed to examine muscle activation, fascicle length and fascicle velocity changes of the triceps surae during jumping. Integrated EMG was significantly higher in the added mass paradigm with no difference in mean or maximal EMG, indicating that the muscle was activated for a significantly longer period of time but not activated to a greater intensity. Fascicle shortening velocity was slower with added mass compared than with increasing jump height; therefore, intrinsic force–velocity properties probably enabled increased force production. Improved fascicle contractile mechanics paired with a longer activation period probably produced a consistently larger fascicle force, enabling a greater impulse about the ankle joint. This may explain why previous research found that participants used an ankle-centred strategy for work production in the added mass paradigm and not in the jump height paradigm. The varied architecture of muscles within the lower limb may influence which muscles we choose to employ for work production under different task constraints."

We have used a previously developed methodology focused on the detailed mathematical description of head compensatory movements in frogs without the need for any surgical procedures on the examined specimens. Our comparative study comprising 35 species of frogs from different phylogenetic backgrounds revealed species-specific head compensatory abilities ensuring gaze stabilization. Moreover, we found a strong phylogenetic signal highlighting the great ability of compensatory head movements in families of Pyxicephalidae and Rhacophoridae from the Natatanura group. By contrast, families of Dendrobatidae and Microhylidae exhibited only poor or no head compensatory movements. Contrary to our expectation, the results did not corroborate an ecomorphological hypothesis anticipating a close relationship between ecological parameters and the head compensatory movements. We did not find any positive association between more complex (3D structured, arboreal or aquatic) habitats or more saltatory behavior and elevated abilities of head compensatory movements. Moreover, we found compensatory movements in most basal Archeobatrachia, giving an indication of common ancestry of these abilities in frogs that are variously pronounced in particular families. We hypothesize that the uncovered proper gaze stabilization during locomotion provided by the higher head compensatory abilities can improve or even enable visual perception of the prey. We interpret this completely novel finding as a possible gyroscopic advantage in a foraging context. We discuss putative consequences of such advanced neuromotor skills for diversification and ecological success of the Natatanura group."

        "abstract": "Analysis of the kinematics of take-off in the planthopper Proutista moesta (Hemiptera, Fulgoroidea, family Derbidae) from high-speed videos showed that these insects used two distinct mechanisms involving different appendages. The first was a fast take-off (55.7% of 106 take-offs by 11 insects) propelled by a synchronised movement of the two hind legs and without participation of the wings. The body was accelerated in 1 ms or less to a mean take-off velocity of 1.7 m s−1 while experiencing average forces of more than 150 times gravity. The power required from the leg muscles implicated a power-amplification mechanism. Such take-offs propelled the insect along its trajectory a mean distance of 7.9 mm in the first 5 ms after take-off. The second and slower take-off mechanism (44.3% of take-offs) was powered by beating movements of the wings alone, with no discernible contribution from the hind legs. The resulting mean acceleration time was 16 times slower at 17.3 ms, the mean final velocity was six times lower at 0.27 m s−1, the g forces experienced were 80 times lower and the distance moved in 5 ms after take-off was 7 times shorter. The power requirements could be readily met by direct muscle contraction. The results suggest a testable hypothesis that the two mechanisms serve distinct behavioural actions: the fast take-offs could enable escape from predators and the slow take-offs that exert much lower ground reaction forces could enable take-off from more flexible substrates while also displacing the insect in a slower and more controllable trajectory."

In this study, we examined the stride parameters and ground reaction forces from three adult giraffes in a zoological park, across a range of walking speeds. The patterns of GRFs during walking indicate that giraffes, similar to other mammalian quadrupeds, maintain a forelimb-biased weight distribution. The angular excursion of the neck has functional links with locomotor dynamics in giraffes, and was exaggerated at faster speeds. The horizontal accelerations of the neck and trunk were out of phase compared with the vertical accelerations, which were intermediate between in and out of phase. Despite possessing specialised morphology, giraffes' stride parameters were broadly predicted from dynamic similarity, facilitating the use of other quadrupedal locomotion models to generate testable hypotheses in giraffes."

        "abstract": "Behaviour is often a front line response to changing environments. Recent studies show behavioural changes are associated with changes of gene expression; however, these studies have primarily focused on discrete behavioural states. We build on these studies by addressing additional contexts that produce qualitatively similar behavioural changes. We measured levels of gene expression and cytosine methylation, which is hypothesized to regulate the transcriptional architecture of behavioural transitions, within the brain during male parental care of the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides in a factorial design. Male parenting is a suitably plastic behaviour because although male N. vespilloides typically do not provide direct care (i.e. feed offspring) when females are present, levels of feeding by a male equivalent to the female can be induced by removing the female. We examined three different factors: behavioural state (caring versus non-caring), social context (with or without a female mate) and individual flexibility (if a male switched to direct care after his mate was removed). The greatest number of differentially expressed genes were associated with behavioural state, followed by social context and individual flexibility. Cytosine methylation was not associated with changes of gene expression in any of the factors. Our results suggest a hierarchical association between gene expression and the different factors, but that this process is not controlled by cytosine methylation. Our results further suggest that the extent a behaviour is transient plays an underappreciated role in determining its underpinning molecular mechanisms."

        "abstract": "Birds often accumulate large fat and protein reserves to fuel long-distance flights. While it is well known that species that fly the longest accumulate the largest amounts of fuel, considerable cross-species variation in fuel load is seen after controlling for overall migration distance. It remains unclear whether this variation can be explained by aerodynamic attributes of different species, despite obvious ecological and conservation implications. Here, we collected data on wing morphology, flight type, migration distance and fuel load from 213 European bird species and explored three questions: (1) does maximum fuel load relate to migration distance across species?; (2) does wing morphology, as described by wing aspect ratio and wing loading, influence maximum fuel load?; and (3) does flight type influence maximum fuel load? Our results indicate that maximum fuel load increases with migration across species, but residual variance is high. The latter variance is explained by aspect ratio and flight type, while wing loading and body mass explain little variance. Birds with slender wings accumulate less fuel than species with low wing aspect ratio when covering a similar migration distance. Continuously flapping species accumulate the largest amounts of fuel, followed by flapping and soaring species and flapping and gliding species, while the smallest fuel loads were observed in birds with passerine-type flight. These results highlight complex eco-evolutionary adaptations to migratory behaviour, pointing toward the importance of energy minimisation."

        "abstract": "Visual objects can be discriminated by static spatial features such as luminance or dynamic features such as relative movement. Flies track a solid dark vertical bar moving on a bright background, a behavioral reaction so strong that for a rigidly tethered fly, the steering trajectory is phase advanced relative to the moving bar, apparently in anticipation of its future position. By contrast, flickering bars that generate no coherent motion or have a surface texture that moves in the direction opposite to the bar generate steering responses that lag behind the stimulus. It remains unclear how the spatial properties of a bar influence behavioral response dynamics. Here,  we show that a dark bar defined by its luminance contrast to the uniform background drives a co-directional steering response that is phase advanced relative to the response to a textured bar defined only by its motion relative to a stationary textured background. The textured bar drives an initial contra-directional turn and phase-locked tracking. The qualitatively distinct response dynamics could indicate parallel visual processing of a luminance versus motion-defined object. Calcium imaging shows that T4/T5 motion-detecting neurons are more responsive to a solid dark bar than a motion-defined bar. Genetically blocking T4/T5 neurons eliminates the phase-advanced co-directional response to the luminance-defined bar, leaving the orientation response largely intact. We conclude that T4/T5 neurons mediate a co-directional optomotor response to a luminance-defined bar, thereby driving phase-advanced wing kinematics, whereas separate unknown visual pathways elicit the contra-directional orientation response."

Here, we identify novel genes in the zebrafish genome that are expressed in the zebrafish retina. We further resolve the expression pattern over time and tentatively assign specific novel transcripts to retinal bipolar cells of the inner nuclear layer. Using chemical ablation and free run experiments, we segregate the transcripts that are rhythmic when entrained by light from those that show sustained oscillations in the absence of external cues. The transcripts reported here with rigorous annotation and specific functions in circadian biology provide the groundwork for functional characterization of novel players in the zebrafish retinal clock."

Ground reaction forces were measured in several expert parkour athletes and centre of mass trajectory was calculated from force plates embedded in the ground and the wall. Empirical measures were compared with movements predicted by a work-based control optimization model. The model captured the fundamental dynamics of the transition and therefore allowed an exploration of parameter sensitivity for success at the manoeuvre (run-up speed, foot placement, etc.). The optimal transition of both the model and the parkour athletes used a common intermediate run-up speed and appears determined largely by a trade-off between positive and negative leg work that accomplishes the task with minimum overall work."

        "abstract": "The effect of previous exposure to lateral sensory stimuli in shaping the response to subsequent symmetric stimuli represents an important overlooked issue in neuroethology, with special reference to arthropods. In this research, we investigated the hypothesis to ‘programme’ jumping escape direction as well as surveillance orientation in young and adult individuals of Locusta migratoria as an adaptive consequence of prior exposure to directional-biased predator approaches generated by a robotic leopard gecko representing Eublepharis macularius. The manipulation of the jumping escape direction was successfully achieved in young locusts, although young L. migratoria did not exhibit innately lateralized jumping escapes. Jumping escape direction was also successfully manipulated in adult locusts, which exhibited innate lateralized jumping escape at the individual level. The innate lateralization of each instar of L. migratoria in using a preferential eye during surveillance was not affected by prior lateralized exposure to the robotic gecko. Our results indicate a high plasticity of the escape motor outputs that are occurring almost in real time with the perceived stimuli, making them greatly adaptable and compliant to environmental changes in order to be effective and reliable. In addition, surveillance lateralization innately occurs at population level in each instar of L. migratoria. Therefore, its low forgeability by environmental factors would avoid disorganization at swarm level and improve swarm coordination during group tasks. These findings are consistent with the fact that, as in vertebrates, in insects the right hemisphere is specialized in controlling fear and escape functions."

Common European cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, show states of quiescence during which they meet the last two of these three criteria, yet also show spontaneous bursts of arm and eye movements that accompany rapid changes in chromatophore patterns in the skin. Here, we report that this rapid eye movement sleep-like (REMS-like) state is cyclic in nature. Iterations of the REMS-like state last 2.42±0.22 min (mean±s.e.m.) and alternate with 34.01±1.49 min of the quiescent sleep-like state for durations lasting 176.89±36.71 min. We found clear evidence that this REMS-like state (i) occurs in animals younger than previously reported; (ii) follows an ultradian pattern; (iii) includes intermittent dynamic chromatophore patterning, representing fragments of normal patterning seen in the waking state for a wide range of signaling and camouflage; and (iv) shows variability in the intensity of expression of these skin patterns between and within individuals. These data suggest that cephalopods, which are mollusks with an elaborate brain and complex behavior, possess a sleep-like state that resembles behaviorally the vertebrate REM sleep state, although the exact nature and mechanism of this form of sleep may differ from that of vertebrates."

However, our understanding of animal colour perception is largely derived from human psychophysics, and behavioural tests of non-human animals are required to understand how colour signals are perceived. Here, we introduce a novel test of colour vision in animals inspired by the Ishihara colour charts, which are widely used to identify human colour deficiencies. In our method, distractor dots have a fixed chromaticity (hue and saturation) but vary in luminance. Animals can be trained to find single target dots that differ from distractor dots in chromaticity. We provide MATLAB code for creating these stimuli, which can be modified for use with different animals. We demonstrate the success of this method with triggerfish, Rhinecanthus aculeatus, which quickly learnt to select target dots that differed from distractor dots, and highlight behavioural parameters that can be measured, including success of finding the target dot, time to detection and error rate. We calculated discrimination thresholds by testing whether target colours that were of increasing colour distances (ΔS) from distractor dots could be detected, and calculated discrimination thresholds in different directions of colour space. At least for some colours, thresholds indicated better discrimination than expected from the receptor noise limited (RNL) model assuming 5% Weber fraction for the long-wavelength cone. This methodology could be used with other animals to address questions such as luminance thresholds, sensory bias, effects of sensory noise, colour categorization and saliency."

Using female caste dimorphism in bumblebees, we assessed how body mass impacts morphological and physiological traits linked with flight. The allometric relationships obtained for wing surface area, wingbeat frequency, and flight and resting metabolic rates of workers could predict the trait values of queens that were more than fourfold larger. Flight success of queens decreased over time in part because of a large increase in body mass and a decrease in traits linked with flight, namely wingbeat frequency and metabolic rate, and the activity of metabolic enzymes tended to decrease. After taking into account temporal changes, body mass, flight wingbeat frequency and metabolic rate were repeatable. Finally, we found significant family resemblance for all traits measured, indicating that shared genes and/or environmental effects impact phenotypic variation. Together, our results show that the functional association between body morphology and flight physiology is robust, providing further insights into the mechanistic basis of metabolic rate scaling patterns during locomotion in animals."

        "abstract": "Parasites alter their host behaviour and vice versa as a result of mutual adaptations in the evolutionary arms race. One of these adaptations involves changes in host thermoregulation, which has the potential to harm the parasite and thereby act as a defence mechanism. We used a model of the brown trout (Salmo trutta) experimentally parasitised with glochidia ectoparasitic larvae from the endangered freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) to reveal whether parasitisation alters fish behavioural thermoregulation. A study using radiotelemetry temperature sensors was performed during almost one year of the M. margaritifera parasitic stage. Glochidia-infested S. trutta altered their thermoregulation through active searching for habitats with different thermal regimes. The general preference for temperatures in infested fish varied and was either above or below the temperature preferred by uninfested individuals. Infested fish also preferred different temperatures across localities, whereas uninfested fish maintained their thermal preference no matter which stream they inhabited. Glochidia further induced the expression of a behavioural syndrome among S. trutta personality traits, suggesting that it might increase the probability that the fish host would occur in the glochidia temperature optimum. Our findings present the first evidence that thermoregulation plays a fundamental role in the relationship of affiliated mussels and their fish hosts. Incorporating thermoregulation as a factor in the study of this relationship can help to interpret results from previous behavioural studies, as well as to optimise management measures related to endangered mussels."

        "abstract": "For many oviparous animals, incubation temperature influences sex through temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Although climate change may skew sex ratios in species with TSD, few available methods predict sex under natural conditions, fewer still are based on mechanistic hypotheses of development, and field tests of existing methods are rare. We propose a new approach that calculates the probability of masculinization (PM) in natural nests. This approach subsumes the mechanistic hypotheses describing the outcome of TSD, by integrating embryonic development with the temperature-dependent reaction norm for sex determination. Further, we modify a commonly used method of sex ratio estimation, the constant temperature equivalent (CTE), to provide quantitative estimates of sex ratios. We test our new approaches using snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina). We experimentally manipulated nests in the field, and found that the PM method is better supported than the modified CTE, explaining 69% of the variation in sex ratios across 27 semi-natural nests. Next, we used the PM method to predict variation in sex ratios across 14 natural nests over 2 years, explaining 67% of the variation. We suggest that the PM approach is effective and broadly applicable to species with TSD, particularly for forecasting how sex ratios may respond to climate change. Interestingly, we also found that the modified CTE explained up to 64% of variation in sex ratios in a Type II TSD species, suggesting that our modifications will be useful for future research. Finally, our data suggest that the Algonquin Park population of snapping turtles possesses resilience to biased sex ratios under climate change."

Under these stressors, their ability to survive depends upon existing phenotypic plasticity, but also transgenerational adaptation. Parental effects are ubiquitous in nature, yet empirical studies of these effects in corals are scarce, particularly in the context of climate change. This study exposed mature colonies of the common reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata from the Gulf of Aqaba to seawater conditions likely to occur just beyond the end of this century during the peak planulae brooding season (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5: pH −0.4 and +5°C beyond present day). Parent and planulae physiology were assessed at multiple time points during the experimental incubation. After 5 weeks of incubation, the physiology of the parent colonies exhibited limited treatment-induced changes. All significant time-dependent changes in physiology occurred in both ambient and treatment conditions. Planulae were also resistant to future ocean conditions, with protein content, symbiont density, photochemistry, survival and settlement success not significantly different compared with under ambient conditions. High variability in offspring physiology was independent of parental or offspring treatments and indicate the use of a bet-hedging strategy in this population. This study thus demonstrates weak climate-change-associated carryover effects. Furthermore, planulae display temperature and pH resistance similar to those of adult colonies and therefore do not represent a larger future population size bottleneck. The findings add support to the emerging hypothesis that the Gulf of Aqaba may serve as a coral climate change refugium aided by these corals' inherent broad physiological resistance."

Older insects, in contrast, were only capable of repairing to ∼70% of their original strength. Both older and younger insects carry out targeted deposition to repair injuries. We also examined different mechanisms of failure, and we discovered that the cuticle of older insects is more susceptible to crack growth due to a large decrease in fracture toughness with age, making them more sensitive to scalpel cuts and punctures. The biological mechanisms that drive these changes are still under investigation."

Using a novel polarization projection system, we recently demonstrated that P. xuthus can detect visual motion based on polarization contrast. In the present study, we attempt to infer via behavioural experiments the mechanism underlying this polarization-based motion vision. Papilio xuthus do not perceive contrast between unpolarized and diagonally polarized light, implying that they cannot unambiguously estimate angle and degree of polarization, at least as far as motion detection is concerned. Furthermore, they conflate brightness and polarization cues, such that bright vertically polarized light resembles dim unpolarized light. These observations are consistent with a one-channel ‘monopolatic’ detector mechanism. We extend our existing model of motion vision in P. xuthus to incorporate these polarization findings, and conclude that the photoreceptors likely to form the basis for the putative monopolatic polarization detector are R3 and R4, which respond maximally to horizontally polarized green light. R5–R8, we propose, form a polarization-insensitive secondary channel tuned to longer wavelengths of light. Consistent with this account, we see greater sensitivity to polarization for green-light stimuli than for subjectively equiluminant red ones. Somewhat counter-intuitively, our model predicts greatest sensitivity to vertically polarized light; owing to the non-linearity of photoreceptor responses, light polarized to an angle orthogonal to a monopolatic detector's orientation offers the greatest contrast with unpolarized light."

        "abstract": "TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates transcription, translation and alternative splicing of mRNA. We have shown previously that null mutations of the Drosophila ortholog, Tar DNA-binding homolog (tbph), causes severe locomotion defects in larvae that are mediated by a reduction in the expression of a type II voltage-gated calcium channel, cacophony (cac). We also showed that TDP-43 regulates the inclusion of alternatively spliced exons of cacophony; tbph mutants showed significantly increased expression of cacophony isoforms lacking exon 7, a particularly notable finding as only one out of the 15 predicted isoforms lacks exon 7. To investigate the function of exon 7, we generated Drosophila mutant lines with a deletion that eliminates exon 7. This deletion phenocopies many defects in tbph mutants: a reduction in cacophony protein (Dmca1A) expression, locomotion defects in male and female third instar larvae, disrupted larval motor output, and also reduced activity levels in adult male flies. All these defects were rescued by expression of cacophony transcripts containing exon 7. By contrast, expression of a cacophony cDNA lacking exon 7 resulted in reduced cacophony protein levels and failed to rescue larval locomotion."
