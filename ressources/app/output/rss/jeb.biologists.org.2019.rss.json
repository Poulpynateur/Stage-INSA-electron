[{"abstract":"The hypothalamus controls metabolism and feeding behavior via several signals with other tissues. Exercise and supplements can change hypothalamic signaling pathways, so the present study investigated the influence of eccentric resistance training and β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate free acid supplement on PGC-1α expression, serum irisin, nesfatin-1 and resistin concentrations. Thirty-two male rats (8 weeks old, 200±17 g body mass) were randomized to control (CON), β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate free acid (HMB) supplementation, eccentric resistance training (ERT), and β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate free acid supplementation plus eccentric resistance training (HMB+ERT) groups. Training groups undertook eccentric resistance training (6 weeks, 3 times a week) and supplement groups consumed HMB-FA orally (76 mg/kg/day). Twenty-four hours after the last training session, rats were sacrificed after which serum and triceps brachii muscle were collected and sent to the laboratory for analyses. Two-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation were employed (significant level: P< 0.05). The results showed that eccentric resistance training increases skeletal muscle PGC-1α gene expression, as well as serum levels of irisin and nesfatin-1 (P= 0.001). Eccentric resistance training decreases serum concentration of resistin (P= 0.001). HMB-FA supplement increases skeletal muscle PGC-1α gene expression (P= 0.002), as well as serum concentartion of irisin and nesfatin-1 (P= 0.001). HMB-FA decreases the serum concentration of resistin (P= 0.001). Significant correlations were observed between PGC-1α gene expression and serum concentrations of irisin, nesfatin-1 and resistin. Generally, HMB-FA with eccentric resistance training may induce crosstalk between releasing peptides from other tissues and increases maximal strength. Their combination had a more substantial effect than each intervention in isolation.","keywords":"Exercise, HMB supplement, Maximal strength, PGC-1α signaling pathway, Resistance training, Tissue crosstalk","title":"Eccentric resistance training and β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate free acid affects muscle PGC-1α expression and serum irisin, nesfatin-1 and resistin","authors":"Hossein Shirvani, Saleh Rahmati-Ahmadabad, David Robert Broom, Reza Mirnejad","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"13 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.198424v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Biologists commonly visualize different features of an organism using distinct sources of illumination. Multichannel imaging has largely not been applied to behavioral studies due to the challenges posed by a moving subject. We address this challenge with the technique of Multichannel Stroboscopic Videography (MSV), which synchronizes multiple strobe lights with video exposures of a single camera. We illustrate the utility of this approach with kinematic measurements of a walking cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and calculations of the pressure field around a swimming fish (Danio rerio). In both, transmitted illumination generated high-contrast images of the animal's body in one channel. Other sources of illumination were used to visualize the points of contact for the feet of the cockroach and water flow around the fish in separate channels. MSV provides an enhanced potential for high-throughput experimentation and the capacity to integrate changes in physiological or environmental conditions in freely-behaving animals.","keywords":"Animal behavior, Computer vision, Multichannel visualization, Kinematics, Particle image velocimetry, Biomechanics","title":"Multichannel Stroboscopic Videography (MSV): A technique for visualizing multiple channels for behavioral measurements","authors":"Alberto P.

This study investigated how goats adjust the stiffness of their hindlimbs to accommodate surfaces of different stiffness. Goats provide a compelling animal model for studying leg stiffness modulation, because they skillfully ambulate over a range of substrates that vary in compliance. To investigate the adjustments that goats make when walking over such substrates, ground reaction forces and three-dimensional trajectories of hindlimb markers were recorded as goats walked on rigid, rubber, and foam surfaces. Net joint moments, powers, and work at the hip, knee, ankle and metatarsophalangeal joints were estimated throughout stance via inverse dynamics. Hindlimb stiffness was estimated from plots of total leg force versus total leg length, and individual joint stiffnesses were estimated from plots of joint moment versus joint angle. Our results support the hypothesis that goats modulate hindlimb stiffness in response to surface stiffness; specifically, hindlimb stiffness decreased on the more compliant surfaces (p<0.002). Estimates of joint stiffness identified hip and ankle muscles as the primary drivers of these adjustments. When humans run on compliant surfaces, they generally increase leg stiffness to preserve their center-of-mass mechanics. We did not estimate center-of-mass mechanics in this study; nevertheless, our estimates of hindlimb stiffness suggest that goats exhibit a different behavior. This study offers new insight into mechanisms that allow quadrupeds to modulate their gait mechanics when walking on surfaces of variable compliance.","keywords":"Locomotion, Quadruped, Biomechanics, Inverse dynamics, Leg stiffness, Joint stiffness","title":"Goats decrease hindlimb stiffness when walking over compliant surfaces","authors":"Tyler R.

Food-derived odorants are generally involved in mediating long-and short-range attraction. Taste cues, on the other hand, act directly by contact with the food source, promoting the ingestion of nutritious food and the avoidance of toxic substances. It is possible, however, that insects integrate information from these sensory modalities during the process of feeding itself. Here, using a simple feeding assay, we investigated whether odors modulate food consumption in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We found that the presence of both single food-derived odorants and complex odor mixtures enhanced consumption of an appetitive food. Feeding enhancement depended on the concentration and the chemical identity of the odorant. Volatile cues alone were sufficient to mediate this effect, as feeding was also increased when animals were prevented from contacting the odor source. Both males and females, including virgin females, increased ingestion in the presence of food-derived volatiles. Moreover, the presence of food-derived odorants significantly increased the consumption of food mixtures containing aversive bitter compounds, suggesting that flies integrate diverse olfactory and gustatory cues to guide feeding decisions, including in situations in which animals are confronted with stimuli of opposite valence. Overall, these results show that food-derived olfactory cues directly modulate feeding in D. melanogaster, enhancing ingestion.","keywords":"Olfaction, Feeding, Fruit fly, Sensory integration, Taste, Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila melanogaster","title":"Food-derived volatiles enhance consumption in Drosophila melanogaster","authors":"Carolina E.

However, wing gaps inherent of this process can also reduce flight capacities, which could be detrimental when foraging or escaping predators. Still, many bird species will not stop their normal activities when molting. In this study, we investigated whether and how birds adjust their escape flight behavior to compensate for the reduction in performance when flying with wing gaps. Using stereoscopic high-speed videography, we filmed 146 upward-directed escape flights of 19 and 22 pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) with and without simulated molt gaps, respectively. We then reconstructed the three-dimensional body and wing movements throughout each maneuver. By comparing flights with and without gaps, we determined how wing molt gaps affected wing morphology, escape flight performance, and how the birds adjusted their flight kinematics in order to negate possible negative aerodynamic effects. Our manipulations resulted in a lower second-moment-of-area of the wings, but flight speed and net aerodynamic force production did not differ between the two groups. We found that in manipulated birds, the size of the gap was reduced as the flight feathers adjacent to the gap had moved towards each other. Moreover, the experimental decrease in second-moment-of-area was associated with an increase in angle-of-attack, whereas changes in wingbeat-induced speeds were associated with variations in aerodynamic force production. This suggests that the control of escape flight in molting birds might be modular, allowing relatively simple flight control, thus reducing the burden on the neuro-muscular flight control system.","keywords":"European pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, Ficedula hypoleuca, Avian flight, Wingbeat kinematics","title":"A songbird compensates for wing molt during escape flights by reducing the molt gap and increasing angle-of-attack","authors":"Barbara M.

The command for each EOD arises from a medullary pacemaker nucleus composed by electrotonically coupled intrinsic pacemaker and bulbospinal projecting relay cells. During agonistic encounters Gymnotus omarorum signals submission by interrupting its EOD (offs) and by emitting transient high rate barrages of low amplitude discharges (chirps). Previous studies in gymnotiformes have shown that electric signal diversity is based on the segregation of descending synaptic inputs to pacemaker or relay cells and differential activation of the neurotransmitter receptors -for glutamate or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- of these cells. Therefore, we tested whether GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs to pacemaker nucleus neurons are involved in the emission of submissive electric signals in G. omarorum. We found that GABA applied to pacemaker cells evokes EOD interruptions that closely resembled natural offs. Although in other species chirping is likely due to glutamatergic suprathreshold depolarization of relay cells, here, application of glutamate to these cells was unable to replicate the emission of this submissive signal. Nevertheless, chirp-like discharges were emitted after the enhancement of excitability of relay cells by blocking an IA-type potassium current and, in some cases, by application of vasotocin, a status-dependent modulator peptide of G. omarorum agonistic behavior. Modulation of electrophysiological properties of pacemaker nucleus neurons in gymnotiformes emerges as a novel putative mechanism, endowing electromotor networks with higher functional versatility.","keywords":"Glutamate, GABA, Neuromodulation, Neuronal excitability, Electric fish, Pacemaker nucleus, Electric communication, Agonistic behavior, Social signals, Gymnotus omarorum, Gymnotus omarorum","title":"Distinctive mechanisms underlie the emission of social electric signals of submission in Gymnotus omarorum","authors":"Virginia Comas, Kim Langevin, Ana Silva, Michel Borde","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"13 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.195354v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Thermal performance curves (TPCs) are intended to approximate the relationship between temperature and fitness, and are commonly integrated into species distributional models for understanding climate change responses. However, TPCs may vary across traits because selection and environmental sensitivity (plasticity) differ across traits or because the timing and duration of the temperature exposure, here termed time-scale, may alter trait variation. Yet the extent to which TPCs vary temporally and across traits is rarely considered in assessments of climate change responses. Using a common garden approach, we estimate TPCs for standard metabolic rate (SMR), and activity in Drosophila melanogaster at three test temperatures (16, 25 and 30 °C), using flies from each of six developmental temperatures (16, 18, 20, 25, 28 and 30 °C). We examined the effects of time-scale of temperature exposure (mins/hours vs days/weeks) in altering the TPC shape, position and commonly used descriptors of the TPC- thermal optimum (TOPT), thermal limits (TMIN and TMAX) and thermal breadth (TBR). In addition we collated previously published estimates of TPCs for fecundity and egg-to-adult viability in D. melanogaster. We found that the descriptors of the TPCs varied across traits (egg-to-adult viability, SMR, activity and fecundity), but variation in TPCs within these traits was small across studies when measured at the same time-scales. The time-scale at which traits were measured contributed to greater variation in TPCs than the observed variance across traits, although the relative importance of time-scale differed depending on the trait (activity vs fecundity). Variation in the TPC across traits and time-scales suggests that TPCs using single traits may not be an accurate predictor of fitness and thermal adaptation across environments.","keywords":"Thermal performance curve, Metabolic rate, Activity, Fecundity, Egg-to-adult viability, Plasticity","title":"Comparing thermal performance curves across traits: how consistent are they?","authors":"Vanessa Kellermann, Steven L.

In mammals, SELENOT is expressed during ontogenesis and progressively decreases in adult tissues. In the heart, it is re-expressed after ischemia and induces cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. SELENOT is present in teleost fish, including the goldfish Carassius auratus. This study aimed to evaluate the cardiac expression of SELENOT, and the effects of exogenous PSELT (a 43-52 SELENOT derived-peptide) on the heart function of C. auratus, a hypoxia tolerance fish model. We found that SELENOT was expressed in cardiac extracts of juvenile and adult fish, located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) together with calsequestrin-2. Expression increased under acute hypoxia. On ex vivo isolated and perfused goldfish heart preparations, under normoxia, PSELT dose-dependently increased Stroke Volume (SV), Cardiac Output (Q̇), and Stroke Work (SW), by involving cAMP, PKA, L-type calcium channels, SERCA2a pumps, and pAkt. Under hypoxia, PSELT did not affect myocardial contractility. Only at higher concentrations (10−8 -10−7 M) an increase of SV and Q̇ was observed. It also reduced the cardiac expression of 3-NT, a tissue marker of nitrosative stress which increases under low oxygen availability. These data are the first to propose SELENOT 43-52, PSELT, as a cardiac modulator in fish, with a potential protective role under hypoxia.","keywords":"Selenoprotein-T, Carassius auratus, Carassius auratus, Heart, Hypoxia, Intracellular calcium, Redox balance","title":"Selenoprotein T as a new positive inotrope in the goldfish Carassius auratus","authors":"Mazza Rosa, Gattuso Alfonsina, Imbrogno Sandra, Boukhzar Loubna, Leo Serena, Mallouki Ben Yamine, Filice Mariacristina, Rocca Carmine, Angelone Tommaso, Anouar Youssef, Cerra Maria Carmela","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"13 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.201202v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Nocturnal ants forage and navigate during periods of reduced light, making detection of visual cues difficult, yet they are skilled visual navigators. These foragers retain visual panoramic memories both around the nest and along known routes for later use, be it to return to previously visited food sites or to the nest. Here, we explore the navigational knowledge of the nocturnal bull ant, Myrmecia midas, by investigating differences in nest-ward homing after displacement of three forager groups based on similarities in the panoramas between the release site and previously visited locations. Foragers that travel straight up the foraging tree or to close trees around the nest show reduced navigational success in orienting and returning from displacements compared to individuals that forage further from the nest site. By analysing the cues present in the panorama, we show that multiple metrics of forager navigational performance correspond with the degree of similarity between the release site panorama and panoramas of previously visited sites. In highly cluttered environments, where panoramas change rapidly over short distances, the views acquired near the nest are only useful over a small area and memories acquired along foraging routes become critical.","keywords":"Visual navigation, Panorama, Orientation, Off-route, Cluttered environments","title":"Panorama similarity and navigational knowledge in the nocturnal bull ant, Myrmicia midas","authors":"Cody A.

Furthermore, inactive cells with cytoplasmic VHA had large glycogen stores and active cells with basolateral VHA had depleted glycogen stores.

Corticosteroid receptor (CR) pharmacological blocker studies have suggested that to produce this tightening effect, cortisol acts on the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) as well as glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). This study considered how cortisol influenced model gill epithelium permeability and TJ properties by transcriptional knockdown of the gene encoding MR (mr-KD) using double-stranded RNA. Following mr-KD a significant reduction in MR protein abundance was observed in the epithelium. The mr-KD epithelium demonstrated reduced transepithelial resistance (TER) and increased the paracellular flux of [3H] polyethylene glycol (MW 400 kDa, PEG-400). Concurrently, mRNA abundance of gr2 and 11βhsd increased, indicating a possible compensatory response to mr-KD. Transcript abundance of claudin (cldn) -6, -8d, 23a and -28b decreased while cldn-20a increased in mr-KD preparations. Cortisol-induced epithelial tightening was enhanced in mr-KD preparations, suggesting that alterations in CRs and TJ composition augmented model epithelium barrier function in response to lowered MR abundance. Cortisol treatment significantly increased the transcript and protein abundance of TJ proteins such as cldn/Cldn -8d, and -28b. However, in mr-KD preparations, Cldn-28b protein abundance did not significantly alter in response to cortisol treatment, while Cldn-8d significantly elevated. Data suggest that mr-KD compromises normal barrier function of a primary cultured rainbow trout gill epithelium both in the presence and absence of cortisol and that Cldn-28b protein abundance may be modulated by cortisol via the MR only.","keywords":"Tight junction, Paracellular permeability, Cortisol, Mineralocorticoid receptor, Osmoregulation, Knockdown","title":"The mineralocorticoid receptor contributes to barrier function of a model fish gill epithelium","authors":"Dennis Kolosov, Scott P.
