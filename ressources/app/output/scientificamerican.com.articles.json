[{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/environmental-thinker-bill-mckibben-sounds-warning-on-technology/","authors":"Annie Sneed","pub_date":"April 15, 2019","abstract":"When author and environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote The End of Nature in 1989, the world was a very different place. The science behind climate change was not as sophisticated, the public’s understanding of the issue more limited, and the real-world effects of global warming far less obvious to the average person.\n\nThirty years and more than a degree Celsius of warming later, humanity has yet to seriously deal with the planet’s climate problem. Heat-trapping greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere, and the U.S. government has failed to take meaningful action to curb them. And in addition to climate change, McKibben now sees two other existential threats facing humanity: artificial intelligence and human genetic engineering. He writes about these issues in his new book, Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out? \n\nScientific American spoke with McKibben, founder of the climate change organization 350.org, about the motivation behind his book, why he believes these problems are so perilous, and how humankind might address its self-created crises.\n\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\n\nWhat is different, in terms of climate change, since you wrote The End of Nature in 1989? \n\nIn 1989 there was still something somewhat abstract about the threat [of climate change]. We knew it was coming, the science was clear, but you couldn't yet take a picture of it. Thirty years later it's the dominant fact of daily life for hundreds of millions of people every day around the world who are dealing with some flood, drought, wildfire or the steady rise of the oceans—all the things we've unleashed. So it is a very different situation in that way. It is real now.\n\nYou draw attention to what you call two other existential threats to humanity—artificial intelligence and human germline genetic engineering. Why do you think these three issues are the most alarming? \n\nThese are the other things that potentially shift what we've understood to be our place on this planet. Just as climate change dramatically undermines nature, so these shifts dramatically challenge human nature.\n\nFor artificial intelligence, people have speculated about all kinds of disaster scenarios. Maybe they're true, maybe they're not. But even if AI works as it's supposed to, the inevitable result will be the supplanting of human beings as the measure of meaning in the world. And to what end? So that we can make things happen more quickly? Why do we want that? What is the point? It seems to me that those are the questions we haven't even begun to ask.\n\nThere are obviously big practical worries about what it means to start etching inequality into our genes [by theoretically genetically engineering human embryos]—what are the health risks and so on. Those are all persuasive and powerful reasons not to do [human germline genetic engineering]. But they don't get at the deepest reason, which has to do with the meaning of being human. Just as it turned out that we were wrong to take the stability of the physical world for granted, we're also wrong to take the meaning of a human life for granted. I fear that it's not going to prove very hard to undermine that.\n\nDo you only see these two technologies (AI and germline engineering) as dangerous? Or do they also have something positive to offer people?  \n\nTechnologies come with a suite of benefits and costs. The classic example is fossil fuels: they did amazing things for us until we reached a point where we were using them in such quantity that they were doing damage. Now we need to find other ways to power our lives.\n\nI truthfully don't think that human genetic engineering offers us much in the way of benefit. If people are worried about genetic disease, we can already deal with that through preimplantation genetic diagnosis, which is used in fertility clinics around the world. It lets you make sure your child doesn't have a genetic disease, but it doesn't let you improve your child. So I don't think the benefits [of human germline genetic engineering] are very high, and the potential cost—in terms of meaning—is enormous. \n\nSome might say that you're being overly alarmist, especially in terms of AI and genetic engineering. How would you respond to that critique? \n\nI'm used to it because people said it for years about climate change. I wish that I had been [overly alarmist]. If anything, we've been under-alarmist about it. I think the biggest problem around AI and human genetic engineering is that we're barely discussing them in these terms. One of the points of this book is to get that discussion underway as fast as we can.\n\nGiven how little we've done to address climate change, where do we go from here? Do you see any potential solutions that could help us address the problem in time?  \n\nThe good news is that the engineers have done their job with remarkable speed and power. Thirty years ago we didn't know what was going to replace coal, oil and gas—we just knew they had to be replaced. But in the last decade, the price of a solar panel has dropped 90 percent. In most of the world now, solar and wind are the cheapest ways to produce energy.\n\nBut we're not making the transition quickly enough—not for lack of engineering, but for lack of political will. The fossil fuel industry has so much political power and it's willing to use it to maintain its business model, even at the expense of breaking the planet. So it's going to take a one-two punch of great engineering and great movement building. Over the last 10 years we've built a climate movement really out of nothing, and it continues to grow. You saw remarkable stuff this year with schoolchildren across the planet leaving their classrooms, demanding action. We're seeing young people push for a Green New Deal in the U.S. I don't know exactly what form all this will eventually take, in terms of legislation and policy, but I do know that that ferment is a good sign. People are not going to take this lying down.\n\nHow do we address these other existential threats—AI and genetic engineering? Will the approach be similar to climate change? \n\nWe're a little earlier in the curve, but you can already see people beginning to try and figure out responses to them—though I don't think people are talking deeply enough yet and I imagine it'll require movement-building in order to get those big conversations going. There are elements on both the political left and right that are made uneasy by these new technologies, and it will be interesting to see whether or not they can figure out how to work together.\n\nWhy did you write this book? What are you hoping it will accomplish? \n\nWhen I wrote The End of Nature 30 years ago, my theory of change was simple. I was 27 years old; I thought people would read my book and then they would change. I now know that that's not the way change happens. Books and arguments are one part of what needs to happen, but I spend most of my time now building movements. I think those are what really will move the needle. I hope that this book contributes a little to that movement-building process.\n\nBut I also just want to mark where we are. Thirty years ago my greatest fear for climate change, in a way, was that we'd walk off this cliff without even recognizing it. I think now at least there's going to be a serious fight. And that is, at the very least, a more dignified way for humans to be engaging with this greatest of crises.","title":"Environmental Thinker Bill McKibben Sounds Warning on Technology","origin":"Climate","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/0DE8A151-6C5D-4895-882250D340D0F97A_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&6E326104-A403-4251-8785E3D6E14D3919"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/worlds-first-hiv-to-hiv-kidney-transplant-with-living-donor-performed-successfully/","authors":"Victoria Knight, Carmen Heredia Rodriguez, Kaiser Health News","pub_date":"March 29, 2019","abstract":"The world’s first kidney transplant from a living HIV-positive donor to another HIV-positive person was successfully performed Monday by doctors at a Johns Hopkins University hospital.\n\nBy not having to rely solely on organs from the deceased, doctors may now have a larger number of kidneys available for transplant. Access to HIV-positive organs became possible in 2013, and surgeries have been limited to kidneys and livers.\n\n“It’s important to people who aren’t HIV-positive because every time somebody else gets a transplant and gets an organ and gets off the list, your chances get just a little bit better,” said Dr. Sander Florman, director of the Recanati/Miller Transplantation Institute at Mount Sinai in New York.\n\nNina Martinez, 35, is the living donor. She donated her kidney to an anonymous recipient after the friend she had hoped to give it to died last fall. Martinez acquired HIV when she was 6 weeks old through a blood transfusion and was diagnosed at age 8.\n\nIn a news conference Thursday, Martinez said that even after her friend died, she wanted to carry on in honoring him by donating her kidney and making a statement.\n\n“I wanted to show that people living with HIV were just as healthy. Someone needed that kidney, even if it was a kidney with HIV. I very simply wanted to show that I was just like anybody else,” said Martinez.\n\nJohns Hopkins said that Martinez was being discharged Thursday from the hospital. The anonymous recipient is in stable condition and will likely be discharged in the next couple of days.\n\nSince 1988, doctors have transplanted at least 1,788 kidneys and 507 livers—both HIV-positive and HIV-negative organs—to patients with HIV, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, a private nonprofit that manages the nation’s organ transplant waiting list. All the HIV-positive organs came from recently deceased people.\n\nJohns Hopkins Medicine was the first to perform the initial HIV-to-HIV transplant from a deceased donor in the U.S. in 2016.\n\nDr. Dorrey Segev, one of the Johns Hopkins surgeons who performed the organ transplant, said the surgery was no different than any other live donor transplant that he has done because Martinez’s HIV was so well-controlled by antiretroviral medication. He said Johns Hopkins has already been receiving calls from people living with HIV who want to be living organ donors.\n\n“This is not only a celebration of transplantation, but also HIV care,” said Segev during the news conference.\n\nPeople living with HIV have faced challenges participating in organ transplants as recipients and donors. Organ transplant centers initially hesitated to give these patients organs for fear of inadvertently infecting them with the virus or accelerating the onset of AIDS in the recipient. Physicians thought the medicines given to prevent organ rejection—which suppress the immune system—could allow HIV to attack more of the body’s cells, unchecked.\n\nYet, some centers assumed the risks and performed these procedures. “There were no rules,” Florman said. “That was the wild west.”\n\nTransplants slowly increased as more evidence proved liver and kidney recipients with HIV survived at rates similar to patients without the virus. But by the 2000s, the medical community and advocates wanted more. Prospective donors with HIV could not donate their organs, as Congress had banned the practice.\n\nThe push for change resulted in the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act, known as the HOPE Act, in 2013. This federal law allowed organ transplants between people with HIV in clinical trials. The legislation drastically cuts the waiting time for recipients with HIV who are willing to accept an organ from a person with the virus from years to months, Florman said. Only patients with HIV are allowed to accept these organs.\n\nKidney and liver transplants began under the HOPE Act three years after the legislation passed. As of March 24, 116 HOPE Act kidney and liver transplants have taken place.\n\nUNOS does not track HIV status information for transplant candidates on its waiting list. But, as of March 8, 221 registrants have indicated they would be willing to accept a kidney or liver from a donor who has HIV.\n\nUnder the HOPE Act, recipients and living donors must meet requirements like undetectable levels of HIV, a normal CD4 count—an important type of white blood cell—and no opportunistic infections. Deceased donors are highly scrutinized to make sure they do not have a strain of HIV that is difficult to manage or treat, Florman said.\n\nResearchers are seeking to expand the HOPE Act protocol to other organs. Dr. David Klassen, the chief medical officer for UNOS, said the Johns Hopkins living donor transplant opens up a promising new avenue for both organ recipients and donors living with HIV.\n\n“As we accumulate more safety data, I think it is possible that the HOPE Act could become a standard of care possibly in the next couple of years,” said Klassen. “At some point, I think this will move into the mainstream.”\n\nSome view the legislation not only as an avenue to advance medicine, but also to challenge how people perceive HIV. The ability to donate an organ implies a certain level of health that was once thought impossible in people living with HIV, said Peter Stock, professor of surgery at the University of California-San Francisco and one of the pioneering surgeons in HIV organ transplants.\n\n“It used to be a death sentence,” he said of HIV. “And now we’re transplanting them.”\n\nDr. Christine Durand, another Johns Hopkins surgeon involved in the organ transplant, encouraged those living with HIV to sign their organ donor cards and contact their local transplant center if they’re interested in living donation.\n\n“I am hoping this leads to a ripple effect,” said Durand. “And many people with HIV will be inspired to sign up as an organ donor as a result.”\n\nThis story was originally published by Kaiser Health News on March 28, 2019.

They are now with family at home, and an eighth child is slated to be released from hospital at the end of this week.\n\nThe children have mutations in a gene that is crucial for immune-system development, causing a disorder called X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1). The gene-therapy treatment replaces the mutated gene, called IL2RG, with a corrected copy. SCID-X1 and related disorders are sometimes called ‘bubble-boy’ diseases because of the plastic enclosures that were once used to protect affected children from possible infection. For them, even a common cold can be fatal.\n\nBut seven of the babies in the study, which was published on 17 April in The New England Journal of Medicine, now have immune systems that can protect them against common childhood ailments. “They are all toddlers now, exploring life and attending day cares,” says Ewelina Mamcarz, a physician at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and a lead author on the study.\n\nThe best treatment currently available for SCID-X1, which predominantly affects boys, is a bone-marrow transplant from a matched sibling donor. But that option is possible for less than 20% of children with the disorder. Researchers have been trying for nearly 20 years to develop a way of delivering a functional copy of the mutated gene to affected children who can’t receive such a transplant.\n\nThose efforts met with mixed results: the earliest trials partially improved immune responses, but caused leukaemia in some patients. In a follow-up effort in 2014, the same researchers altered a virus they had been using to shuttle functional copies of the IL2RG gene into cells. It still produced only partial improvement in immunity, but none of the children who were treated developed leukaemia.\n\nAn enduring cure?\n\nFor the latest trial, Mamcarz and her colleagues used yet another virus, this time a disabled relative of HIV. This virus is more adept than the ones researchers had previously used at inserting genes into cells that are not actively dividing — making it better suited for use in the slowly dividing stem cells responsible for generating immune cells.\n\nThe team also treated the children with a low dose of chemotherapy before the treatment. That approach is also used in another gene therapy for a related disease called ADA-SCID. That therapy was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2016.\n\nThe children treated for SCID-X1 have shown no signs of leukaemia up to two years after their treatment. Although some cases of leukaemia showed up after two years in previous studies, Fischer says that researchers have been using this viral system for other gene-therapy trials for a decade without any signs of leukaemia.\n\nAnd the children in the SCID-X1 trial are producing the proper components of a healthy immune system, including T cells, B cells and natural-killer cells. “This is a very nice contribution to the field,” says Alain Fischer at the College of France in Paris, who developed some of the first experimental gene therapies used to treat SCID-X1.\n\nThe results are promising, but researchers will need to continue monitoring the children to ensure that the immune capabilities they developed after treatment remain stable, says Marina Cavazzana, who is also working on gene therapies for SCID-X1 at Necker Hospital for Sick Children in Paris.\n\n“From a physiological point of view and from a quality-of-life point of view, this is a cure,” says James Downing, president of St. Jude Children’s. “Will it be a durable cure? Only time will tell.”\n\nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on April 17, 2019.","title":"Experimental Gene Therapy Frees “Bubble-boy” Babies from a Life of Isolation","origin":"Medical & Biotech","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/16B5896E-E1BC-44DA-B8773F8C5B479F19_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&60590D5C-A2F2-48E3-BBC588F92D3EC78E"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-strategies-take-on-the-worst-cancer-glioblastoma/","authors":"Bret Stetka","pub_date":"March 27, 2019","abstract":"The most common form of malignant brain cancer—called a glioblastoma—is notoriously wily and considered the deadliest human cancer. Glioblastomas charge their way into normal brain tissue diffusely and erratically, making them surgical nightmares. And they mutate at such a rapid rate that most currently available cancer treatments can't keep up with them. Even neighboring tumor cells can be genetically distinct, and therefore hard to target with a single therapy. \n\nSurvival rates from glioblastomas enjoyed a modest bump in the 1980s when radiation became a standard part of the treatment protocol. Patients could expect to live for nearly another year after diagnosis, up from just four to six months. The introduction of the chemotherapy drug temozolomide in the 2000s increased survival another few months. But since then patient survival rates have stalled.\n\nIn recent years, glioblastomas famously claimed the lives of senators Ted Kennedy and John McCain, and Joe Biden’s son Beau. Even access to what was presumably some of our country’s best cancer care couldn’t save the high-profile politicos. New approaches to treating this scourge of the brain are desperately needed. And many experts insist the key to beating glioblastoma will entail personalizing care to a patient’s individual tumor and the particular molecular signature of a cancer.\n\nOne method of testing cancer therapies, including glioblastomas, has been so-called “ex vivo” cancer models, in which malignant cells are probed in the lab. Also known as tumor “avatars,” they allow researchers to test a drug on patients’ cancer cells before introducing it into their bodies. A number of ex vivo models have been tried over the years: culturing tumor cells in Petri dishes; grafting them into animal models; even growing “organoids” (three-dimensional tumors grown on a supporting matrix). These techniques have seen varying success depending on the tumor type at hand, but none have proven especially helpful for glioblastoma.\n\nA report on new research technology published recently in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering may address the limitations of previous ex vivo approaches. In short, researchers have concocted a glioblastoma-on-a-chip. Chip-based models of various organs and diseases—including many cancers—have debuted in the last few years. They are constructed by lining a plastic microchip with live human cells that mimic a particular organ or disease in order to simplify, cheapen and increase the efficiency of drug testing. The Wyss Institute at Harvard University and other groups have made impressive headway in developing a number of chip-based biologic models. Chip models of the lung, the intestine, skin, bone marrow ALS—even the blood-brain barrier—have been tested.\n\nThe new report of a chip from researchers in South Korea may represent the most advanced ex vivo model of a glioblastoma to date. The authors used bioprinting technology to put brain tumor cells from human patients on the chip alongside blood vessel–like cells printed in a ring around the tumor, mimicking the vital oxygen supply required by a glioblastoma. Further away from an air supply, the cells at the center of glioblastomas in humans tend to die and form a necrotic core. Finally, the researchers also incorporated an “extracellular matrix” into their model, the three-dimensional network of connective tissue, enzymes and other proteins that support animal cells, including tumors. This matrix is thought to play an essential role in how cancer behaves in the body.\n\nThe new model successfully mimicked the treatment responses seen in the patients from which the tumor samples were derived. Chip tumors from patients highly resistant to the standard glioblastoma treatment regimen—radiation combined with temozolomide—did not respond to therapy. Tumors printed from less resistant patients were, in turn, found to be more responsive to treatment.\n\n“To the best of my knowledge, we have bioprinted cancer-on-a-chip for the first time,” says Dong-Woo Cho, a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea, and senior author of the new report. “Furthermore, our study is the first attempt to actually reproduce the patient’s therapeutic responses with personalized cancer-on-a-chip.” Cho believes that eventually their chip model could help prolong survival in patients with glioblastomas by guiding appropriate treatment selection. “I believe the day when we test cancer cells derived from patients that are cultured with a platform that mimics real cancer biology will come soon,” he says.\n\nNader Sanai, a neurosurgeon specializing in cancer of the brain at the Barrow Neurologic Institute in Phoenix, is supportive of ex vivo modeling research. Yet he feels despite advances like that of the Korean group, these approaches still come with significant limitations. “The challenge with all of these models is that they just can’t fully recreate what’s happening in the patient’s brain,” Sanai explained. “The reason is in part because you’re only taking cells from a small portion of the tumor; but glioblastomas are not homogenous.”\n\nHe says that one of the most challenging features of glioblastomas is just how heterogenous they are: “These are really disparate collections of cells, many using different biologic pathways. This is why most drugs have not worked, and why so many models don’t represent the complete biology of the tumors.”  \n\nSanai directs Barrow’s Ivy Brain Tumor Center, a collaboration with the Ivy Foundation dedicated to one day curing brain cancer (Barrow treats more brain tumor patients than any other site in the U.S.). As part of his role as director, he oversees the center’s “phase 0” clinical trials program. Phase 0 trials are means of better customizing drug therapy to each specific patient.\n\nDuring such a trial, a genetic analysis is performed on previous surgical tumor samples from a given patient to help determine which combination of experimental drugs makes the most sense to try. Many of the drugs they experiment with are already being tested for other cancer types, so they often have some degree of a proven safety record.\n\nNext, prior to a patient undergoing a follow-up surgery to remove a newly grown tumor, Sanai and his team administer their chosen chemotherapeutic drug cocktail. The goal is to address two questions: is their drug regimen actually getting to the tumor, and is it attacking the molecular targets it was intended to?\n\nSanai laments that while ex vivo models of other cancer types can be fairly faithful representations of their human counterpart, this just isn’t true for glioblastoma. The blood-brain barrier forms a rather impenetrable citadel around the organ, so getting a drug past it remains a challenge. Knowing whether or not a drug is even getting to the brain—and that it’s working to eradicate tumor cells, the goal of a Phase 0 trial—could be a huge boon to therapy selection.\n\nAfter his patient’s surgeries, Sanai and his team spend a week or so analyzing the excised tumor while the patient recovers. At that point they usually have a good idea of whether their drug regimen could prove to be a good candidate. If so, the patient is treated. “If not, we may pivot them to another therapy; to another trial,” he says.\n\nThe Ivy group has recruited nearly 150 patients since it opened in May of 2018. Enrollment is pacing at an additional 10 or so patients a month. “Have we been successful?” he asks. “It depends how you define success. We haven’t cured anyone. But we have identified a lot of drugs and drug cocktails that incrementally seem to be improving outcomes in our patients. It’s an iterative process.”\n\nSanai acknowledges that even if a patient benefits from a phase 0 trial, the tumor will in all likelihood mutate and recur. “They’ll land back in the OR,” he says, “and we’ll ask ourselves, ‘Okay, how did this tumor change? Why did it stop responding?’” This, he says, informs the team as to what the next collection of drugs should be.\n\nTreating glioblastoma seems like a Sisyphean undertaking. Even pancreatic cancer, widely considered the second grimmest cancer diagnosis, has a few consistent genetic blips that suggest a common therapy among patients is a possibility. While this wasn’t thought to be the case with glioblastoma, encouraging research continues to trickle in.\n\nA study published last week in Cancer Cell, reported on three specific genetic alterations that appear to drive the early development of glioblastomas. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center tested glioblastoma samples from 50 patients, including both their initial tumor as well as any recurrences. By analyzing tumor genomes they were able to trace back how these tumors had mutated and evolved. They found that on average the glioblastomas had developed for up to seven years prior to diagnosis, a surprising discovery given the rapid rate these cancers are presumed to proliferate.\n\nThe investigators found that all of the tested glioblastomas had at least one of three specific genetic alterations early in their development. These were either complete or partial gain of chromosome 7 or 10, or a loss of part of chromosome 9.\n\nThese genetic alterations only appear to drive tumor growth early in glioblastoma development. Recurrent tumors, by contrast, didn’t appear to have specific mutations common among them. This suggests that current glioblastoma treatments aren’t creating a selective pressure and driving the formation of resistant recurrent tumors. The implication of these results is that the failure of so many investigational drugs in glioblastoma is because they’re not effectively attacking the tumor, compared to the alternative scenario of the cancer outrunning a potentially effective treatment by mutating. \n\nThe authors contend their work suggests that we urgently need new treatments for glioblastoma. Sanai, for his part, suggests that in the future the whole concept of glioblastomas may evolve. “Right now, we tend to think of glioblastoma as a single disease,” he says. “However, we’re already dividing it into subsets with unique biologic profiles.” He believes that there aren’t just a few glioblastoma subtypes, but probably hundreds, if not more.\n\n“I think 10 years from now the term glioblastoma will be a bit anachronistic,” he foresees. “I think we’ll need to drill down into various biomarkers and genetic changes of specific variants. We’ll need to customize therapy. That’s how we’ll make the most progress.”","title":"New Strategies Take on the Worst Cancer--Glioblastoma","origin":"Medical & Biotech","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/9C602FF5-3834-46F7-960E5E976066E9F9_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&FCC24C52-179A-4141-805C58C846079865"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-case-of-a-woman-who-feels-almost-no-pain-leads-scientists-to-a-new-gene-mutation/","authors":"Jacquelyn Corley, STAT","pub_date":"March 30, 2019","abstract":"Doctors in Scotland were amazed when a 66-year-old woman underwent what is normally a very painful operation on her hand for severe arthritis and required little to no pain medication afterward. Similarly, two years ago, she was diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis in her hip with significant joint degeneration, yet she complained of no discomfort before, during, or after her hip replacement surgery.\n\nIn fact, the patient told her doctors, there have been times she had burned herself and withdrew her hand from the flame only when she smelled burning flesh. She also scored remarkably low on anxiety and depression tests.\n\nThinking the woman’s exceptional insensitivity to pain might be rooted in her genes, researchers in the United Kingdom sequenced and analyzed her genome and found a previously unidentified mutation, they reported Wednesday in the British Journal of Anaesthesia. That mutation, in a region they named FAAH-OUT, seems to turn down the activity of a neighboring gene called FAAH, which is known to be involved in pain sensation, mood, and memory.\n\nFAAH is a protein that breaks down anandamide, also known as the “bliss molecule,” which is a neurotransmitter that binds to cannabinoid receptors. These are some of the same receptors that are activated by marijuana. With less FAAH activity, this patient was found to have more circulating levels of anandamide, which may explain her resistance to feeling pain.\n\nWhile it’s risky to make too much of one patient’s case, the researchers said their discovery could have exciting implications for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Prior genetic targets for pain treatment have focused on sodium ion channels and the transmission of pain signals from the peripheral nervous system to the brain. The FAAH and FAAH-OUT genes instead alter how pain signals are interpreted by the brain.\n\nWhile previous studies and trials of experimental drugs directed at FAAH have failed, the researchers said FAAH-OUT may offer a new way to target the endocannabinoid receptor. At a time when about 130 Americans die daily from opioid overdoses, scientists and drug companies are actively pursuing alternative non-opioid medications for acute and chronic pain.\n\n“This discovery opens up numerous possibilities of developing drugs using the endocannabinoid pathway to modify how pain is experienced,” said Dr. Dev Srivastava, one of the investigators and a consultant in anesthesia and pain medicine at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness, Scotland. “This could be developed into a wonder drug to treat surgical patients or those with cancer or chronic pain.”\n\nHowever, as with the Scottish patient, complete elimination of pain sensation can be problematic. Similar to patients who suffer from painful diabetic neuropathies, the resulting decreased sensation to extremities can sometimes result in repeated injuries that are not noticed by the patient. Dr. James Cox, another author and senior lecturer at the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research at University College London, said, “Pain is an essential warning system to protect you from damaging and life-threatening events.”\n\nAnother disadvantage to endocannabinoids and their receptor targets is that poor memory and learning may be unwanted byproducts. Researchers said the Scottish woman reported memory lapses, which mirrors what is seen in mice missing the FAAH gene.\n\nThe investigators were also quick to caution patients and providers that, while this research demonstrates analgesic effects within the endocannabinoid pathway, this does not mean that recreational cannabis works the same or can be used as a substitute for pain control. The opioid crisis in the United States began with people becoming addicted to legal pain medications and was followed by spikes in use of heroin and illicitly made fentanyl. If endocannabinoid-pathway medications become prevalent, illegal counterparts could similarly become a concern.\n\nRepublished with permission from STAT.

Now, although still a long way from restoring natural speech, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, have generated intelligible sentences from the thoughts of people without speech difficulties.\n\nThe work provides a proof of principle that it should one day be possible to turn imagined words into understandable, real-time speech circumventing the vocal machinery, Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon at U.C.S.F. and co-author of the study published Wednesday in Nature, said Tuesday in a news conference. “Very few of us have any real idea of what’s going on in our mouth when we speak,” he said. “The brain translates those thoughts of what you want to say into movements of the vocal tract, and that’s what we want to decode.”\n\nBut Chang cautions that the technology, which has only been tested on people with typical speech, might be much harder to make work in those who cannot speak—and particularly in people who have never been able to speak because of a movement disorder such as cerebral palsy.\n\n\n\nIllustrations of electrode placements on the research participants’ neural speech centers, from which activity patterns recorded during speech (colored dots) were translated into a computer simulation of the participant’s vocal tract (model, right) which then could be synthesized to reconstruct the sentence that had been spoken (sound wave & sentence, below).  Credit: Chang lab and the UCSF Dept. of Neurosurgery\n\n\n\nChang also emphasized that his approach cannot be used to read someone’s mind—only to translate words the person wants to say into audible sounds. “Other researchers have tried to look at whether or not it’s actually possible to decode essentially just thoughts alone,” he says.* “It turns out it’s a very difficult and challenging problem. That’s only one reason of many that we focus on what people are trying to say.”\n\nChang and his colleagues devised a two-step method for translating thoughts into speech. First, in tests with epilepsy patients whose neural activity was being measured with electrodes on the surface of their brain, the researchers recorded signals from brain areas that control the tongue, lips and throat muscles. Later, using deep-learning computer algorithms trained on naturally spoken words, they translated those movements into audible sentences.\n\nAt this point, a decoding system would have to be trained on each person’s brain, but the translation into sounds can be generalized across people, said co-author Gopala Anumanchipalli, also of U.C.S.F. “Neural activity is not one-on-one transferrable across subjects, but the representations underneath are sharable, and that’s what our paper explores,” he said.\n\nThe researchers asked native English speakers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing marketplace to transcribe the sentences they heard. The listeners accurately heard the sentences 43 percent of the time when given a set of 25 possible words to choose from, and 21 percent of the time when given 50 words, the study found.\n\nAlthough the accuracy rate remains low, it would be good enough to make a meaningful difference to a “locked-in” person, who is almost completely paralyzed and unable to speak, the researchers say. “For someone who’s locked in and can’t communicate at all, a few minor errors would be acceptable,” says Marc Slutzky, a neurologist and neural engineer at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who has published related research but was not involved in the new study. “Even a few hundred words would be a huge improvement,” he says. “Obviously you’d want to [be able to] say any word you’d want to, but it would still be a lot better than having to type out words one letter at a time, which is the [current] state of the art.”\n\nEven when the volunteers did not hear the sentences entirely accurately, the phrases were often similar in meaning to those that were silently spoken. For example, “rabbit” was heard as “rodent,” Josh Chartier of U.C.S.F., another co-author of the study, said at the news conference. Sounds like the “sh” in “ship” were decoded particularly well, whereas sounds like “th” in “the” were especially challenging, Chartier added.\n\nSeveral other research groups in the United States and elsewhere are also making significant advances in decoding speech, but the new study marks the first time that full sentences have been correctly interpreted, according to Slutzky and other scientists not involved in the work.\n\n“I think this paper is an example of the power that can come from thinking about how to harness both the biology and the power of machine learning,” says Leigh Hochberg, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and a neuroscientist at Brown University and Providence VA Medical Center. Hochberg was not involved in the work.\n\nThe study is generating excitement in the field, but researchers say the technology is not yet ready for clinical trials. “Within the next 10 years, I think that we’ll be seeing systems that will improve people’s ability to communicate,” says Jaimie Henderson, a professor of neurosurgery at Stanford University, who was not involved in the new study. He says the remaining challenges include determining whether using finer-grained analysis of brain activity will improve speech decoding; developing a device that can be implanted in the brain and can decode speech in real time; and extending the benefits to people who cannot speak at all (whose brains have not been primed to talk).\n\nHochberg says he is reminded of what is at stake in this kind of research “every time I’m in the neuro–intensive care unit and I see somebody who may have been walking and talking without difficulty yesterday, but who had a stroke and now can no longer can either move or speak.” Although he would love for the work to move faster, Hochberg says he is pleased with field’s progress. “I think brain-computer interfaces will have a lot of opportunity to help people, and hopefully, to help people quickly.”\n\n*Editor’s Note (April 24, 2019): This quote has been updated. Chang clarified his original statement to specify that his lab has not attempted to decode thoughts alone.","title":"Scientists Take a Step Toward Decoding Speech from the Brain","origin":"Neuroscience","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/F1384F0B-B13B-4E53-B62F0626E40C9DD1_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&28D0017C-BFF7-4C44-B8926C262E239A0D"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/anti-aging-discovery-could-lead-to-restorative-skin-treatments/","authors":"Dana G. Smith","pub_date":"April 4, 2019","abstract":"Despite a multi-billion-dollar skin care industry and plenty of marketing claims, nothing exists that can prevent our skin from turning into tissue paper as we age—except, perhaps, religiously wearing sunscreen. Accumulated damage from UV radiation and other age-related stressors drains the skin’s pool of renewal cells—or stem cells—and there is no way to stop or slow this process.\n\nBut hope for skincare junkies is on the horizon. A study published April 3 in Nature provides new insight into how stem cell loss occurs and even identifies two chemicals that may be able to prevent it.\n\nThe research, led by Emi Nishimura, a professor of stem cell biology at Tokyo Medical and Dental University in Japan, revealed that aging and UV exposure deplete stem cells of a crucial collagen protein. Skin aficionados may recognize collagen as a key player in maintaining strong, youthful, elastic skin. The weakened stem cells no longer divide normally, and are ultimately forced to turn into adult skin cells. Over time, so many stem cells become damaged that there aren’t enough healthy ones to replace them.\n\n“I think it’s a beautiful study,” says David Fisher, a professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the research. “I think it’s a very elegant analysis, but also it has some very practical mechanistic insights into how this is happening, and even potentially actionable ones to promote youthfulness.”\n\nOur skin is divided into two sections: the epidermis on top and the dermis underneath. The epidermis is what we conventionally think of as our skin and is made up of many layers of cells, while the dermis consists of connective tissue, hair follicles, blood vessels, and sweat glands.\n\nAs part of normal skin health, the top layer of the epidermis is constantly being sloughed off and replaced from a self-replenishing pool of stem cells that hangs out on the bottom (or basal) layer. These stem cells have roots that anchor them to a thin piece of tissue called the basement membrane that connects the epidermis and the dermis. The tether to the basement membrane is essential for maintaining a cell’s “steminess\"—its ability to replicate and mature into another type of cell.\n\nMost of the time, the stem cells in the epidermis divide horizontally, cloning themselves and adding to the renewal pool. Sometimes, though, they divide vertically, and the new cell starts to mature into an adult skin cell, which is gradually pushed up through the layers of the epidermis.\n\nThis type of cell turnover—replacing older cells at the top of the epidermis with younger cells from the bottom—explains how cuts heal and skin stays young looking. As people age, however, the pool of stem cells becomes depleted and cell turnover slows, eventually leaving people with thin, fragile skin.\n\n“The ultimate question, which [the study is] trying to address, is why are there fewer cells? Why do we lose stem cells as we get older?” says Terry Lechler, an associate professor of dermatology at Duke University who was not involved in the research. “I think that's the real crux and the really interesting question.”\n\nThe study suggests that the stem cells that divide vertically do so because they are damaged through regular aging and the normal cell turnover process, as well as exposure to UV light or other types of toxins. And not only does the new adult cell start its journey through the epidermis, the original stem cell also gets pushed off of the basal layer, forcing it to mature. This is because the damaged stem cell’s roots have become weakened, so it can no longer sufficiently anchor to the basement membrane. The researchers describe this step as a kind of competition, the neighboring healthy stem cells banding together and forcing the weak stem cell off of the island.\n\n“It appears that this is due to a quality-control mechanism whereby a skin stem cell that gets damaged is basically purged from the skin,” says James DeGregori, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Colorado Denver who wrote a commentary article to accompany the paper. “You could almost imagine all of these stem cells are kind of jostling for position, and if you're really gripping that basement membrane, you're going to do better.”\n\nAt first this competition is beneficial, ridding the skin of malfunctioning cells or even cancer-causing mutations. However, at a certain point too many stem cells become damaged and they begin to outnumber the healthy ones. When this happens, the skin can no longer effectively rejuvenate itself or respond to injury. “Stem cell competition between epidermal stem cells sustains skin youthfulness, but the decline of the competition ends up with skin aging,” Nishimura explains.\n\nThe linchpin in this process is collagen 17, a specific type of collagen protein that is critical for rooting the stem cell to the basement membrane. As stem cells become damaged, they lose precious amounts of collagen 17. The more protein they lose, the weaker their bond to the basement membrane, until eventually they are forced out by neighboring healthy cells.\n\nThe good news is that there may be a way to increase or preserve levels of collagen 17 in stem cells, staving off this process of skin aging. Nishimura showed that two experimental chemicals, Y27632 and apocynin, applied topically can increase collagen 17 levels in cells and even promote wound healing.\n\nThis does not mean you should purchase the next skin care product you see that has “collagen” or “stem cells” on the label—there is no evidence that anything on the market affects this pathway. But it does suggest a scientifically backed rejuvenating cream could be on the horizon.","title":"Anti-Aging Discovery Could Lead to Restorative Skin Treatments","origin":"The Body","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/EE3378BE-2DF6-4528-B9E095DD718D81FA_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&5350BE0B-FE27-4BF8-8DEBC3FF5F1564C4"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-baby-monkey-born-using-sperm-from-frozen-testicles/","authors":"Emily Mullin","pub_date":"March 21, 2019","abstract":"In a notable step for male fertility preservation, a procedure that involves removing and freezing immature testicular tissue and then reimplanting it later has resulted in the first live birth of a healthy monkey.\n\nThe technique could theoretically help prepubescent boys who are about to undergo cancer treatments, about 30 percent of whom become infertile from the harsh effects of chemotherapy and radiation. Currently, these boys have no options if they want to have biological children in the future.\n\nDoctors can freeze sperm from adult male patients, but boys do not start producing mature sex cells until they reach puberty. At that point, hormonal changes in the body ramp up testosterone levels, spurring stem cells in the testes to develop into sperm. Chemotherapy and radiation treatments can deplete these stem cells, resulting in low sperm levels and infertility.\n\nIn the new study, investigators at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and their colleagues surgically removed and froze testicular tissue from five juvenile rhesus macaques that were too young to produce sperm. The macaques were then neutered to make sure they were sterile. When the monkeys reached puberty, the frozen tissue was thawed and grafted under the scrotum of the same animal from which it was originally taken.\n\nEight to 12 months later, scientists harvested tissue from the graft sites and extracted sperm from it in the lab. The tissue produced enough sperm to fertilize 138 eggs. Of these, only 16 turned into embryos suitable for implantation. The researchers transferred 11 of these embryos into female macaques, which resulted in one pregnancy and a subsequent live birth. The findings were detailed Thursday in Science.\n\n“We grafted tissue that had zero sperm at the beginning of the experiment, and when we collected the grafts, they were producing millions and millions of sperm,” says Kyle Orwig, senior author of the study and a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. “We’re confident that if the same thing happens with human tissue, we’ll have more than enough sperm to fertilize an egg and establish a pregnancy.”\n\nAs for the low yield of embryos, Orwig says it is possible that the procedure affected the sperm quality but notes other factors, such as egg quality and breeding time, as possible culprits. Typically, macaques breed from October through May. The first two experiments Orwig and his team conducted were at the end and beginning of the breeding season, respectively, and neither attempt resulted in a pregnancy. The researchers’ third attempt, in November 2017, led to the birth of a healthy female baby monkey last April.\n\n“The challenge has been that you’re starting from this very immature stem cell population, and you have to find conditions that will allow them to mature from that very undifferentiated state to completely mature sperm,” says Susan Taymans, a program officer at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, who was not involved in the study but whose institution helped fund it.\n\nScientists had previously used a similar technique in mice to produce healthy pups. Other researchers had attempted to freeze and graft testicular tissue in monkeys, too, but these efforts did not result in a pregnancy. Robert Brannigan, a reproductive urologist and male infertility specialist at Northwestern University, who was not involved in the work, says Orwig and his team might have been successful because they used larger tissue grafts and waited longer to harvest the tissue for sperm after reimplanting it.\n\nA similar procedure for women—ovarian tissue freezing and transplantation—has been available to female cancer patients for several years and has resulted in more than 100 live births. One published case involved a woman who had frozen her ovarian tissue as a prepubescent girl. Tissue freezing is more common for women with a cancer diagnosis because they might not have time to freeze their eggs before undergoing treatment.\n\nIn contrast, it is much easier to obtain a semen sample. As a result, testicular tissue freezing is very rarely done in adult men with cancer. Tissue freezing for boys who are starting cancer treatment is currently offered at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Mayo Clinic, as well as a few sites around the world, in anticipation of future fertility technology becoming available. Branigan says the tissue extraction is usually done alongside other planned procedures, such as a biopsy or catheter implantation to deliver chemotherapy. Orwig is optimistic that the transplant procedure will move to clinical trials within the next few years.\n\nAlthough the technique could allow male childhood cancer survivors to have their own biological children, they would most likely have to use assisted reproductive technology, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization, Orwig says. This is the case because it is challenging to “hook up the plumbing” between the grafted tissue and the rest of male reproductive system, he says. “When we graft tissue, there’s no way for sperm to come out into the ejaculate.” So the tissue will have to come out of the body and be dissected to release the sperm.\n\nOne concern with taking tissue from cancer patients is the possibility of removing tumor cells along with the testicular tissue that then gets transplanted back into patients later on. For boys with some types of cancer, such as testicular cancer, leukemia or lymphoma, this method might come with a higher risk. Taymans says that doctors would need to follow patients over time to make sure their cancer does not reemerge. In rare cases, a patient’s cancer might damage the testes to the point where he is unable to produce sperm.\n\nAnother question is when the tissue grafts should be reimplanted and harvested for sperm. Orwig says it might be better to do it when the boy is a teenager rather than waiting until he is ready to have a family. “That way, he’ll know even when he’s a teenager that he has sperm waiting for him, and he’ll be able to have a biological child in the future.”","title":"First Baby Monkey Born Using Sperm from Frozen Testicles","origin":"Medical & Biotech","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/BE5C90EA-4DAE-40D7-BD2638F1CCE3CE7A_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&2F3FFC5E-F6B5-4F3C-B666E103C6DE7C5B"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/as-scientists-probe-the-mystery-of-how-newborns-develop-immunity-order-rises-from-the-chaos/","authors":"Karen Weintraub","pub_date":"March 13, 2019","abstract":"Much about the immune system has long been mysterious to scientists. Its activity is incredibly complicated and varies greatly between individuals; a deeper understanding of how the system works could lead to more and better vaccines, and even to a clearer distinction between health and disease.\n\nNow three studies report finding new patterns amid the apparent chaos—including in the crucial days just after birth, when the immune system faces many threats from the outside world for the first time.\n\nEuropean researchers last year published an analysis of the immune systems of 100 infants—half born prematurely—between one and 12 weeks after birth. And in a study appearing this week in Nature Communications, a global consortium of researchers began laying a baseline for healthy immune system development by examining which genes, proteins and immune cells are active during a newborn’s first seven days. “Massive molecular changes are occurring across the first week of life,” says Ofer Levy, a staff physician and director of the Precision Vaccines program at Boston Children's Hospital, who helped lead the most recent study. “Over 1,000 genes changing, many proteins changing, hundreds of metabolites—we’re talking about pretty radical shifts.”\n\nBoth of these studies—and a third that looks at the adult immune system—are part of a growing effort to understand not just the system’s pieces but how they fit together, says Petter Brodin, a pediatric immunologist and associate professor at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, who was the senior author on last year’s paper. “The immune system is so complex; there are so many moving parts,” Brodin says. “If we focus only on, let’s say, one type of cell or protein, we’re not going to be able to see how the system as a whole is wired, or how it’s regulated and functions in a given patient at a given time.”\n\nBrodin adds he was surprised when his own research indicated babies’ immune systems respond to birth in similar ways, regardless of whether they are born full-term or premature. “Something happens when the child comes out and faces the environment for the very first time,” he says. “There’s a lot of drastic changes happening.” Brodin’s research shows bacteria rapidly colonize newborns’ digestive tracts, skin and lungs—which he says appears to be the “driving force” behind the changes. “We think that’s the trigger that happens after birth, which is the reason all of the children are responding so similarly, because they’re all colonized,” he says. More research could help distinguish normal individual variation and determine how newborns with certain characteristics will fare later in childhood, he notes.\n\nIn the study published this week, Levy and the other researchers in the international group compared two blood samples from each of 30 newborns in Gambia in west Africa, validating their findings in another 30 newborns halfway around the world in Papua New Guinea. They were able to get immense amounts of data on each child from only one milliliter of blood, which would not have been possible just a few years ago, says Levy, who is also a professor at Harvard Medical School. Although the newborns showed a lot of variation in measures of gene, immune and metabolic activity, the team was surprised to find “core signatures,” he says, as the babies’ genetic and immune activities changed during the first week after birth. The study begins to set a baseline for immune behavior that will be useful for understanding how premature or sick babies differ from that norm, says Levy, whose team is now studying how vaccines affect this trajectory.\n\nJames Wynn, an associate professor at the University of Florida who studies blood infections in newborns, agrees the consortium’s study helps establish such a baseline—“what the road map is during that first week.” Wynn, who was not involved in any of the new studies, says he is eager to see data on even more babies—particularly premature infants like those he treats and studies. “I think this work is foundational for determining a disease state,” he says.\n\nIn a third recent study, which looked at the immune system in adulthood, scientists at Stanford University and in Israel have spent more than nine years following activity in the immune systems of 135 adults of various ages. That research, published earlier this month in Nature Medicine, indicates that although every adult’s immune system is different, age-related changes follow along a common trajectory. It is as if everyone is driving to the same location but at different speeds, says Shai Shen-Orr, co-senior author and head of the Systems Immunology and Precision Medicine lab at Technion–Israel Institute of Technology.\n\nShen-Orr says he and his collaborators have used this information to develop a clinical measure of immune health that can tell patients whether their immune system is functioning appropriately—similar to the way cholesterol levels and blood pressure are used to determine cardiovascular health. The data might also help identify people who will not benefit from flu vaccines, he says, adding it could even potentially serve as a reference point for lifestyle changes or medications intended to slow immunological aging.\n\nWayne Koff, president and CEO of the Human Vaccines Project (an international nonprofit organization working to decode the human immune system), says all these big-picture investigations of the system are crucial for developing next-generation vaccines. Those that are easy to make have already been made, he says; studies like these, which reveal the detailed workings of the immune system, are essential for expanding the portfolio of diseases that can be prevented or treated. “In the last maybe six to eight years, people have realized that understanding the underlying complexity of the human immune system is really at the core of the next revolution in public health,” he says. “It’s the next frontier of medicine.”","title":"As Scientists Probe the Mystery of How Newborns Develop Immunity, Order Rises from the Chaos","origin":"Medical & Biotech","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/599221E3-0D1D-43E2-8D333E3540F904F9_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&0F436B61-C10A-474B-BB7B0E96FB654B9A"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stanford-clears-three-faculty-members-of-crispr-babies-involvement/","authors":"Sharon Begley, STAT","pub_date":"April 17, 2019","abstract":"Stanford University cleared three faculty members of any misconduct in their interactions with the Chinese scientist who created “CRISPR babies” last year, the school announced on Tuesday evening.

Quake was He’s postdoctoral adviser in 2011 and 2012.\n\n“The review found that the Stanford researchers expressed serious concerns to Dr. He about his work,” the university said in a statement. “When Dr. He did not heed their recommendations and proceeded, Stanford researchers urged him to follow proper scientific practices, which included identifying an unmet medical need, securing informed consent, obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and publishing the research in a peer-reviewed journal.”\n\nHe, a researcher at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, used the genome-editing technology CRISPR in single-cell IVF embryos. His intention was to alter a gene called CCR5 into a form that prevents HIV from entering cells, which he justified by saying the edit would protect against AIDS. The university fired him, and in January a government investigation concludedhe had defied government bans on embryo editing in the pursuit of personal fame.\n\nPorteus and other scientists whom He informed about his plan have said that although they strongly disapproved of embryo editing—which they viewed as not ready to be used in humans and for a purpose (preventing HIV infection) that does not constitute a serious unmet medical need—they did not know how to inform authorities of He’s intention. In the wake of He’s announcement last November, the World Health Organization and other scientific groups are trying to develop a registry where scientists conducting human genome editing studies would voluntarily report their work, and through which scientists could raise concerns about the work of other researchers.\n\n“I don’t think they did anything wrong but I do wish each had done something more but more that science had established a framework to encourage them to do so,” Stanford law professor and bioethicist Hank Greely tweeted in response to the university statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Rice University has still not announced any results from its investigation into bioengineer Michael Deem, who reportedly worked on the research with He.

But this method requires equipment and medical expertise that are not always available in some low-income countries. Now scientists are making an app they hope could use artificial intelligence to identify precancerous or cancerous cells with just a photograph.\n\nThe app is being developed by researchers at the National Institutes of Health and Global Good; the latter is a joint effort by Bill Gates and invention firm Intellectual Ventures. Their preliminary results, published online in January in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, suggest that such an approach could significantly improve cervical cancer diagnosis in low-resource settings.\n\nCervical cancer rates are higher in countries or regions that lack the resources to conduct pap smears. Health care providers in these areas often use a less accurate diagnostic technique, in which they swab the cervix with dilute acetic acid and visually inspect it for any white spots that might signal abnormal cells.\n\nOver a seven-year period NIH researchers routinely photographed the cervixes of more than 9,400 women in Costa Rica. They used these images to train an AI algorithm to recognize characteristics of abnormal tissue—and to predict later cancer development. When the algorithm analyzed new images, it performed better than a clinical expert did by visual inspection.\n\n“We were surprised to see that computers could see much more sensitively and clearly which cervixes are or are not precancerous,” says Mark Schiffman, a molecular epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute and senior author of the paper. “I really thought [the AI was] cheating.” The scientists ultimately plan to implement their algorithm on mobile phones and aim to train future iterations of the program with digital camera photos.","title":"AI-Based App Could Screen for Cervical Cancer","origin":"Medical & Biotech","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/5A8378C0-C249-4C65-83B065B4FC941747_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&227EC6A4-CA32-4C7D-BCD55CFF6174AE16"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-new-way-to-detect-parkinsons-by-smell/","authors":"Jonathan D. Grinstein","pub_date":"April 10, 2019","abstract":"Scent has been used as a diagnostic tool by physicians for thousands of years. But smell tests are not common in modern medicine—when’s the last time you were smelled by your doctor or received a batch of smell results back from the lab? Now, new research suggests that odors can be used to screen for Parkinson’s disease, which currently is without a definitive diagnostic.\n\nIn the animal kingdom, scents emitted from a body often signal information about an individual’s mental or physical state. For example, stressed rodents have been shown to excrete distinctive odors. Human body odors also have this function, emitting a wide array of odor and non-odor related chemicals called volatile organic compounds. These compounds are emitted from different areas of the human body and vary with age, diet, sex and possibly genetic background. Moreover, disease processes can influence our daily odor by changing these compounds.\n\nSo, it is perhaps not surprising that physicians have used their sense of smell to diagnose patients. In ancient Greece, Hippocrates—of the eponymous medical oath—recognized the diagnostic usefulness of body odors and reported on several disease-specific smells from urine. In an experiment published in 1776, English doctor Matthew Dobson evaporated a diabetes patient’s urine, yielding a white, granulated powder that smelled and tasted like sugar. More recently, the composition of exhaled breath was shown to be different in patients with lung cancer, inflammatory lung or liver disease, hepatic or renal dysfunction or diabetes. However, there has been little evidence to tie scent to diseases of the nervous system, with the possible exception of schizophrenia—although controversial, it has long been claimed that these patients have a particular peculiar odor.\n\nHere’s where Joy Milne comes in, a woman who first noticed a \"musky\" smell on her husband Les, who was diagnosed years later with Parkinson's disease. It turns out that Joy can distinguish the unique Parkinson's odor before clinical symptoms appear in a person’s sebum—the moisturizing, waterproofing wax that protects the skin produced by sebaceous glands. Characterizing the compounds linked to this distinctive odor in sebum could enable rapid, early screening of Parkinson’s disease as well as provide insights into changes that occur as the disease progresses. Which is exactly what researchers were able to do—chemically define the scent in sebum that Milne is picking up on in Parkinson's patients.\n\nIn preliminary tests to identify the origin of the scent, Joy inspected T-shirts and medical gauze that had sampled the upper backs of Parkinson’s patients. The odor was not present in the armpits and instead was on the forehead and upper back—not surprisingly, areas of high sebum production. The researchers then tested and compared the sebum samples from the upper backs of 43 Parkinson’s patients and 21 matched healthy subjects to discover volatile organic compounds linked to disease. To investigate the aroma-causing chemicals, the researchers used a sophisticated analytical technology: thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. With it, the researchers shortened the list of Parkinson’s smell-causing candidates from the hundreds to just 17. Joy confirmed that mixing all 17 identified chemicals, or specific combinations of just nine or four, closely matched the musky fragrance she smelled on Parkinson’s patients, demonstrating that, indeed, these chemicals contribute to the unique smell associated with Parkinson’s.\n\nThis study highlights the potential of analyzing the sebum from Parkinson’s patients and raises the possibility that individuals can be screened noninvasively using a diagnostic device with a nose for these odor-based biomarkers. Such a device could allow earlier diagnosis and treatment to prevent the disease from progressing to stages with severe symptoms. However, with samples from just over 60 people, the current study is limited by sample size.The next steps are to study the sebum of more patients for an odor signature to establish a panel of odor-based biomarkers associated with Parkinson’s disease.\n\nWithout an objective test, such as a blood test or brain scan, to make a definitive diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, doctors instead look for key neurological symptoms. However, the misdiagnosis rate remains significant because the symptoms are similar to other neurological conditions, and patients cannot be treated until symptoms manifest. As the foundation of a diagnostic medical device, odorous biomarkers for Parkinson’s can open new avenues for facilitating earlier detection of the disease to prevent progressive neurodegeneration and motor symptoms, such as tremor.\n\nHowever, the concept of using disease-associated odorous biomarkers as the basis for a medical device has been simmering for nearly 40 years but has so far come up empty handed. Since the 1980s, devices called “electronic noses” that mimic the human olfactory system have been developed but have only been used for research purposes. In the future, the development of new sensors with improved sensitivity could make the electronic nose an effective clinical tool for the early detection of Parkinson’s and other health problems such as infections, tumors and exposure to toxic agents. An electronic nose with the accuracy to identify specific volatile organic compounds has the potential to yield a catalog of diagnostic odorous biomarkers for patients with diseases that cannot be diagnosed with traditional clinical tools.","title":"A New Way to Detect Parkinson’s—by Smell","origin":"Medical & Biotech","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/3C082912-2CF5-4E1A-A91593312CB883F9_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&C5CE8B11-8E6B-488B-B57327B237F951CD"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/machines-that-read-your-brain-waves/","authors":"Wade Roush","pub_date":"April 1, 2019","abstract":"Sometimes a technology that's been simmering in the laboratory or the clinic for decades makes the leap to mainstream consumption almost overnight.\n\nTake the cavity magnetron. The precursor to this curious form of vacuum tube was invented at General Electric around 1920. It wasn't until 1940 that British scientists found a magnetron design that could pump out microwave energy at unprecedented power. That discovery fueled a crash program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to build airborne radar units, an advance that helped the Allies turn back Nazi Germany in Europe. The conflict had barely ended when a Raytheon engineer noticed that microwaves could also melt chocolate. The “Radarange” debuted in 1947, and today there's a magnetron in virtually every kitchen.\n\nThe next old-but-new technology to pervade our lives may be so-called neural interfaces. Thanks to noninvasive tools that have been around for decades, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), physicians and neuroscientists can measure changes in your brain without drilling a hole in your skull. And now some of the problems that made these tools finicky, expensive and hard to interpret are being ironed out, meaning that neural interfaces are suddenly showing up at Amazon and Target. Which presents a challenge because measuring brain activity isn't like making microwave popcorn. There are enormous privacy and ethical issues at stake.\n\nThe story of Toronto-based InteraXon, a brain-machine interface start-up founded in 2007, shows how fast things are changing. Getting reliable brain-wave measurements via EEG used to mean pasting dozens of electrodes to a subject's scalp. But InteraXon built a wearable EEG device with just a few electrodes that rest against the forehead and behind the ears, along with software to classify the brain waves they measure. Low-frequency “alpha” waves indicate a relaxed state; higher-frequency “beta” or “gamma” waves indicate a busy or concentrating mind.\n\nThe company's first applications were on the whimsical side. Visitors to the Ontario pavilion at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver could don a headband and use their thoughts to control the lights shining on Niagara Falls and other distant Ontario landmarks. Later the company built thought-controlled slot cars and Star Wars games. “After all this thought controlling, we hit upon this very important recognition,” InteraXon co-founder Ariel Garten told me. “Although you could control technology with your brain, the way that you did it was not very effective. Frankly, you could just turn the thing with your hand much more readily.”\n\nBut in 2014 the company released its Muse headband, now in its second iteration: it pairs with a smartphone app to help users practice mindfulness meditation. When the software detects brain waves indicating a wandering mind, wearers hear feedback in the form of crashing waves or thunder. These sounds cue them to return their attention to their breath. “It's like doing a rep at the gym,” Garten says. “That's you saying, ‘Okay, I have this muscle called my attention, and I'm going to strengthen it.’”\n\nBut it's one thing to use EEG data to diagnose sleep disorders or epilepsy; it's quite another to start monitoring the brain states of millions of healthy consumers. So Garten also founded the Center for Responsible Brainwave Technologies, which aims to prevent privacy breaches, excessive scientific claims or other missteps that could derail the nascent neural-interfaces industry. “The goal is to create a set of standards to ensure that everybody's data is kept safe at all times and that the technology is used appropriately,” Garten says.\n\nMary Lou Jepsen is onboard with that. She's a Silicon Valley hardware engineer who recently founded Openwater, a start-up building a ski-cap-shaped device that will use skull-penetrating infrared light to measure blood flow—a sign of which brain areas are working hardest. Jepsen conceived the technology as a low-cost substitute for fMRI for diagnosing brain injuries or neurodegenerative diseases. But one day, she says, it might also be used to read thoughts.\n\nThat could be a boon for people with disabilities, but it is also a privacy nightmare in the making. “I think the mind-reading scenarios are farther out, but the reason I'm talking about them early is because they do have profound ethical and legal implications,” Jepsen says. “The only way we're going to release something is if we have ways to define what it means to be responsible.”\n\nAs with so many other technologies, consumer neural interfaces seem destined to reach consumers before they're fully cooked. For now they'll be best served with a healthy side of caution.","title":"Machines That Read Your Brain Waves","origin":"Medical & Biotech","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/DAADA214-9E5B-41EF-A754B12D535B22E8_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&96A8ABEB-2F56-4614-97A5F95F9CC2E390"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/building-a-brain-implant-for-smell/","authors":"Karen Weintraub","pub_date":"April 1, 2019","abstract":"When Scott Moorehead tells people he cannot smell, they usually make a joke about how lucky he is—he must not be troubled by dirty diapers or people passing gas. “All the jokes are hilarious,” Moorehead says, with a hint of sarcasm. But his lack of smell also means he is vulnerable to natural gas leaks and burning food. He is self-conscious about his own scent, so he takes extra showers. And he has had to give up one of his favorite hobbies: matching wines with exotic flavors.\n\nAfter a concussion left Moorehead without a sense of smell six years ago, these losses were all he could think about. “Just knowing that I was never going to be able to smell my wife again or my kids” was hard to cope with, he says.\n\nAlthough the nerves that control smell can often regrow after an injury—they are some of the only neurons known to rapidly replace themselves—Moorehead's lesion was too severe. He now has anosmia, which means his sense of smell is gone. But he is participating in a nascent effort at the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) School of Medicine and Harvard Medical School to develop a partially implantable device that could help people with brain injuries decode and interpret everyday scents.\n\nResearch on smell lags decades behind that on vision and hearing, says Joel Mainland, an olfactory neuroscientist and associate member of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, who is not involved in the new work. Smell studies receive less funding than research on other senses does, he says. And smell involves many sensory components. Whereas vision requires interpreting input from three types of receptors, taste involves 40 and olfaction 400.\n\nA surprisingly large number of people have an impaired sense of smell—23 percent of U.S. adults age 40 and older, according to one national survey, and 62.5 percent of those age 80 and older, according to another. Such a decline can result from injury, chronic sinus problems, genetics or aging, says VCU professor Richard Costanzo, who has studied smell for four decades and is co-leading the initiative to develop the new device. Often dismissed as inconsequential, smell contributes to taste, so people who cannot smell are at risk for malnutrition, as well as social isolation, Costanzo says.\n\nSome smell-restoration treatments exist, Mainland says, including smell training, in which people repeatedly expose themselves to certain odors and practice identifying them. Other treatments may uncover specific causes of smell loss, such as chronic sinusitis. But for someone with the damage Moorehead suffered, none of these is effective.\n\nSmell, like all senses, is a multistep process. Scents, technically called odorant molecules, enter through the nose or mouth and pass through a layer of mucus before binding to olfactory receptor neurons. This binding triggers electrical signals that reach certain spots in the brain's olfactory bulb. “One nerve cell may respond to a brownie but not to pound cake, and its neighbor might do the opposite,” says Eric Holbrook, chief of rhinology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. “One nerve cell probably responds to multiple chemicals, but they have some specificity.”\n\nHolbrook, who is collaborating with the VCU team, is now trying to find a shortcut to stimulate the brain's olfactory bulb and then trigger a sensation of smell. Ultimately the researchers plan to create a device that will operate somewhat like a cochlear implant, an electronic device that partially restores hearing. Cochlear implants turn sounds into electrical signals that the brain interprets; in a similar way, the VCU-Harvard team hopes to convert chemical scents into useful electrical signals. Holbrook published a study in February in the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology suggesting that electrical stimulation in the nasal cavity and sinuses can make a healthy person perceive an odor, even if it is not present. That is a long way from restoring a sense of smell in someone who has lost it, but it is an important step along the way, Holbrook says.\n\nA cochlear implant has an external sound processor worn behind the ear that includes a microphone and microcomputer. That component transmits signals to an internal piece under the skin that stimulates nerves in the cochlea, the organ that converts sound vibrations into nerve impulses. Similarly, the VCU-Harvard team envisions a device that would potentially fit under the nose—or on a pair of glasses—and include an odor sensor and a small external microprocessor, as well as an internal part to stimulate different areas of the olfactory bulb, Costanzo says.\n\nDaniel Coelho, a cochlear implant surgeon at VCU who is collaborating with Costanzo, says the researchers must still refine sensors so they can discriminate among enough odors to be useful. The plan is to miniaturize and expedite smell processing such as that carried out by so-called electronic noses, which are used for bomb detection and identification of spoiled food. In addition, researchers must determine the optimal surgical approaches to safely implant a device that can stimulate the brain to perceive smells.\n\nDeveloping such an olfactory implant will take years, Coelho says, but it is not impossible. “It's a pretty straightforward idea. We're not inventing anything radically new,” he notes. Rather the team is putting existing technology together in a new way.\n\nMoorehead, who injured himself falling off a skateboard while trying to teach his then six-year-old how to ride, is not optimistic about regaining his sense of smell. But he could not pass up the opportunity to help others, including the researchers. “It just kept seeming painfully obvious,” Moorehead says, “that this is what I'm supposed to do.”","title":"Building a Brain Implant for Smell","origin":"Neuroscience","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/C80C263F-EE01-4DFC-A952290E95DE606C_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&6ACC92B7-871B-47A3-83381DE0556FDD1A"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pig-experiment-challenges-assumptions-around-brain-damage-in-people/","authors":"Stuart Youngner, Insoo Hyun, Nature magazine","pub_date":"April 17, 2019","abstract":"In this week’s Nature, researchers describe restoring certain structural and functional properties to pigs’ brains, even four hours after the animals had been killed. They used an artificial perfusion system called BrainEx.\n\nElectrophysiological monitoring did not detect any kind of neural activity thought to signal consciousness, such as any evidence of signalling between brain regions (see ‘Between life and death’). Nonetheless, the study challenges the long-held assumption that large mammalian brains are irreversibly damaged a few minutes after blood stops circulating. It also raises the possibility that researchers could get better at salvaging a person’s brain even after the heart and lungs have stopped working.\n\nAdvances following on from the BrainEx study could exacerbate tensions between efforts to save the lives of individuals and attempts to obtain organs to donate to others. (Such advances could also affect the use of human brains and brain tissue in research.)\n\nIn our view, as the science of brain resuscitation progresses, some efforts to save or restore people’s brains might seem increasingly reasonable—and some decisions to forego such attempts in favour of procuring organs for transplantation might seem less so.\n\n\nBETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH\n\nHow were some cellular functions and structures restored to pig brains hours after the animals had been killed?\n\nThe researchers (largely at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut) used around 300 pig heads from a US Department of Agriculture abattoir1. After optimizing the technology, the team connected 32 pig brains to the BrainEx system (4 hours after the pigs had been killed, and after removing the brains from the skulls). This computerized network of pumps, heaters and filters controlled the flow, temperature and constituents of a proprietary perfusate solution for six hours.\n\n\n\nThere was no evidence of the kind of neural activity that is thought to signal consciousness, or the ability to perceive the environment and experience sensations such as pain or distress. But, incredibly, BrainEx did restore and sustain circulation to major arteries, small blood vessels and capillaries, cellular responsiveness to drugs and cerebral metabolism. A drug that increases blood flow in people’s brains, for instance, dilated pig blood vessels and increased the rate of flow of the perfusate.\n\n\n\nSome large-scale anatomical and small-scale morphological features were restored and preserved, thanks to a reduction in swelling and other changes that would otherwise have led to cell damage and cell death. Electrodes inserted into slices of brain tissue (cultured in standard medium) detected electrical activity in individual neurons; neurons fired action potentials in response to an electrical stimulus and even displayed spontaneous synaptic activity. All of this was detected at normal body temperature.\n\n\n\nIt is not known how long uninterrupted perfusion could have sustained these functions. The team stopped the experiment after six hours, mainly because of the limited availability of fresh perfusate and the difficulties of having someone continually monitor and adjust the BrainEx system.\n\n\n\nThe study was designed to investigate whether any physiological and cellular functions can be restored in a large, intact mammalian brain several hours after death. Such work could, in principle, help investigators to develop therapies for brain injuries resulting from a lack of oxygen, and even enable the study of intact human brains.\n\n\nThe transplant community, neuroscientists, emergency medical personnel and other stakeholders must debate the issues. Eventually, it might be useful for groups such as the US National Academy of Medicine to offer guidelines for physicians and hospitals. These would help to protect the interests of individuals for whom sufficient recovery is a possibility, as well as the interests of potential organ recipients.\n\nDetermination of death\n\nFor decades, bioethicists and transplantation-policy researchers have had to wrestle with the question of when to switch from trying to save someone’s life to trying to save their organs for the benefit of another person.\n\nInvariably, this comes down to a moral decision—namely about futility, which is a contentious and value-laden concept. There are few data to support decisions. And clinicians disagree about when there is a chance of recovery. There is also little consensus on what level of recovery is ‘good enough’ from the perspective of patients and their families, as well as when these factors are weighed against limited medical resources.\n\nIn most countries, a person can be legally declared dead if they show irreversible loss of all brain function (brain death) or irreversible loss of all circulatory function (circulatory death).\n\nIn recent decades, most organs for transplant have been taken from those who have been declared brain dead, often after a catastrophic brain injury resulting from a stroke, trauma or prolonged lack of oxygen to the brain, caused for instance by drowning. (In these cases, the person’s heart and lung functions are maintained in the intensive care unit.)\n\nIncreasingly, however, those who are declared dead after their hearts and lungs have stopped working are being deemed eligible for organ donation. This shift has largely been driven by an increased need for organs as transplantation surgeries have become more successful. According to the US non-profit organization the United Network for Organ Sharing, someone is added to the US transplant waiting list every ten minutes. In 2017, around 18 people in the United States died every day while waiting for a transplant.\n\nIf technologies similar to BrainEx are improved and developed for use in humans, people who are declared brain dead (especially those with brain injuries resulting from a lack of oxygen) could become candidates for brain resuscitation rather than organ donation. Certainly, it could become harder for physicians or family members to be convinced that further medical intervention is futile.\n\nFor people who have been declared dead on the basis of circulatory criteria, matters could become even more complex.\n\nToday, there are two main protocols for obtaining organs in these cases. One occurs in individuals who have severe brain injuries but are not brain dead. It is called controlled donation after circulatory determination of death (controlled DCDD).\n\nHere, after carers obtain consent, they switch off the person’s mechanical ventilator and any other life support that might be in use in the operating room. The patient is then declared dead 2–5 minutes after their heart stops beating. Because adequate testing for brain death is impossible in the race to obtain healthy organs, it is assumed that the individual has had an irreversible loss of brain function.\n\nThe second protocol (uncontrolled DCDD) is practised mainly in Europe. It generally occurs after a person has had a heart attack in a non-medical setting. In these cases, after paramedics have declared resuscitative efforts futile, nothing is done for around 5–20 minutes. Next, steps are taken to try to preserve the organs. These might include resuming cardiopulmonary resuscitation to restore circulation; introducing cooling fluids through an artery in the groin; or even a technique that oxygenates the blood and pumps it throughout the body (known as extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO).\n\nEven now, clinicians and bioethicists disagree over how long is long enough for paramedics to keep trying to resuscitate. Practitioners use various rules of thumb, such as ‘declare death after 30 minutes of unsuccessful resuscitative efforts’, and can refer to published guidelines. But as the US neurologist James Bernat has pointed out, such rules “are difficult to apply in practice because each CPR is a unique event with different variables”. Data are scant, but one study of people who died of heart attacks in hospitals in the United States found that patients were declared dead with more certainty after longer resuscitative efforts.\n\nQuestions about the term ‘irreversible’ haunt both protocols. Does this mean that the care team is unable to reverse a situation, or that they have reasonably decided not to attempt to? Unsurprisingly, most advocates for transplantation favour the latter view. Some have even argued that further efforts to restore people’s brains at the expense of organ procurement would divert much-needed medical resources and potentially increase the number of people with severe disabilities.\n\nHeightening the tension are concerns among bioethicists and medical practitioners that brain function could be recovered in some bodies that have been put on ECMO. Some organ-recovery teams in the United States and Taiwan have tried to prevent this by inserting a thoracic aortic occlusion balloon to stop the pumped blood from reaching the brain. This intervention was deemed a “serious problem” by a US Department of Health and Human Services panel because it raises “causation questions about physicians’ active complicity in the patient’s death”.\n\nLastly, there is considerable variation between countries about what is morally and legally acceptable. In France and Spain, ECMO equipment can be transported in a special ambulance to wherever the patient is. In the United States, the technique is controversial and rarely used.\n\nThese debates and decisions could become much more fraught if advances in research challenge assumptions about the brain’s inability to recover from an absence of oxygen, or even just hint at the possibility that consciousness can be restored after a person’s heart has stopped beating. Ultimately, more people could become candidates for brain resuscitation rather than for organ donation.\n\nHealthy debate\n\nBalancing the competing interests of developments in resuscitation and transplantation comes down to values, as well as science. Different people have different ideas about how to best save and improve lives.\n\nIn our view, the BrainEx study, and the follow-up work it will surely inspire, flag the need for more open discussion. Debate involving everyone—from neuroscientists and policymakers to patients and medical personnel—could help to clarify which criteria make someone eligible for organ donation versus resuscitation. Such discussions can also explore how to ensure that organ donation can be integrated into end-of-life care with minimal controversy.\n\nTwo institutions are well placed to take the lead and bring the relevant stakeholders together: the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the UK Nuffield Council on Bioethics. Both have held public meetings and produced multidisciplinary reports on controversial areas of science, medicine and ethics for decades. In 2006, for example, workshops held over a year involving researchers, health-care professionals and comments from the public led to an NAS report evaluating various proposals to increase organ donations, and their potential impact on people from minority ethnic groups and those who are socio-economically disadvantaged.\n\nResearchers are a long way from being able to restore structures and functions in the brains of people who would today be declared dead. But, in our view, it is not too early to consider how this type of research could affect the growing population of critically ill patients who are waiting for kidneys, livers, lungs or hearts.\n\nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on April 17, 2019.","title":"Pig Experiment Challenges Assumptions around Brain Damage in People","origin":"Neuroscience","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/A3FDC4F4-F970-4A6E-9FECC8A5F893E996_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&A592D796-51FA-4483-AAB969F709887D84"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/part-revived-pig-brains-raise-slew-of-ethical-quandaries/","authors":"Nita A.

The researchers saw circulation in major arteries and small blood vessels, metabolism and responsiveness to drugs at the cellular level and even spontaneous synaptic activity in neurons, among other things. The team formulated a unique solution and circulated it through the isolated brains using a network of pumps and filters called BrainEx. The solution was cell-free, did not coagulate and contained a haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier and a wide range of pharmacological agents.\n\nThe remarkable study, published in this week’s Nature, offers the promise of an animal or even human whole-brain model in which many cellular functions are intact. At present, cells from animal and human brains can be sustained in culture for weeks, but only so much can be gleaned from isolated cells. Tissue slices can provide snapshots of local structural organization, yet they are woefully inadequate for questions about function and global connectivity, because much of the 3D structure is lost during tissue preparation.\n\nThe work also raises a host of ethical issues. There was no evidence of any global electrical activity—the kind of higher-order brain functioning associated with consciousness. Nor was there any sign of the capacity to perceive the environment and experience sensations. Even so, because of the possibilities it opens up, the BrainEx study highlights potential limitations in the current regulations for animals used in research.\n\nMost fundamentally, in our view, it throws into question long-standing assumptions about what makes an animal—or a human—alive.\n\nSigns of what?\n\nThe pig brains used in the study, which was conducted by a team based largely at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, produced a flat line on an electroencephalogram (EEG) of brain activity. Had any degree of sentience been recovered, let alone consciousness, one would expect to see low-amplitude waves in the alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) range, at the very least. In consultations with the Neuroethics Working Group of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) BRAIN Initiative and in discussions with us, the researchers have stated that if they had detected such activity, they would have administered anaesthetic agents to prevent any experience similar to pain or distress, and would have reduced the brain temperature to swiftly quell the activity.\n\n\n\nAbsence of organized electrical electrical brain activity, measured with an EEG, is one measure used to establish brain death. Credit: Kateryna Kon Getty Images\n\n\n\nResearchers already study whole organs, and maintain cellular activity for a few seconds to minutes in slices of animal and human brains. Thus, on the face of it, in the absence of EEG activity, the BrainEx study does not raise fundamentally different issues from those encountered in the use of animal or human brain tissue after death.\n\nYet, until now, neuroscientists and others have assumed two things. First, that neural activity and consciousness are irretrievably lost within seconds to minutes of interrupting blood flow in mammalian brains. Second, that, unless circulation is quickly restored, there is a largely irreversible progression towards cell death and the death of the organism.\n\nThe BrainEx study used pig brains that had received no oxygen, glucose or other nutrients for four hours. As such, it opens up possibilities that were previously unthinkable.\n\nTake the lack of EEG activity. This activity could have been lost irreversibly when the pigs were slaughtered. Another possibility, however, is that the lack of EEG activity was a function of the study design. The researchers used several chemical agents in their solution that inhibit neural activity, hypothesizing that the tissues would be more likely to show some recovery if cellular activity were reduced. Had these blockers been removed at some point, perhaps the team would have detected EEG activity.\n\nAnother possibility needing investigation is that something similar to shock treatment for the heart is required to reset the firing of neurons in the brain to a level that is detectable. Or maybe it takes longer than six hours (the length of the BrainEx perfusion, following the four hours after death) for the cells to recover sufficiently for this kind of brain activity to emerge. Physicians sometimes lower the core body temperatures of people who have had a heart attack, to induce a hypothermic coma. This can limit damage caused by swelling in the brain, for instance, and aid cellular recovery. In these cases, patients seem to need at least 24 hours of ‘cooling treatment’.\n\nObviously, more data are needed, including the replication of the BrainEx findings in other laboratories by other groups. But we’re reminded of a line from the 1987 film The Princess Bride: “There’s a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive.” Even with all the unknowns, the discovery that mammalian brains can be made to seem ‘slightly alive’, hours after the animals had been killed, has implications that ethicists, regulators and society more broadly must now think through.\n\nAnimal research\n\nTo be clear, the BrainEx study did not breach any ethical guidelines for research. The team sought guidance from Yale University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which exists to ensure that the use of animals aligns with what is required by US law for federally funded research. The committee decided that oversight was unnecessary. The pigs, having been raised as livestock, were exempt from animal welfare laws and were killed before the study started. In the United States, the 1966 Animal Welfare Act is the only federal law that regulates how animals are treated in research, and applies to either living or dead animals. It explicitly excludes animals raised for food. Meanwhile, the policies and regulations of the US Public Health Service, which funds most US research involving animals—mainly through the NIH—do not specify any protections for animals after their death.\n\nHad the research been conducted outside the United States, the response from ethics or regulatory bodies would almost certainly have been the same. The European Union’s Directive on the Protection of Animals Used for Scientific Purposes largely aims to prevent (or minimize) any pain, suffering or distress experienced by live animals. It, too, specifically excludes animals raised for agriculture (see go.nature.com/2cpdgjr). In China, both the Ministry of Science and Technology and the provincial bureaus of science and technology ensure that researchers follow local regulations and that they abide by the National Standard on Laboratory Animal Welfare in China. Here, too, the protections exclude animals raised for food, and the main focus is on eliminating or reducing live animals’ potential pain and distress.\n\nIn our view, new guidelines are needed for studies involving the preservation or restoration of whole brains, because animals used for such research could end up in a grey area—not alive, but not completely dead. Five issues in particular need addressing.\n\nFirst, how should researchers try to detect signs of consciousness or sentience? On its own, EEG activity would not reliably signal a conscious brain; such activity is nearly always detected in people who are under general anaesthesia. EEG activity might provide an appropriate measure should it be detected along with responsiveness to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)—a non-invasive way of stimulating brain activity, using a magnetic coil held near the head. Together with other measures, this would determine the brain’s perturbational complexity index, a way of identifying the level of consciousness. Furthermore, recent research in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging indicates that certain patterns of neuronal activity may provide a correlate for consciousness.\n\nSecond, which species make appropriate models for this type of research on brain perfusion? And what kinds of research and results would be needed to justify the use of other models? (In our view, investigators should proceed cautiously with testing in other mammals, particularly in pigs, dogs or primates, at this time.)\n\nThird, until more is known, is the use of neuronal activity blockers sufficient to safeguard against the emergence of capabilities associated with sentience, such as the capacity to feel pain? It might be necessary to apply BrainEx or similar systems to mice or rats, both with and without neuronal activity blockers, to better understand the blockers’ role.\n\nFourth, under which scenarios should anaesthetics be used in follow-on studies, to safeguard against the possibility of inducing any experience similar to pain or distress? And under what scenarios might it be permissible not to use them? (We think that the use of anaesthetics in follow-on studies should be mandatory at this time, given all of the unknowns.)\n\nFinally, for how long should BrainEx or similar artificial circulatory systems be run? Such systems might be effective for only a certain period of time, or there could be a limit as to how much recovery can be achieved. This knowledge will inform analyses of risks and benefits.\n\nHuman research\n\nAlthough it is a long way off, researchers might one day consider using a system similar to BrainEx to treat humans for brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen. Until now, neuroscientists and physicians have assumed that the cell death caused by this is irreversible. Treatment generally involves working with a person’s remaining healthy brain tissue to help rehabilitate mobility, motor and other skills.\n\nBefore developing whole human-brain models outside the body—and certainly before the use of brain perfusion in the clinic—investigators need to arm people with enough information for them to make informed decisions. Most fundamentally, patients or donors will need to understand what kinds of brain activity could result and what that activity could mean. They will also need to know the chances of recovery being only partial, and the implications that will have.\n\nAnother question is what information, if any, could plausibly be retrieved from the brain. Various groups are developing ways to decode the neural activity of living people, for instance to probe their memories or the images they have seen in their dreams. Could such approaches one day be applied to brains after death?\n\nSuch possibilities (if they come to pass at all) are far in the future. Yet we need to think through at least some of them now. Hundreds of people worldwide have already paid to have their brains frozen and stored, in the hope that scientists will one day be able to revive them. It’s easy to imagine misapplications of brain perfusion following the publication of the BrainEx study alone.\n\nGuidelines\n\nIt might not be easy for others to replicate the study, despite the BrainEx team providing detailed information on the device, perfusate and methods. As a first step, the investigators, their home institutions and the NIH should facilitate the transfer of the technology and know-how to other researchers and institutions. Any follow-up and independent studies should be just as transparent as this one.\n\nCrucially, future researchers will need guidance through the potential scientific, ethical and political questions opened up by this research.\n\nPrecedents exist. Internationally, research involving stem cells derived from human embryos has successfully been steered by the 2005 Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research released by the US Institute of Medicine and US National Research Council—the substance of which was almost entirely adopted by the International Society for Stem Cell Research. Ongoing efforts to set guidelines for human genome-editing research hold lessons, too. Key actors here are the US National Academy of Sciences, the US National Academy of Medicine, the UK Royal Society, the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics.\n\nIn other contexts, such as in biomedical engineering (see, for example, go.nature.com/2t6kon5), artificial intelligence and debates around the definition of death, international conferences are being held to help find common ground across countries and to develop frameworks that enable responsible scientific progress.\n\nWe think that the latest research on brain resuscitation demands the same kind of international attention. A starting point could be the guiding principles issued last December by the Neuroethics Working Group of the NIH BRAIN Initiative, which held a 2018 workshop on research with human neural tissue.\n\nCitizens must be part of the process. Engaging non-scientists in delineating the ethical boundaries of this research doesn’t guarantee its public acceptance in the future; and nor should it, necessarily. But not engaging other stakeholders could help to precipitate its rejection.\n\nIn our view, discussion about the appropriate path for this research should not wait for follow-up studies. The Yale group was conscientious and consulted the local institutional IACUC, Yale bioethicists, NIH programme officers and even the NIH Neuroethics Working Group. The researchers did what they could, and probably more than many would have done, to ensure that they were acting appropriately in a void of ethical analysis on the issue.\n\nNow is the time to fill that void.\n\nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on April 17, 2019.","title":"Part-Revived Pig Brains Raise Slew of Ethical Quandaries","origin":"Policy & Ethics","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/813A56BD-EC05-48B6-87F6CC47D74F9AD3_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&127D0561-E7EA-4FE7-8D9B925037ECA23C"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-tool-could-help-diagnose-alzheimers/","authors":"Rod McCullom","pub_date":"","abstract":"An estimated 5.7 million people in the U.S. have Alzheimer’s disease—the most common type of dementia—and that number is expected to more than double by 2050. Early diagnosis is crucial for patients to benefit from the few therapies available. But no single assay or scan can deliver a conclusive diagnosis while a person is alive; instead doctors have to conduct numerous clinical and neuropsychological tests. So there is growing interest in developing artificial intelligence to identify Alzheimer’s based on brain imaging.","title":"AI Tool Could Help Diagnose Alzheimer's","origin":"Scientific American May 2019"},{"link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pausing-fertility-what-will-happen-when-the-eggs-thaw/","authors":"Liza Mundy","pub_date":"","abstract":"Sprightly yellow seems to be the hue of choice for corporate wellness chains designing a logo to attract health-minded women.

In the early 2000s American geneticist Michael Zasloff of Georgetown University had traveled to the University of St. Andrews to give a talk about several natural antibiotics found in animal skin. After the lecture, he and some of the university scientists went for a drink, and one of them, a marine biologist, began to talk about how dolphins were frequently savaged by sharks, sustaining some bite wounds 45 centimeters long and 12 centimeters deep. But remarkably the dolphins healed up in weeks, with no signs of infection.","title":"A Drug Shows an Astonishing Ability to Regenerate Damaged Hearts and Other Body Parts","origin":"Scientific American April 2019"}]
