The Cochard and Sperry rotors are both incapable of measuring the VCs of species with long vessels because of the premature embolism induced by hypothetical nanoparticles that can be drawn into segments during flow measurement. In contrast, water extraction pushes nanoparticles out of the sample. This study focuses on a long-vessel species, Robinia pseudoacacia L., for which many VCs have been constructed by different methods, and the daily water relations have been quantified. PLV extraction curves have dual Weibull curves, and this paper focuses on the second Weibull curve because it involves the extraction of water from vessels, as proven by the staining methods. We demonstrate a water extraction method after evaporation correction that has 0.5% accuracy, shows good agreement with two traditional methods, which are slower and less accurate, and is immune to nanoparticle artefacts. Using Poiseuille’s law and the geometry of vessels, we argue that PLC = 2PLV-PLV2 in a special case where all vessels, regardless of size, have the same vulnerability curve. In this special case, this equation predicts the data reasonably well.","authors":"Guoquan Peng, Dongmei Yang, Zhao Liang, Junhui Li, Melvin T Tyree","keywords":"water extraction, vulnerability curves, nanoparticles, Robinia pseudoacacia","pub_date":"06 May 2019","title":"The quantitative relationship between water extraction curves and vulnerability curves in the long-vessel species Robinia pseudoacacia L"},{"link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jxb/erz207/5485872?searchresult=1","origin":"Accepted Manuscript","abstract":"Lateral root (LR) proliferation is a major determinant of soil nutrient uptake. How resource allocation controls the extent of LR growth remains unresolved. We used genetic, physiological, transcriptomic and grafting approaches to define a role for C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE RECEPTOR 1 (CEPR1) in controlling sucrose-dependent LR growth. CEPR1 inhibited LR growth in response to applied sucrose, other metabolisable sugars, and high light intensity. Pathways through CEPR1 restricted LR growth by reducing LR meristem size and the length of mature LR cells. RNA-sequencing of WT and cepr1-1 roots with or without sucrose treatment revealed an intersection of CEP-CEPR1 signalling with the sucrose transcriptional response. Sucrose upregulated several CEP genes, supporting a specific role for CEP-CEPR1 in the response to sucrose. Moreover, genes with basally perturbed expression in cepr1-1 overlap with WT sucrose-responsive genes significantly. We found that exogenous CEP peptide inhibited LR growth via CEPR1 by reducing LR meristem size and mature cell length. This result is consistent with CEP-CEPR1 acting to curtail the extent of sucrose-dependent LR growth. Reciprocal grafting indicates LR growth inhibition requires CEPR1 in both the roots and shoots. Our results reveal a new role for CEP-CEPR1 signalling in controlling LR growth in response to sucrose.","authors":"Kelly Chapman, Michael Taleski, Huw A Ogilvie, Nijat Imin, Michael A Djordjevic","keywords":"Arabidopsis, carbon availability, CEP, CEPR1, growth, lateral root, peptide hormone, sucrose","pub_date":"06 May 2019","title":"CEP-CEPR1 signalling inhibits the sucrose-dependent enhancement of lateral root growth"},{"link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jxb/erz208/5485895?searchresult=1","origin":"Accepted Manuscript","abstract":"Decreases in the photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance (gs), and mesophyll conductance (gm) are often observed under elevated CO2 conditions.

However, contrary to animals plants have the ability to generate new organs throughout their whole life. These give them an extraordinary developmental plasticity to modulate their size and architecture according to environmental constraints and opportunities. How this plasticity is regulated at the whole organism level is elusive. Here we provide evidence for a role of Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein (TCTP) in regulating the iterative formation of lateral roots in Arabidopsis. AtTCTP1 modulates root system architecture through a dual function: as a general constitutive growth promoter enhancing root elongation, and as a systemic signalling agent via mobility in the vasculature. AtTCTP1 encodes mRNAs with long distance mobility between shoot and roots. Mobile shoot-derived TCTP1 gene products act to specifically enhance the frequency of lateral root initiation and emergence sites along the primary root pericycle, while root elongation is controlled by local constitutive TCTP1 expression and scion size. These findings uncover a novel type of integrative signal in the control lateral root initiation and the compromise for roots between branching more profusely or elongating further. They also provide the first evidence in plants of an extra-cellular function of the vital, highly expressed ubiquitous TCTP1.","authors":"Rémi Branco, Josette Masle","keywords":"TCTP, Translationally Controlled Tumor protein, long-distance mobility, root development, lateral root initiation, root system architecture, grafts, scion control of rootstock development","pub_date":"30 April 2019","title":"Systemic signalling through TCTP1 controls lateral root formation in Arabidopsis"},{"link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jxb/erz200/5481731?searchresult=1","origin":"Accepted Manuscript","abstract":"The physiological constraints on bud burst in woody perennials, including vascular development and oxygenation remain unresolved. Both light and tissue oxygen status have emerged as important cues for vascular development in other systems, however, grapevine buds have only a facultative light requirement, and data on the tissue oxygen status has been confounded by the spatial variability within the bud. Here, we analysed apoplastic development at early stages of grapevine bud burst and combined molecular modelling with histochemical techniques to determine the pore size of cell walls in grapevine buds. The data demonstrate that quiescent grapevine buds were impermeable to apoplastic dyes (acid fuchsin and eosin Y) until after bud burst was established. The molecular exclusion size was calculated to be 2.1 nm, which would exclude most macromolecules except simple sugars and phytohormones until after bud burst. We used micro-computed tomography to demonstrate that tissue oxygen partial pressure data correlated well with structural heterogeneity of the bud, and differences in tissue density, confirming that the primary bud complex becomes rapidly and preferentially oxygenated during bud burst. Taken together, this reveals that the apoplastic porosity is highly regulated during the early stages of bud burst, and suggests a role for vascular development in the initial, rapid oxygenation of the primary bud complex.","authors":"Santiago Signorelli, Jeremy Shaw, Dina Hermawaty, Zi Wang, Pieter Verboven, John A Considine, Michael J Considine","keywords":"Apoplast, Bud, Bud burst, DFT, Dormancy, Grapevine, Light, Oxygen, Hypoxia, Development, Computed Tomography","pub_date":"30 April 2019","title":"The initiation of bud burst in grapevine features dynamic regulation of the apoplastic pore size"},{"link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jxb/erz202/5481765?searchresult=1","origin":"Accepted Manuscript","abstract":"Transgenic technology was developed to introduce transgenes into various organisms to validate gene function and add genetic variations over 40 years ago.

The mostly expanded DHSs are often substructured into several individual THSs, which correlate with phylogenetically conserved DNA sequences or enhancer elements. Comparing chromatin accessibility with available RNA-seq data, THS change configuration is reflected by gene activation or repression and chromatin regions acquire or lose transposase accessibility in direct correlation with gene expression levels in LOFCs. This is most pronounced immediately upstream of the transcription start, where genome-wide THSs are abundant in a complementary pattern to established H3K4me3 activation or H3K27me3 repression marks.

Near-isogenic lines (NILs) and a map-based approach were employed to clone the LGS1 locus.

The LGS1 transcript levels in the mutant line were found to be higher than the lgs1 transcript levels in the control plants, suggesting that the mutation might disrupt the pairing of the LGS1 mRNA with miR396. In addition to producing larger grains, LGS1 also enhanced cold tolerance at the seedling stage and increased the survival rate of seedlings after cold stress treatment.

Both enzymes are transiently persulfidated in their reaction cycle, i.e. the abstracted sulfur atom is bound to a reactive cysteine residue in the form of a persulfide group. Trans-persulfidation reactions occur when sulfur atoms are transferred to nucleophilic acceptors such as glutathione, proteins or small metabolites. STRs form a ubiquitous, multigenic protein family.

This review focuses on the complexity of interactions occurring between S and other nutrients, and these are addressed at the levels of the whole plant, individual tissues and cellular compartments. With regards to macronutrients, S deficiency mainly acts by reducing plant growth, which in turn restricts the root uptake of N, K, and Mg, for example, and vice versa. TOR protein kinase, whose involvement in the co-regulation of C/N and S metabolism has been recently unravelled, provides a clue to understanding the links between S and plant growth. In legumes, the original crosstalks between N and S can be found at the level of nodules, which show high requirements for S, and hence specifically express a number of sulfate transporters. With regards to the micronutrients, their uptake except for Fe can be increased under S deficiency through various mechanisms. One of these results from the broad specificity of root sulfate transporters up-regulated during S deficiency, which can also take up some molybdate and selenate. A second mechanism is linked to the large accumulation of sulfate in the leaf vacuoles, so that its reduced osmotic contribution under S deficiency can be compensated for by an increase in Cl uptake and accumulation. A third group of broader mechanisms that can explain at least some of the interactions between S and micronutrients concerns metabolic networks where several nutrients are essential, such as i) the synthesis of the Mo cofactor needed by some essential enzymes, requiring S, Fe, Zn and Cu for its synthesis or ii) the synthesis and regulation of Fe-S clusters. Finally, recent developments in the modelling of S responses in crops (allocation amongst plant parts and distribution of mineral vs organic forms) are briefly presented to provide perspectives on prediction-based approaches taking into account the interactions with other minerals such as N.","authors":"Galatéa Courbet, Karine Gallardo, Gianpiero Vigani, Sophie Brunel Muguet, Jacques Trouverie, Christophe Salon, Alain Ourry","keywords":"Ionome, Ionomic signature, Molybdenum, Selenium, Sulfur, Copper, Iron, Chlorine","pub_date":"05 May 2019","title":"Disentangling the complexity and diversity of crosstalks between S and other mineral nutrients in cultivated plants"},{"link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jxb/erz195/5479476?searchresult=1","origin":"Accepted Manuscript","abstract":"As obligate parasites, plant viruses usually hijack host cytoskeletons for replication and movement.
