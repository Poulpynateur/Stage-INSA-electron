[{"abstract":"Top CRISPR researchers at two University of California (UC) campuses have teamed up with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to form a new laboratory in San Francisco that will exploit the genome editor to screen for new drugs.\n\nDrawing on a GSK commitment of $67 million over 5 years, UC Berkeley’s Jennifer Doudna, a co-inventor of the powerful CRISPR tool, and UC San Francisco’s Jonathan Weismann will select the academic talent to work in the new Laboratory for Genomics Research (LGR). “This is really, for us as academics, kind of a dream come true,” says Doudna.\n\nAlthough Doudna already has co-founded two CRISPR-related companies and co-runs the Innovative Genomic Institute with Weissman, she says the LGR “takes the not very interesting parts of the screening efforts out of the picture.” A friend who visited her lab a few years ago described it as “artisanal,” she recalls, and wondered why they weren’t using more automation. “It was a nice way of saying that it seems really fusty,” says Doudna. She hopes the LGR will let them use “genome editing and CRISPR, in particular, as a tool to understand the causes of disease in a way that had really never been possible in the past.”, Weissman, a physicist who morphed into a protein-folding specialist, specializes in using CRISPR to construct large-scale probes of gene functions. “We don’t have the capability, the knowledge, or the resources to develop drugs,” he says. “I'm trying to understand what are the problems that [GSK is] facing and what are the tools that would really solve the problem. As a tool builder, my biggest fear is we build a bridge to nowhere.”\n\nIn all, the London-based GSK will fund 24 full-time UC research¬ers—only some of whom will come from Doudna and Weissman’s labs. GSK will contribute as many as 14 of its own employees. UC will own the intellectual property (IP) of any new tools invented in the lab, while GSK hopes to patent new drug targets. UC will receive a “financial benefit if a drug that requires licensed IP comes to market,” says a GSK spokesperson, noting that the exact terms are “confidential.”\n\nHal Barron, GSK’s chief scientific officer says 90% of genes still have opaque functions. He hopes that by using CRISPR to knock out or turn on genes in cells and animal models, the LGR will be able to double the number of genes with known functions.  “Think about the impact of that as being able to develop twice as many drugs,” Barron says.\n\nOther academics who have had similar partnerships said they are useful, but can be tricky as well. “Overall, the model is great and the [CRISPR] space is ripe for innovation that’s not fundamental biology or chemistry but an engineering problem,” says UC San Francisco’s Jeffrey Bluestone, an immunologist who for the past 9 years has taken part in a collaboration between the school and Pfizer. The one challenge, he said, is there can be a “disconnect” when there’s a discovery about a potential drug that targets a disease not in the company’s portfolio.\n\nThe Harvard Stem Cell Institute took part in a collaboration with GSK between 2008 and 2013 to develop new drug targets for regenerative medicine. “It was a really great interaction,” says Harvard stem cell biologist David Scadden, who notes it ended because GSK got out of the regenerative medicine business. “Having academics who are bilingual in terms of understanding how companies have to think as they develop products is a good thing,” he says.\n\nThe lab, located at UC San Francisco’s Mission Bay campus, already is up and running.","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/CRISPR_16x9_0.jpg?itok=P2K_W4KB","title":"University of California CRISPR researchers form drug discovery alliance with pharma giant","authors":"Jon Cohen","pub_date":"Jun. 13, 2019 , 6:15 AM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/university-california-crispr-researchers-form-drug-discovery-alliance-pharma-giant"}]
