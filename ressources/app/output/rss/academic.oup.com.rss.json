Whether early vigour can lead to improved water use efficiency and crop yields is strongly dependent on climate and management conditions across the entire growing season. Here, we present a modelling framework for simulating the impact of early vigour on wheat growth and yield at eight sites representing the major climate types in Australia. On a typical soil with plant available water capacity (PAWC) of 147 mm, simulated yield increase with early vigour associated with larger seed size was on average 4% higher compared with normal vigour wheat. Early vigour through selection of doubled early leaf sizes could increase yield by 16%. Increase in yield was mainly from increase in biomass and grain number, and was reduced at sites with seasonal rainfall plus initial soil water <300 mm. Opportunities exists for development of early vigour wheat varieties for wetter sites. Soil PAWC could play a significant role in delivering the benefit of early vigour and would require particular attention.","authors":"Zhigan Zhao, Greg J Rebetzke, Bangyou Zheng, Scott C Chapman, Enli Wang","keywords":"APSIM next generation, environment, establishment, genotype, management, Triticum aestivum","pub_date":"27 March 2019","title":"Modelling impact of early vigour on wheat yield in dryland regions"},{"link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/9/2449/5348049?rss=1","origin":"","abstract":"Accurate predictions of the timing of physiological stages and the development rate are crucial for predicting crop performance under field conditions. Plant development is controlled by the leaf appearance rate (LAR) and our understanding of how LAR responds to environmental factors is still limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that carbon availability may account for the effects of irradiance, photoperiod, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and ontogeny on LAR. We conducted three experiments in growth chambers to quantify and disentangle these effects for both winter and spring wheat cultivars. Variations of LAR observed between environmental scenarios were well explained by the supply/demand ratio for carbon, quantified using the photothermal quotient. We therefore developed an ecophysiological model based on the photothermal quotient that accounts for the effects of temperature, irradiance, photoperiod, and ontogeny on LAR. Comparisons of observed leaf stages and LAR with simulations from our model, from a linear thermal-time model, and from a segmented linear thermal-time model corrected for sowing date showed that our model can simulate the observed changes in LAR in the field with the lowest error.

Radiation interception efficiency (RIE) and radiation use efficiency (RUE) have low heritabilities in such canopies. We propose a revised Monteith equation that identifies environmental and genetic components of RIE and RUE. An environmental term, a component of RIE, characterizes the effect of the presence or absence of neighbours on light interception. The ability of a given plant to compete with its neighbours is then identified, which accounts for the genetic variability of RIE of plants having similar leaf areas. This method was used in three experiments in a phenotyping platform with 765 plants of 255 maize hybrids. As expected, the heritability of the environmental term was near zero, whereas that of the competitiveness term increased with phenological stage, resulting in the identification of quantitative trait loci. In the same way, RUE was dissected as an effect of intercepted light and a genetic term. This approach was used for predicting the behaviour of individual genotypes in virtual multi-genotype canopies. A large effect of competitiveness was observed in multi-genotype but not in single-genotype canopies, resulting in a bias for genotype comparisons in breeding fields.","authors":"Tsu-Wei Chen, Llorenç Cabrera-Bosquet, Santiago Alvarez Prado, Raphaël Perez, Simon Artzet, Christophe Pradal, Aude Coupel-Ledru, Christian Fournier, François Tardieu","keywords":"canopy heterogeneity, GWAS, high-throughput phenotyping, inter-genotypic competition, light interception, light use efficiency, maize, plant architecture, varietal mixture","pub_date":"18 April 2019","title":"Genetic and environmental dissection of biomass accumulation in multi-genotype maize canopies"},{"link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/9/2479/5364280?rss=1","origin":"","abstract":"In current rice breeding programs, morphological parameters such as plant height, leaf length and width, leaf angle, panicle architecture, and tiller number during the grain filling stage are used as major selection targets. However, so far, there is no robust approach to quantitatively define the optimal combinations of parameters that can lead to increased canopy radiation use efficiency (RUE). Here we report the development of a three-dimensional canopy photosynthesis model (3dCAP), which effectively combines three-dimensional canopy architecture, canopy vertical nitrogen distribution, a ray-tracing algorithm, and a leaf photosynthesis model. Concurrently, we developed an efficient workflow for the parameterization of 3dCAP. 3dCAP predicted daily canopy RUE for different nitrogen treatments of a given rice cultivar under different weather conditions. Using 3dCAP, we explored the influence of three canopy architectural parameters—tiller number, tiller angle and leaf angle—on canopy RUE. Under different weather conditions and different nitrogen treatments, canopy architecture optimized by manipulating these parameters can increase daily net canopy photosynthetic CO2 uptake by 10–52%. Generally, a smaller tiller angle was predicted for most elite rice canopy architectures, especially under scattered light conditions. Results further show that similar canopy RUE can be obtained by multiple different parameter combinations; these combinations share two common features of high light absorption by leaves in the canopy and a high level of coordination between the nitrogen concentration and the light absorbed by each leaf within the canopy.

The method predicts a high investment of nitrogen in Rubisco under conditions leading to excessive energy supply relative to metabolic demand (e.g. low temperature, high light, low nitrogen, or low CO2). Conversely, more nitrogen is invested in chlorophyll when the energy supply is limiting. Overall, our optimization results are qualitatively consistent with literature reports. Commonly reported changes in photosynthetic parameters with growth temperature were emergent properties of the optimum nitrogen partitioning. The method was used to simulate dynamic acclimation under varying environmental conditions, using first-order kinetics. Simulated diurnal patterns of leaf photosynthetic rates as a result of acclimation differed greatly from those without acclimation (Awithout).

Integrating this dynamic model into a multi-layer canopy model provided accurate predictions of photosynthetic acclimation of greenhouse cucumber canopies grown under high and low nitrogen supply in combination with day-to-day fluctuations in light at two different levels. This allowed us to quantify the degree of optimality in canopy nitrogen use for maximizing canopy carbon assimilation, which was influenced by Nph distribution along canopy depth or Nph partitioning between functional pools. Our analyses suggest that Nph distribution is close to optimum and Nph reallocation is more important under low nitrogen. Nph partitioning is only optimal under a light level similar to the average light intensity during acclimation, meaning that day-to-day light fluctuations inevitably result in suboptimal Nph partitioning.

We used the Sirius wheat model to optimize drought-tolerant (DT) and drought-sensitive (DS) wheat ideotypes under a future 2050 climate scenario at 13 contrasting sites, representing major wheat growing regions in Europe. Averaged over the sites, DT ideotypes achieved 13.4% greater yield compared with DS, with higher yield stability. However, the performances of the ideotypes were site dependent. Mean yield of DT was 28–37% greater compared with DS in southern Europe. In contrast, no yield difference (≤1%) between ideotypes was found in north-western Europe. An intermediate yield benefit of 10–23% was found due to drought tolerance in central and eastern Europe.

For challenging production environments in Australia, we examine the potential opportunities to capture physiological traits, and to integrate genetic and molecular approaches for future model development and applications. Model improvement will require both reducing the uncertainty in simulating key physiological processes and enhancing the capture of key observable traits and underlying genetic control of key physiological responses to environment.
