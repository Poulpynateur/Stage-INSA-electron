One of the driving forces responsible for alterations in brain morphology is increasing environmental complexity that may demand for enhanced cognitive abilities (e.g. attention, memory and learning). However, studies looking at the relationship between brain morphology and learning are scarce. Here, we tested the effects of both learning and environmental enrichment on neural plasticity in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), by means of either a reversal-learning test or a spatial-learning test. Given considerable evidence supporting environmentally-induced plastic alterations, two separate control groups that were not subjected to any cognitive test were included to account for potential changes induced by the experimental setup alone. We did not find any effect of learning on any of our brain measurements. However, we found strong evidence for an environmental effect, where fish given access to the spatial-learning environment had larger relative brain size and optic tectum size in relation to those exposed to the reversal-learning environment. Our results demonstrate the plasticity of the adult brain to respond adaptively mainly to environmental conditions, providing support for the environmental enhancement theory.","keywords":"Brain plasticity, Cognition, Reversal learning, Spatial learning","title":"Plastic changes in brain morphology in relation to learning and environmental enrichment in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata)","authors":"Stephanie Fong, Séverine D.

The eversible vesicles are their unique paired transporting organs, which consist of an epithelium located inside a tube-like structure called the collophore on the first abdominal segment. The vesicles can be protruded out of the collophore and several lines of evidence indicate that they have a vital function in water uptake and ion balance. However, the amount of water absorbed by the vesicles and which other ions apart from sodium are transported remain unknown. Using Orchesella cincta as a model, we developed protocols for two assays that enabled us to study water and ion movement across the eversible vesicles in whole living springtails. Using an inverse Ramsay assay we demonstrate that the eversible vesicles absorb water from a droplet applied onto their surface. Using the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET) we show that the vesicles absorb Na+ and Cl− from the bathing medium, secrete NH4+, and both absorb and secrete K+. H+ is secreted at a low level in the anterior part and absorbed at the posterior part. We did not detect transport of Ca2+ at significant levels. The highest flux was the absorption of Cl−, and the magnitude of ion fluxes were significantly lower in fully hydrated springtails.

Consequently, mainly natural selection is considered to have shaped the attachment system in relation to weight load and substrate. However, sexual selection may also be important because many animals attach to the partner during mating. Both hypotheses generate opposing predictions in species where males are smaller than females. Natural selection predicts the attachment ability to scale positively with load, and hence body size, and so be larger in females than males. Sexual selection predicts attachment forces in males to be larger than females, despite the males’ smaller size because males benefit from uninterrupted copulation by stronger attachment to the female. We tested these predictions in the common bedbug Cimex lectularius, a species in which both sexes, as well as nymphs, regularly carry large loads, blood meals of up to three times the body weight. By measuring attachment forces to smooth surfaces and analysing in-situ fixed copulating pairs and the morphology of attachment devices, we show i) that males generate twice the attachment force of females, although weighing 15 % less, ii) that males adhere to females during copulation using hairy tibial adhesive pads, iii) more setae, and more setae per unit area, in the pads of males than females but no difference in shape of tarsal setae, and iv) the absence of hairy tibial attachment pads and low attachment force in nymphs. These results are consistent with a sexually selected function of attachment in bedbugs. Controlling sperm transfer and mate guarding by attaching to females during copulation may also shape the evolution of male attachment structures in other species. More generally, we hypothesise the existence of arms races of male attachment structures and female counterparts to impede attachment which may result in a similar evolutionary diversification as male genitalia.","keywords":"Adhesive setae, Centrifugal force test, Fossulae spongiosa, Resilin, Safety factor, Sexual conflict, Tibial setae","title":"Evidence for a sexually selected function of the attachment system in bedbugs Cimex lectularius (Heteroptera, Cimicidae)","authors":"Klaus Reinhardt, Dagmar Voigt, Stanislav N.

This could be an optimal strategy for scavenger/gatherer animals inhabiting landscapes with fewer features. However, animals inhabiting cluttered landscapes, especially predatory animals, may require substantial familiarity with foraging landscapes to forage efficiently. They may acquire such spatial familiarity with increasing age/experience, and eventually reduce their foraging effort without compromising on foraging success/efficiency. To check whether this holds for the individually foraging predatory tropical paper-wasp Ropalidia marginata, we recorded the number and duration of all foraging trips, the identity of foraged materials, and the directions of outbound and inbound flights (with respect to the nest) of known-age wasps for three consecutive days from three naturally occurring colonies; thus, we measured behavioural profiles of wasps of various ages, and not from the same wasp throughout its lifespan. Wasps increased their foraging duration rapidly until about 4 weeks of age, during which they rarely brought food, although some wasps brought building material and water. Thereafter, their foraging duration started decreasing. Nevertheless, their foraging success/efficiency in bringing food kept on increasing. With age, wasps developed individual directional preferences for outbound and inbound flights, indicating the development of spatial memory for rewarding sites. Also, the angular difference between their outbound and subsequent inbound flights gradually increased, indicating older wasps may have followed tortuous foraging routes. High investment in early life to acquire familiarity with foraging landscapes and using that later to perform efficient foraging could be an optimal strategy for individually foraging animals inhabiting feature-rich landscapes.","keywords":"Foraging strategy, Spatial learning and memory, Social hymenoptera, Evolution, Behavioural ecology","title":"Getting older, getting smarter: ontogeny of foraging behaviour in the tropical social wasp Ropalidia marginata","authors":"Souvik Mandal, Anindita Brahma","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"2 May 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/9/jeb195628","abstract":"Many parasitic wasps use slender and steerable ovipositors to lay eggs in hosts hidden in substrates, but it is currently unknown how steering is achieved. The ovipositors generally consist of three longitudinally connected elements, one dorsal and two ventral valves that can slide along each other. For the parasitic wasp Diachasmimorpha longicaudata, it has been shown that protraction of the ventral valves causes incurving of the ventral valves towards the dorsal one, which results in a change in probing direction. We hypothesize that this shape change is due to differences in bending stiffness along the ovipositor. Alignment of the stiff tip of the dorsal valve with a more flexible ventral S-shaped region situated just behind the tip straightens this S-bend and results in upwards rotation of the ventral tip. We show that the S-shaped region of the ventral valves has a low bending stiffness because it contains soft materials such as resilin. In contrast, the large cross-sectional area of the dorsal valve tip area probably results in a high bending stiffness. Elsewhere, the dorsal valve is less stiff than the ventral valves. Our results support the hypothesis that the interaction between the stiff dorsal valve portion and the more flexible S-shaped region co-determines the configurational tip changes required for steering the ovipositor in any desired direction along curved paths in the substrate. This provides novel insights in the understanding of steering mechanisms of the hymenopteran ovipositor, and for application in man-made probes.","keywords":"Hymenoptera, Material and structural properties, Ovipositor biomechanics, Steering mechanism","title":"Stiffness gradients facilitate ovipositor bending and spatial probing control in a parasitic wasp","authors":"Uroš Cerkvenik, Johan L. van Leeuwen, Alexander Kovalev, Stanislav N.

To test the hypothesis that autonomic cardiac regulation protects cardiac performance in rainbow trout during acute warming, we investigated adrenergic and cholinergic regulation during the onset and progression of cardiac limitations. We explored the direct effects of adrenergic stimulation by acutely warming an in situ working perfused heart until arrhythmia occurred, cooling the heart to restore rhythmicity and rewarming with increasing adrenergic stimulation. Adrenergic stimulation produced a clear, dose-dependent increase in the temperature and peak fH achieved prior to the onset of arrhythmia. To examine how this adrenergic protection functions in conjunction with cholinergic vagal inhibition in vivo, rainbow trout fitted with ECG electrodes were acutely warmed in a respirometer until they lost equilibrium (CTmax) with and without muscarinic (atropine) and β-adrenergic (sotalol) antagonists. Trout exhibited roughly equal and opposing cholinergic and adrenergic tone on fH that persisted up to critical temperatures. β-Adrenergic blockade significantly lowered peak fH by 14–17%, while muscarinic blockade significantly lowered the temperature for peak fH by 2.0°C. Moreover, muscarinic and β-adrenergic blockers injected individually or together significantly reduced CTmax by up to 3°C, indicating for the first time that cardiac adrenergic stimulation and cholinergic inhibition can enhance acute heat tolerance in rainbow trout at the level of the heart and the whole animal.","keywords":"Upper thermal tolerance, Autonomic regulation, Heart rate, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Cardiac arrhythmia","title":"Autonomic cardiac regulation facilitates acute heat tolerance in rainbow trout: in situ and in vivo support","authors":"Matthew J.

The corresponding increase in Vg protein expression was also confirmed by electrophoretic and immunoblotting analyses. Remarkably, in females, the tendency was opposite. Nematodal infection significantly reduced both Vg mRNA and Vg protein expression levels in fat body and hemolymph, respectively. We speculate that infection of reproductive females reduces Vg expression to the level, which is still sufficient for defense, but insufficient for reproduction. This circumstance reduces energy expenditure and helps the individual to cope with the infection. Importantly, purified Vg significantly inhibited growth of Xenorhabdus spp., an entomotoxic bacteria isolated from S. carpocapsae. However, the effect of Vg against I. fumosorosea was not so obvious. The fungus significantly stimulated Vg gene expression in males, however, a similar increase was not recapitulated on the protein level. Nevertheless, in females, both mRNA and protein Vg levels were significantly reduced after the fungal infection. The obtained data demonstrate that Vg is likely an important defense protein, possibly with a specific activity.

We evaluated bone mechanical properties in the Longshanks mouse, which was selectively bred for increased tibia length relative to body mass. We combined analyses of 3D shape and cross-sectional geometry of the tibia, with mechanical testing, and bone composition assays, to compare bone strength, elastic properties, and mineral composition in Longshanks and in random-bred controls. Our data show that, despite being more slender, cortical geometry and predicted bending strength of the Longshanks tibia were similar to controls. In whole bone bending tests, measures of bone bending strength were similar across groups, however, Longshanks tibiae were significantly more rigid, more brittle, and required less than half the energy to fracture. Tissue-level elastic properties were altered in the same way in Longshanks, but the bones did not differ in water content, ash content, or density. These results indicate that while Longshanks bones are as strong as random-bred control tibiae, selection for increased tibia length has altered its elastic properties, possibly through changes in organic bony matrix composition. We conclude that selection for certain limb morphologies, and/or selection for rapid skeletal growth, can lead to tissue-level changes that can increase the risk of skeletal fracture, which in turn may favor the correlated evolution of compensatory mechanisms to mitigate increased fracture risk, such as delayed skeletal maturity.","keywords":"Artificial selection, Bone cross-sectional geometry, Bone stiffness, Bone strength, Longshanks mouse","title":"Selection for longer limbs in mice increases bone stiffness and brittleness, but does not alter bending strength","authors":"Miranda N.

In this study, we compare average joint angular excursions during cyclic behaviors – chewing, walking and running – in a phylogenetic context to explore differences in the optimality criteria of these two systems. Across 111 tetrapod species, average limb-joint angular excursions during cyclic locomotion are greater and more evolutionarily labile than those of the jaw joint during cyclic chewing. We argue that these findings reflect fundamental functional dichotomies between tetrapod locomotor and feeding systems. Tetrapod chewing systems are optimized for precise application of force over a narrower, more controlled and predictable range of displacements, the principal aim being to fracture the substrate, the size and mechanical properties of which are controlled at ingestion and further reduced and homogenized, respectively, by the chewing process. In contrast, tetrapod limbed locomotor systems are optimized for fast and energetically efficient application of force over a wider and less predictable range of displacements, the principal aim being to move the organism at varying speeds relative to a substrate whose geometry and mechanical properties need not become more homogeneous as locomotion proceeds. Hence, the evolution of tetrapod locomotor systems has been accompanied by an increasing diversity of limb-joint excursions, as tetrapods have expanded across a range of locomotor substrates and environments.","keywords":"Joint-angle excursion, Locomotion, Chewing, Cyclic behavior, Phylogenetics","title":"Joint angular excursions during cyclical behaviors differ between tetrapod feeding and locomotor systems","authors":"Michael C.

We manipulated the yolk concentrations of vitamin E and corticosterone, which are the main antioxidants and, respectively, the main glucocorticoid hormone in bird eggs, both independently and simultaneously and we tested their separate and combined effects on growth and oxidative status in the liver and in the brain of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) embryos. Egg supplementation of relatively large, yet physiological doses of corticosterone depressed embryo growth (total body mass, tarsus length and liver mass) while administration of vitamin E in association with corticosterone restored normal growth. Vitamin E did not affect embryo growth when administered alone. We further analyzed independent and combined effects of vitamin E and corticosterone on liver and brain total antioxidant capacity, concentration of reactive oxygen molecules and lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E significantly reduced liver total antioxidant capacity, while corticosterone depressed brain lipid peroxidation. Prenatal exposure to vitamin E and corticosterone appears to have antagonistic effects on body growth, although vitamin E is not limiting in yellow-legged gull eggs. In combination with the results of previous experiments on the same species applying smaller experimental doses or focusing on the post-natal rather than pre-natal life stages, our findings indicate that the effects of a physiological increase in the egg concentrations of these substances can be life stage- and dose-specific, implying that generalizing prenatal effects of egg compounds may not be feasible.","keywords":"Corticosterone, Embryo growth, Yellow-legged gull, Oxidative status, Vitamin E","title":"Prenatal independent and combined effects of yolk vitamin E and corticosterone on embryo growth and oxidative status in the yellow-legged gull","authors":"Marco Parolini, Cristina Daniela Possenti, Simona Secomandi, Silvia Carboni, Manuela Caprioli, Diego Rubolini, Andrea Romano, Nicola Saino","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"1 May 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/9/jeb198564","abstract":"Muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) mice carry a deletion in the N2A region of the gene for the muscle protein titin (TTN), shiver at low frequency, fail to maintain body temperatures (Tb) at ambient temperatures (Ta) <34°C, and have reduced body mass and active muscle stiffness in vivo compared with wild-type (WT) siblings.

This has been found in a variety of population groups and other species. However, these studies were mostly performed on smooth, level ground or on treadmills. We hypothesized that the objective function for walking is more complex than only minimizing the COT. To test this idea, we compared the preferred speeds and the relationships between COT and speed for people walking on both a smooth, level floor and a rough, natural terrain trail. Rough terrain presumably introduces other factors, such as stability, to the objective function. Ten healthy men walked on both a straight, flat, smooth floor and an outdoor trail strewn with rocks and boulders. In both locations, subjects performed five to seven trials at different speeds relative to their preferred speed. The COT–speed relationships were similarly U-shaped for both surfaces, but the COT values on rough terrain were approximately 115% greater. On the smooth surface, the preferred speed (1.24±0.17 m s−1) was not found to be statistically different (P=0.09) than the speed that minimized COT (1.34±0.03 m s−1). On rough terrain, the preferred speed (1.07±0.05 m s−1) was significantly slower than the COT minimum speed (1.13±0.07 m s−1; P=0.02). Because near the optimum speed the COT function is very shallow, these changes in speed result in a small change in COT (0.5%).

We posit that peripheral musculoskeletal structures, e.g. muscle, are more realistic control targets than the COM, given their abundance of sensorimotor receptors and ability to influence whole-body energetics. As a first test of this hypothesis, we examined whether conservation of stance-phase joint mechanics is prioritized over COM mechanics in a locomotor task where simultaneous conservation of COM and joint mechanics is not feasible: imposed leg-length asymmetry. Positive joint mechanical cost of transport (work per distance traveled; COTJNT) was maintained at values closer to normal walking than COM mechanical cost of transport (COTCOM; P<0.05, N=15). Furthermore, compared with our measures of COM mechanics (COTCOM, COM displacement), joint-level variables (COTJNT, integrated total support moment) also displayed stronger conservation (less change from normal walking) when the participants' self-selected gait was assessed against other possible gait solutions. We conclude that when walking humans are exposed to an asymmetric leg-length perturbation, control of joint mechanics is prioritized over COM mechanics. Our results suggest that mechanical and metabolic effort is likely regulated via control of peripheral structures and not directly at the level of the COM. Joint mechanics may provide a more accurate representation of the underlying locomotor control targets and may prove advantageous in informing predictive models of human walking.","keywords":"Cost of transport, Locomotion, Inverted pendulum, Joint, Control, Prioritization","title":"Is conservation of center of mass mechanics a priority in human walking?

A lower CoT allows animals to allocate more of their energy budget to growth and reproduction. A higher CoT may cause animals to adjust their movement across different environmental gradients to reduce energy allocated to movement. The aim of this project was to determine whether CoT is a repeatable trait within individuals, and to determine its physiological causes and ecological consequences. We found that CoT is a repeatable trait in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We rejected the hypothesis that mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratios) predicted CoT. We also rejected the hypothesis that CoT is modulated by temperature acclimation, exercise training or their interaction, although CoT increased with increasing acute test temperature. There was a weak but significant negative correlation between CoT and dispersal, measured as the number of exploration decisions made by fish, and the distance travelled against the current in an artificial stream. However, CoT was not correlated with the voluntary speed of fish moving against the current. The implication of these results is that CoT reflects a fixed physiological phenotype of an individual, which is not plastic in response to persistent environmental changes. Consequently, individuals may have fundamentally different energy budgets as they move across environments, and may adjust movement patterns as a result of allocation trade-offs. It was surprising that mitochondrial efficiency did not explain differences in CoT, and our working hypothesis is that the energetics of muscle contraction and relaxation may determine CoT. The increase in CoT with increasing acute environmental temperature means that warming environments will increase the proportion of the energy budget allocated to locomotion unless individuals adjust their movement patterns.","keywords":"Oxygen consumption, Temperature, Exercise, Locomotion, Acclimation, Allocation trade-off","title":"Cost of transport is a repeatable trait but is not determined by mitochondrial efficiency in zebrafish (Danio rerio)","authors":"Miki Jahn, Frank Seebacher","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"30 April 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/early/2019/04/25/jeb.199638","abstract":"Unlike vertebrates, the penaeid shrimp stomach is of ectodermic origin and is thus covered by a cuticle that is sloughed upon molting.

This carpet serves as a selective filter that excludes large partially-digested food particles but allows smaller particles and soluble materials to enter hepatopancreatic ducts that conduct them into the shrimp hepatopancreas (HP) where further digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place. Although the GS function is well known, its exclusion limit for particulate material has not been clearly defined. Using histological and ultra-structure analysis, we show that the GS sieve pore diameter is approximately 0.2-0.7 μm in size, indicating a size exclusion limit (SEL) of substantially less than 1 μm. Using fluorescent microbeads we show that particles of 1 μm diameter could not pass the GS but that those 0.1 μm diameter did pass through to accumulate in longitudinal grooves and move onto the HP where some were internalized by tubule epithelial cells. We found no significant differences in these sizes between the species Penaeus monodon and Penaeus vannamei or between juveniles and adults in P. vannamei. This information will be of value for design of particulate feed ingredients such as nutrients, therapeutic drugs and toxin-absorbing materials that may selectively target the stomach, intestine or HP of cultivated shrimp.","keywords":"Gastric sieve, Penaeus monodon, Penaeus monodon, Penaeus vannamei, Penaeus vannamei, Micro-fluorescence bead, Sieve exclusion","title":"The gastric sieve of penaeid shrimp species is a sub-micron nutrient filter","authors":"Werawich Pattarayingsakul, Arnon Pudgerd, Natthinee Munkongwongsiri, Rapeepun Vanichviriyakit, Thawatchai Chaijarasphong, Siripong Thitamadee, Thanapong Kruangkum","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"26 April 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/early/2019/04/25/jeb.197970","abstract":"The embryonic development of parabronchi occurs mainly during the second half of incubation in precocious birds, which makes this phase sensitive to possible morphological modifications induced by O2 supply limitation. Thus, we hypothesized that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development induces morphological changes that remain after hatching. To test this hypothesis, chicken embryos were incubated entirely (21 days) under normoxia or partially under hypoxia (15% O2 during days 12 to 18). Lung structures, including air capillaries, blood capillaries, infundibula, atria, parabronchial lumen, bronchi, blood vessels larger than capillaries (Bv) and interparabronchial tissue (It), in 1- and 10-day-old chicks were analyzed using light microscopy-assisted stereology. Tissue barrier and surface area of air capillaries were measured using electron microscopy-assisted stereology, allowing for calculation of the anatomical diffusion factor. Hypoxia increased the relative volumes of air and blood capillaries, structures directly involved in gas exchange, while decreased the relative volumes of atria in both groups of chicks, and the parabronchial lumen in older chicks. Accordingly, the surface area of the air capillaries and the anatomical diffusion factor were increased under hypoxic incubation. Treatment did not alter total lung volume, relative volumes of infundibula, bronchi, Bv, It, or the tissue barrier of any group. We conclude that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development lead to a morphological remodeling, characterized by increased volume density and respiratory surface area of structures involved in gas exchange at the expense of structures responsible for air conduction in chicks up to 10 days old.","keywords":"Incubation, Blood capillary, Air capillary, Lung, Blood-gas tissue barrier, Chicken","title":"Parabronchial remodeling in chicks in response to embryonic hypoxia","authors":"Lara do Amaral-Silva, Markus Lambertz, Fernando José Zara, Wilfried Klein, Luciane Helena Gargaglioni, Kênia Cardoso Bícego","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"26 April 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/9/jeb197954","abstract":"ECG recordings were obtained using an implanted telemetry device from the South American rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus, held under stable conditions without restraining cables or interaction with researchers. Mean heart rate (fH) recovered rapidly (<24 h) from anaesthesia and operative procedures. This preceded a more gradual development of heart rate variability (HRV), with instantaneous fH increasing during each lung ventilation cycle. Atropine injection increased mean fH and abolished HRV. Complete autonomic blockade revealed a cholinergic tonus on the heart of 55% and an adrenergic tonus of 37%. Power spectral analysis of HRV identified a peak at the same frequency as ventilation. This correlation was sustained after temperature changes and it was more evident, marked by a more prominent power spectrum peak, when ventilation is less episodic. This HRV component is homologous to that observed in mammals, termed respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Evidence for instantaneous control of fH indicated rapid conduction of activity in the cardiac efferent nervous supply, as supported by the description of myelinated fibres in the cardiac vagus. Establishment of HRV 10 days after surgical intervention seems a reliable indicator of the re-establishment of control of integrative functions by the autonomic nervous system.

The metabolic demands of visual systems therefore make them highly sensitive to fluctuations in available oxygen. In the marine environment, oxygen changes over daily, seasonal, and inter-annual time scales and there are large gradients of oxygen with depth. Vision is linked to survival in many marine animals, particularly among the crustaceans, cephalopods, and fish, and early life stages of these groups rely on vision for prey capture, predator detection, and their distribution in the water column. Using in vivo electroretinogram recordings, we show that there is a decrease in retinal sensitivity to light in marine invertebrates when exposed to reduced oxygen availability. We found a 60-100% reduction in retinal responses in the larvae of cephalopods and crustaceans: the market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculatus), tuna crab (Pleuroncodes planipes), and brachyuran crab (Metacarcinus gracilis). A decline in oxygen also decreases the temporal resolution of vision in D. opalescens. These results are the first demonstration that vision in marine invertebrates is highly sensitive to oxygen availability and that the thresholds for visual impairment from reduced oxygen are species-specific. Oxygen-impaired retinal function may change the visual behaviors crucial to survival in these marine larvae. These findings may impact our understanding of species’ vulnerability to ocean oxygen loss and suggest that researchers conducting electrophysiology experiments should monitor oxygen levels, as even small changes in oxygen may affect the results.","keywords":"Vision, Phototransduction, Physiology, Electroretinogram, Hypoxia","title":"Vision is highly sensitive to oxygen availability in marine invertebrate larvae","authors":"Lillian R.

Fatty acid desaturases, enzymes introducing double bonds into fatty acids, are crucial for the biosynthesis of these chemical signals. Δ12-desaturases catalyse the biosynthesis of linoleic acid by introducing a second double bond into oleic acid, but have been identified in only few animal species. Here we report the functional characterisation of two Δ12- desaturases, Nvit_D12a and Nvit_D12b, from the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis (Walker). We demonstrate that Nvit_D12a is expressed in the rectal vesicle of males where they produce a linoleic acid-derived sex pheromone to attract virgin females. 13C-labelling experiments with Urolepis rufipes (Ashmead), a closely related species belonging to the so-called “Nasonia-group”, revealed that females but not males are able to synthesise linoleic acid. U. rufipes males produce an isoprenoid sex pheromone in the same gland and do not depend on linoleic acid for pheromone production. This suggests that Δ12-desaturases, while common in the “Nasonia group”, acquired a specialised function in chemical communication of those species that use linoleic acid as a pheromone precursor. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that insect Δ12-desaturases have evolved repeatedly from Δ9-desaturases in different insect taxa. Hence, insects have developed a way to produce linoleic acid independent of the “Omega”-desaturase subfamily which harbours the eukaryotic Δ12-desaturases known so far.","keywords":"Parasitic wasp, Δ12-desaturase, Sex pheromone, Biosynthesis, Nasonia vitripennis, Nasonia vitripennis, Urolepis rufipes, Urolepis rufipes","title":"Functional characterisation of two Δ12-desaturases demonstrates targeted production of linoleic acid as pheromone precursor in Nasonia","authors":"Florian Semmelmann, Naoki Kabeya, Miriama Malcicka, Astrid Bruckmann, Bastian Broschwitz, Kristina Straub, Rainer Merkl, Oscar Monroig, Reinhard Sterner, Joachim Ruther, Jacintha Ellers","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"24 April 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/early/2019/04/24/jeb.194969","abstract":"It is now well established that the intrauterine life environment is of major importance for health during later life.

We found that the tracer ensemble probability density function for displacement is time-dependent, but consists of a Gaussian core and robust exponential tails (so-called non-Gaussian diffusion). This can be explained by interactions of far-field Brownian motions and a near-field entrainment effect along with microscale flows. The contribution of exponential tails sharply increases with algal density, and saturates at a critical density, implying a trade-off between aggregated benefit and negative competition for the spatially self-organized cells.

In both tasks, participants performed periodic movement about the knee joint in the gravitational field. Therefore, net external mechanical work was constrained to be zero.

Here, to begin to understand snake locomotion in complex 3-D terrain, we studied how the variable kingsnake, a terrestrial generalist, traversed a large step of variable surface friction and step height (up to 30% snout–vent length). The snake traversed by partitioning its body into three sections with distinct functions. Body sections below and above the step oscillated laterally on horizontal surfaces for propulsion, whereas the body section in between cantilevered in a vertical plane to bridge the large height increase. As the animal progressed, these three sections traveled down its body, conforming overall body shape to the step. In addition, the snake adjusted the partitioned gait in response to increase in step height and decrease in surface friction, at the cost of reduced speed. As surface friction decreased, body movement below and above the step changed from a continuous lateral undulation with little slip to an intermittent oscillatory movement with much slip, and initial head lift-off became closer to the step. Given these adjustments, body partitioning allowed the snake to be always stable, even when initially cantilevering but before reaching the surface above.

All bats successfully learned to use the landmark to guide navigation through the net opening. Probe trials yielded an increase in both the time to complete the task and the number of net crashes, confirming that the bats relied largely on the landmark to find the net opening. Further, landmark acoustic distinctiveness influenced performance in probe trials and sonar inspection behaviors. Analyses of the animals' vocal behaviors also revealed differences between call features of bats inspecting landmarks compared with distractors, suggesting increased sonar attention to objects used to guide navigation.","keywords":"Acoustic orientation, Active sensing, Way-finding, Biosonar, Spatial perception","title":"Echolocating bats inspect and discriminate landmark features to guide navigation","authors":"Chao Yu, Jinhong Luo, Melville Wohlgemuth, Cynthia F.

We show that the olfactory system on each side of the bee can learn and retrieve information independently and the retrieval using the antenna on the side contralateral to the trained one is not affected by the training. Using the setup in which the memory on the contralateral side has been reported at 3 h after training, we see that the memory is available on the contralateral side immediately after training. In the same setup, coating the antenna with an insulator on the training side does not prevent learning, pointing to a possible insufficiency of the block of odor stimuli in this setup. Moreover, the behavior of the bee as a whole can be predicted if the sides are assumed to learn and store independently, and the organism as a whole is able to retrieve the memory if either of the sides have the memory.","keywords":"PER conditioning, Mushroom body, Olfactory coding, Insect olfaction, Learning and memory","title":"Evidence for absence of bilateral transfer of olfactory learned information in Apis dorsata and Apis mellifera","authors":"Meenakshi Vijaykumar, Sandhya Mogily, Aparna Dutta-Gupta, Joby Joseph","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"18 April 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/8/jeb195982","abstract":"Corals continuously adjust to short-term variation in light availability on shallow reefs. Long-term light alterations can also occur as a result of natural and anthropogenic stressors, as well as management interventions such as coral transplantation. Although short-term photophysiological responses are relatively well understood in corals, little information is available regarding photoacclimation dynamics over weeks of altered light availability. We coupled photophysiology and metabolomic profiling to explore changes that accompany longer-term photoacclimation in a key Great Barrier Reef coral species, Acropora muricata. High light (HL)- and low light (LL)-acclimated corals were collected from the reef and reciprocally exposed to high and low light ex situ. Rapid light curves using pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry revealed photophysiological acclimation of LL corals to HL and HL corals to LL within 21 days. A subset of colonies sampled at 7 and 21 days for untargeted LC-MS and GC-MS metabolomic profiling revealed metabolic reorganization before acclimation was detected using PAM fluorometry. Metabolomic shifts were more pronounced for LL to HL corals than for their HL to LL counterparts. Compounds driving metabolomic separation between HL-exposed and LL control colonies included amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids and sterols. Reduced glycerol and campesterol suggest decreased translocation of photosynthetic products from symbiont to host in LL to HL corals, with concurrent increases in fatty acid abundance indicating reliance on stored lipids for energy. We discuss how these data provide novel insight into environmental regulation of metabolism and implications for management strategies that drive rapid changes in light availability.","keywords":"Coral reef, Light acclimation, Great Barrier Reef, Metabolite, Photosynthesis","title":"Resolving coral photoacclimation dynamics through coupled photophysiological and metabolomic profiling","authors":"Kathryn E.

Their production, mainly supported by aquatic microalgae, has been decreasing with global change. The consequences of such reductions may be profound for ectotherm consumers, as temperature tightly regulates the HUFA content in cell membranes, maintaining their functionality. Integrating individual, tissue and molecular approaches, we examined the consequences of the combined effects of temperature and HUFA depletion on the key cardio-respiratory functions of the golden grey mullet, an ectotherm grazer of high ecological importance. For 4 months, fish were exposed to two contrasting HUFA diets [4.8% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on dry matter (DM) versus 0.2% EPA+DHA on DM] at 12 and 20°C. Ventricular force development coupled with gene expression profiles measured on cardiac muscle suggest that combining HUFA depletion with warmer temperatures leads to: (1) a proliferation of sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ channels and (2) a higher force-generating ability by increasing extracellular Ca2+ influx via sarcolemmal channels when the heart has to sustain excessive effort due to stress and/or exercise. At the individual scale, these responses were associated with a greater aerobic scope, maximum metabolic rate and net cost of locomotion, suggesting the higher energy cost of this strategy. This impaired cardiac performance could have wider consequences for other physiological performance such as growth, reproduction or migration, all of which greatly depend on heart function.","keywords":"Omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids, Temperature, Cardiac performance, Swimming performance, Chelon auratus, Chelon auratus, RNAseq","title":"Ocean warming combined with lower omega-3 nutritional availability impairs the cardio-respiratory function of a marine fish","authors":"Marie Vagner, Eric Pante, Amelia Viricel, Thomas Lacoue-Labarthe, Jose-Luis Zambonino-Infante, Patrick Quazuguel, Emmanuel Dubillot, Valerie Huet, Herve Le Delliou, Christel Lefrançois, Nathalie Imbert-Auvray","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"15 April 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/8/jeb195446","abstract":"In complex biosonar scenes, the delay of echoes represents the spatial distribution of objects in depth.

However, close proximity of obstacles demands rapid pulse updates for steering to avoid collisions, which often means emitting a new sound before all of the previous echoes have returned. When two echo streams overlap, there is ambiguity about assigning echoes to the corresponding broadcasts. In laboratory tests of flight in dense, cluttered scenes, four species of echolocating bats exhibited different patterns of pulse emissions to accommodate potential pulse-echo ambiguity. Miniopterus fuliginosus emitted individual FM pulses only after all echoes of previous pulses had returned, with no alternating between long and short intervals. Pipistrellus abramus and Eptesicus fuscus alternated between emitting long FM pulse intervals to receive all echoes before the next pulse, and short intervals to update the rapidly changing scene while accepting partial overlap of successive echo streams. Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon transmitted CF/FM pulses in alternating short and long intervals, usually two to four closely spaced sounds that produced overlapping echo streams, followed by a longer interval that separated echo streams. Rhinolophus f. nippon is a statistical outlier from the three FM species, which are more similar to each other. The repeated overlap of CF/FM echo streams suggests that CF components have a distinct role in rejection of clutter and mitigation of ambiguity.","keywords":"Biosonar, Guiding flight, Echo delay, Interpulse intervals, Pulse-echo ambiguity, Phantom images","title":"Biosonar interpulse intervals and pulse-echo ambiguity in four species of echolocating bats","authors":"James A.

For California market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), maintaining essential behaviors like the escape response during environmental variations poses a major challenge as this species often encounters intrusions of cold, hypoxic offshore waters in its coastal spawning habitats. To explore the effects of hypoxia on locomotion and the underlying neural mechanisms, we made in vivo recordings of giant axon activity and simultaneous pressure inside the mantle cavity during escape jets in squid exposed to acute progressive hypoxia followed by return to normal dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (normoxia). Compared with those in normoxia (>8 mg l−1 DO), escape jets were unchanged in moderate hypoxia (4 and 2 mg l−1 DO), but giant axon activity and associated mantle contractions significantly decreased while neuromuscular latency increased under severe hypoxia (0.5 mg l−1 DO). Animals that survived exposure to severe hypoxia reliably produced escape jets under such conditions and fully recovered as more oxygen became available. The reduction in neuromuscular output under hypoxia suggests that market squid may suppress metabolic activity to maintain sufficient behavioral output, a common strategy in many hypoxia-tolerant species. The ability to recover from the deleterious effects of hypoxia suggests that this species is well adapted to cope with coastal hypoxic events that commonly occur in Monterey Bay, unless these events become more severe in the future as climate change progresses.","keywords":"Hypoxia, Squid, Escape response, Giant axon, Recovery","title":"Hypoxia tolerance of giant axon-mediated escape jetting in California market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens)","authors":"Diana H.

There is a critical need to maintain hydration in terrestrial environments having limited water. Atypical populations of Florida cottonmouth snakes, Agkistrodon conanti, inhabit continental islands with no permanent sources of fresh water. Here we report investigations related to how these insular snakes maintain water balance considering the mainland conspecifics are semi-aquatic and typically associate with freshwater mesic habitats. We tested three hypotheses related to water relations of insular populations of cottonmouths compared to those on the mainland. (1) Voluntary drinking of fresh water in free-ranging insular snakes should reflect a relationship to recency of rainfall more strongly than in mainland snakes. (2) Insular snakes will tolerate greater dehydration before drinking than will mainland snakes. (3) Insular snakes will avoid drinking seawater more strongly than will those from the mainland. Between 2001 and 2018, we quantitatively estimated the hydration status of 337 individual cottonmouths from insular populations and 30 cottonmouths from mainland Florida, as judged by the tendency of wild-caught snakes to drink fresh water immediately following capture. We found that insular cottonmouths had a higher incidence of dehydration than did mainland cottonmouths (64% vs. 23%), and the hydration status of the insular snakes correlated with patterns of precipitation. We also determined experimentally the dehydration threshold for drinking fresh water in insular (mean=−5.64±4.3%, n=34) and mainland cottonmouths (mean=−5.74±4.5%, n=21), and these were not significantly different. Discrimination tests for drinking serially from a graded series of brackish water showed that mainland snakes did not discriminate against the highest brackish value (10.5 ppt or 30% seawater), whereas insular snakes showed a preference for <15% seawater. Naïve neonates from insular and mainland cohorts behaved similarly. The preference of insular snakes for fresh water represents an important aspect of the maintenance of water balance that differs from the mainland conspecifics and is likely a habituated or adaptive response to dependence on rainfall.","keywords":"Water relations, Florida cottonmouth, Island, Drinking, Dehydration, Brackish water","title":"Water relations of an insular pit viper","authors":"Mark R.

This progression is thought to represent motor preparation, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we assessed the role of sensory feedback in the progression of INs to song. We found that the mean number of INs before song and the progression of INs to song were not affected by removal of two sensory feedback pathways (auditory or proprioceptive). In both feedback-intact and feedback-deprived birds, the presence of calls (other non-song vocalizations), just before the first IN, was correlated with fewer INs before song and an initial state closer to song. Finally, the initial IN state correlated with the time to song initiation. Overall, these results show that INs do not require real-time sensory feedback for progression to song. Rather, our results suggest that changes in IN features and their transition to song are controlled by internal neural processes, possibly involved in getting the brain ready to initiate a learned movement sequence.","keywords":"Bird song, Preparatory vocalizations, Zebra finch, Motor preparation, Sequence initiation","title":"Sensory feedback independent pre-song vocalizations correlate with time to song initiation","authors":"Divya Rao, Satoshi Kojima, Raghav Rajan","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"9 April 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/7/jeb195644","abstract":"Giant clams contain phototrophic zooxanthellae, and live in nutrient-deficient tropical waters where light is available.

SGLT1-like had a host origin and was expressed predominantly in the ctenidium. Molecular characterizations reveal that SGLT1-like of T. squamosa could transport urea, in addition to glucose, as other SGLT1s do. It has an apical localization in the epithelium of ctenidial filaments and water channels, and the apical anti-SGLT1-like immunofluorescence was stronger in individuals exposed to light than to darkness. Furthermore, the protein abundance of SGLT1-like increased significantly in the ctenidium of individuals exposed to light for 12 h, although the SGLT1-like transcript level remained unchanged. As expected, T. squamosa could perform light-enhanced glucose absorption, which was impeded by exogenous urea. These results denote the close relationships between light-enhanced glucose absorption and light-enhanced SGLT1-like expression in the ctenidium of T. squamosa. Although glucose absorption could be trivial compared with the donation of photosynthates from zooxanthellae in symbiotic adults, SGLT1-like might be essential for the survival of aposymbiotic larvae, leading to its retention in the symbiotic stage. A priori, glucose uptake through SGLT1-like might be augmented by the surface microbiome through nutrient cycling, and the absorbed glucose could partially fulfill the metabolic needs of the ctenidial cells.

High-speed cinematography demonstrated that mesokinesis occurs during food uptake, processing, and intraoral transport cycles. Bite force measurements showed prolonged and reasonably hard biting even at large gape. Based on this data we formulate a model of the amphikinetic Ablepharus skull mechanism, which provides an extension of Frazzetta's quadric-crank model by placing a special emphasis on metakinesis. According to this model, we hypothesize that metakinetic intracranial movements may provide a means for reducing strain in jaw adductor muscles.

In vivo studies during different flight modes revealed variation in strain profile, activation timing and duration, and contractile cycle frequency of the humerotriceps, suggesting that this muscle may alter wing shape in diverse ways. To examine the multifunction potential of the humerotriceps, we developed an in situ work loop approach to measure how activation duration and contractile cycle frequency affected muscle work and power across the full range of activation onset times. The humerotriceps produced predominantly net negative power, likely due to relatively long stimulus durations, indicating that it absorbs work, but the work loop shapes also suggest varying degrees of elastic energy storage and release. The humerotriceps consistently exhibited positive and negative instantaneous power within a single contractile cycle, across all treatments. When combined with previous in vivo studies, our results indicate that both within and across contractile cycles, the humerotriceps can dynamically shift among roles of actuator, brake, and stiff or compliant spring, based on activation properties that vary with flight mode.","keywords":"Flight, Active wing morphing, Wing muscle, Muscle function, Work loop, Pigeon","title":"Work loop dynamics of the pigeon (Columba livia) humerotriceps demonstrate potentially diverse roles for active wing morphing","authors":"Jolan S.

A highly diverse assemblage of subterranean dytiscids has evolved in isolated calcrete aquifers of Western Australia with limited/no access to an air–water interface, raising the question of how they are able to respire. We explored the hypothesis that they use cutaneous respiration by studying the mode of respiration in three subterranean dytiscid species from two isolated aquifers. The three beetle species consume O2 directly from the water, but they lack structures on their bodies that could have respiratory function. They also have a lower metabolic rate than other insects. O2 boundary layers surrounding the beetles are present, indicating that O2 diffuses into the surface of their bodies via cutaneous respiration. Cuticle thickness measurements and other experimental results were incorporated into a mathematical model to understand whether cutaneous respiration limits beetle size. The model indicates that the cuticle contributes considerably to resistance in the O2 cascade. As the beetles become larger, their metabolic scope narrows, potentially limiting their ability to allocate energy to mating, foraging and development at sizes above approximately 5 mg. However, the ability of these beetles to utilise cutaneous respiration has enabled the evolution of the largest assemblage of subterranean dytiscids in the world.","keywords":"Allometry, Aquatic insect, Body mass, Boundary layer, Cuticle, Metabolic rate, Oxygen consumption","title":"Cutaneous respiration by diving beetles from underground aquifers of Western Australia (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae)","authors":"Karl K.

Many species of mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda: Crustacea) use elastic energy storage to power high-speed strikes that they deliver to opponents during territorial contests and to hard–shelled prey while feeding. We compared the scaling of strike kinematics and energetics between feeding and contests in the mantis shrimp Neogonodactylus bredini. We filmed strikes with high-speed video, measured strike velocity and used a mathematical model to calculate strike energy. During contests, strike velocity did not scale with body size but strike energy scaled positively with size. Conversely, while feeding, strike velocity decreased with increasing size and strike energy did not vary according to body size. Individuals most likely achieved this strike variation through differential compression of their exoskeletal spring prior to the strike. Post hoc analyses found that N. bredini used greater velocity and energy when striking larger opponents, yet variation in prey size was not accompanied by varying strike velocity or energetics.

In randomly paired birds kept under a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle for about 52 weeks, food availability period was restricted to 4 h in the morning [morning food availability (FA) group] or evening (evening FA group), with controls provided with food ad libitum; thus, the daily food deprivation period began after 4 h of food availability in the morning food access group and was continuous with night-time starvation in the evening food access group. Both food restrictions adversely affected reproductive health, as shown by reduced sex steroid and mesotocin levels, but not general metabolism, as indicated by the absence of a difference in thyroxin and triiodothyronine levels. Restricting food access to a 4 h period negatively affected reproductive performance, although there were differences between pairs in the morning and evening FA groups.

To understand the underlying control, it is important to know how changes in leg muscle activity relate to leg kinematics (movements) and leg dynamics (forces, torques). Here, we studied these parameters in hindlegs of stick insects (Carausius morosus) during level and uphill/downhill (±45 deg) walking, using a combination of electromyography, 3D motion capture and ground reaction force measurements. We find that some kinematic parameters including leg joint angles and body height vary across walking conditions. However, kinematics vary little compared with dynamics: horizontal leg forces and torques at the thorax–coxa joint (leg protraction/retraction) and femur–tibia joint (leg flexion/extension) tend to be stronger during uphill walking and are reversed in sign during downhill walking. At the thorax–coxa joint, the different mechanical demands are met by adjustments in the timing and magnitude of antagonistic muscle activity. Adjustments occur primarily in the first half of stance after the touch-down of the leg. When insects transition from level to incline walking, the characteristic adjustments in muscle activity occur with the first step of the leg on the incline, but not in anticipation. Together, these findings indicate that stick insects adjust leg muscle activity on a step-by-step basis so as to maintain a similar kinematic pattern under different mechanical demands. The underlying control might rely primarily on feedback from leg proprioceptors signaling leg position and movement.","keywords":"Insect walking, Slope, Electromyography, Kinematics, Ground reaction force, Joint torque","title":"Motor control of an insect leg during level and incline walking","authors":"Chris J.

There are two types of melanin: eumelanins yield blackish hues, whereas pheomelanins yield reddish hues. The production of eumelanins requires low levels of glutathione (GSH), which is the most important intracellular antioxidant, whereas the production of pheomelanins requires high levels of GSH. We investigated the oxidative status of male pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) with different degrees of melanin coloration under different temperatures during the nestling period. Moreover, we assessed the oxidative status of offspring in relation to their biological or foster father's melanin coloration and ambient temperature. To separate offspring genotype effects and paternal effects in different temperatures, we used a partial cross-foster design. The temperature differently affected the oxidative status of differently colored male pied flycatchers and their foster offspring. When the weather was relatively cold, black males had higher glutathione S-transferase levels compared with brown males, indicating enhanced stress in black males. Foster offspring of black males had a lower ratio between reduced and oxidized GSH followed by higher total amount of GSH than foster offspring of brown males. Thus, foster offspring of black males seem to suffer from oxidative stress under relatively cold weather compared with those of brown males, and vice versa under relatively warm weather. Although differently colored males experienced changes in their oxidative status under different temperatures, the link between paternal melanin coloration and offspring oxidative stress appears to be environmentally induced.","keywords":"Environmental heterogeneity, Genetic quality, Genotype-by-environment interaction, Oxidative stress, Phenotypic variation, Phenotypic quality, Sexual selection, Secondary sexual trait","title":"Elevated oxidative stress in pied flycatcher nestlings of eumelanic foster fathers under low rearing temperatures","authors":"P.

CRUs are formed by clusters of channels called ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) within the cardiomyocyte. Distances between CRUs influence the diffusion of Ca2+, thus influencing the rate and strength of excitation–contraction coupling. Avian myocytes lack T-tubules, so Ca2+ from surface CRUs (peripheral couplings, PCs) must diffuse to internal CRU sites of the corbular SR (cSR) during centripetal propagation. Despite this, avian hearts achieve higher contractile rates and develop greater contractile strength than many mammalian hearts, which have T-tubules to provide simultaneous activation of the Ca2+ signal through the myocyte. We used 3D electron tomography to test the hypothesis that the intracellular distribution of CRUs in the avian heart permits faster and stronger contractions despite the absence of T-tubules. Nearest edge–edge distances between PCs and cSR, and geometric information including surface area and volume of individual cSR, were obtained for each cardiac chamber of the white leghorn chicken. Computational modelling was then used to establish a relationship between CRU distance and cell activation time in the avian heart. Our data suggest that cSR clustered close together along the Z-line is vital for rapid propagation of the Ca2+ signal from the cell periphery to the cell centre, which would aid in the strong and fast contractions of the avian heart.","keywords":"Bird, Chicken, Computational model, Calcium diffusion, Electron tomography, Peripheral coupling","title":"3D ultrastructural organisation of calcium release units in the avian sarcoplasmic reticulum","authors":"Thomas M.

Yet, morph-specific costs and benefits related to different life-history strategies remain unclear. Here, we examined in the polymorphic Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) whether markers of somatic maintenance (body mass, oxidative status and telomere length) differed between red- and black-headed birds under energetically demanding conditions (during heatwaves of different intensity, and during moult or breeding following heatwaves). During heatwaves, red-headed birds showed a homogeneous response, as males and females initially tended to gain mass and had reduced plasma hydroperoxide levels (a marker of oxidative damage) irrespective of heatwave intensity. In contrast, black-headed birds showed a stronger and more heterogeneous response, as black-headed males gained mass at the beginning of the thermoneutral heatwave and showed stable oxidative status, whereas black-headed females lost mass and tended to show higher hydroperoxide levels at the end of the thermocritical heatwave. Following heatwaves, we found morph-specific oxidative costs owing to moult or reproduction, with oxidative markers varying only in black-headed birds. Again, oxidative markers varied differently in black-headed males and females, as plasma antioxidant capacity decreased in moulting or breeding females, whereas males showed higher hydroperoxide levels with larger broods. For the first time, our study highlights that within polymorphic species, some individuals appear more vulnerable than others when coping with energetically demanding conditions. In the context of climate change, such differential effects may ultimately alter the currently observed balance between morphs and sexes within natural populations.","keywords":"Body mass variation, Endogenous traits, Inter-morphic variability, Moult-breeding strategy, Oxidative status, Telomere shortening","title":"Morph- and sex-specific effects of challenging conditions on maintenance parameters in the Gouldian finch","authors":"Rita Fragueira, Simon Verhulst, Michaël Beaulieu","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"1 April 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/7/jeb193243","abstract":"Metabolic rate (MR) often scales with body mass (BM) following a power function of the form MR=aBMb, where log(a) is the allometric intercept and b is the allometric exponent (i.e. slope on a log–log scale).

Individuals acclimated to 0°C showed much lower values than the other two acclimation treatments (15°C and fluctuating 0-15°C). Performance breadth (the index of the breadth of the curve, Tbr) typically showed little response to acclimation. None of the traits of the supralittoral species were affected by acclimation treatment. Responses to stable and fluctuating temperature treatments were similar.

Although early embryonic uptake of yolk androgens is suggested by the presence of radioactivity in the embryo when eggs are injected with radiolabelled androgens, these studies do not verify the chemical identity of radioactive compound(s), although it is known that these androgens can be metabolized substantially. By using stable isotope-labelled testosterone and androstenedione in combination with mass spectrometry, enabling verification of the exact molecular identity of labelled compounds in the embryo, we found that after 5 days of incubation the androgens were not taken up by the embryo. However, their concentrations in the entire yolk albumen homogenates declined strongly, even when corrected for dilution by albumen and water. Our results indicate metabolism of maternal androgens, very likely to 5β-androstane-3α,17β-diol, etiocholanolone and their conjugated forms.

Ca2+ absorption appeared as a combination of active and passive movement, with Michaelis–Menten kinetics observable under symmetrical conditions, and was inhibited by several pharmacological agents (ouabain, La3+ and a calmodulin antagonist).

Increased Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and citrate synthase (CS) activity rates paralleled trends seen in Ca2+ transport. Feeding in freshwater and IPW exposure increased the glycolytic capacity of the caeca via increased pyruvate kinase (PK) and decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, while amino acid metabolism increased with IPW exposure through increased glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity. Overall, feeding and IPW exposure each altered ionoregulation within the caeca of freshwater rainbow trout in a zone-specific pattern, with the anterior and proximal portions of the caeca being most affected.

Hypoxic ventilatory responses were measured shortly after capture at the native altitude. In general, ducks responded to acute hypoxia with robust increases in total ventilation and pulmonary O2 extraction. O2 consumption rates were maintained or increased slightly in acute hypoxia, despite ∼1–2°C reductions in body temperature in most species. Two high-altitude taxa – yellow-billed pintail and torrent duck – exhibited higher total ventilation than their low-altitude counterparts, and yellow-billed pintail exhibited greater increases in pulmonary O2 extraction in severe hypoxia. In contrast, three other high-altitude taxa – Andean ruddy duck, Andean cinnamon teal and speckled teal – had similar or slightly reduced total ventilation and pulmonary O2 extraction compared with low-altitude relatives. Arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) was elevated in yellow-billed pintails at moderate levels of hypoxia, but there were no differences in SaO2 in other high-altitude taxa compared with their close relatives. This finding suggests that improvements in SaO2 in hypoxia can require increases in both breathing and haemoglobin–O2 affinity, because the yellow-billed pintail was the only high-altitude duck with concurrent increases in both traits compared with its low-altitude relative.

We aimed to quantify the impacts of shape (second moment of area) and tapering on the mechanical properties of the spine. We performed two-point bending at several positions along the spines of P. volitans to determine mechanical properties (Young's modulus, elastic energy storage and flexural stiffness). The short and recurved anal and pelvic spines are stiffer and resist bending more effectively than the long dorsal spines. In addition, mechanical properties differ along the length of the spines, most likely because they are tapered. We hypothesize that the highly bendable dorsal spines are used for intimidation, making the fish look larger. The stiffer and energy-absorbing anal and pelvic spines are smaller and less numerous, but they may be used for protection as they are located near important internal structures such as the swim bladder. Lastly, spine second moment of area varies across the Pterois genus.

These effects were most probably conditioned by temperature-dependent alterations in egg white pH and AMP concentrations. While lysozyme concentration and pH decreased in fully incubated precocial but not altricial eggs, egg white ovotransferrin increased along with the intensity of incubation in both precocial and altricial eggs. This study is the first to experimentally demonstrate that different incubation patterns may have selective antimicrobial potential mediated by species-specific effects on antimicrobial components in the egg white.","keywords":"Trans-shell infection, Albumen, Antimicrobials, Incubation onset, Embryo viability","title":"Different incubation patterns affect selective antimicrobial properties of the egg interior: experimental evidence from eggs of precocial and altricial birds","authors":"Jana Svobodová, Lucie Šmídová, Veronika Gvoždíková Javůrková","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"27 March 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/6/jeb200055","abstract":"An effective immune response results in the elimination of pathogens, but this immunological benefit may be accompanied by increased levels of oxidative damage. However, organisms have evolved mechanisms to mitigate the extent of such oxidative damage, including the production and mobilization of antioxidants. One potential mechanism of mitigating immune challenge-induced changes in oxidative physiology is increasing biliverdin production. Biliverdin is chemically an antioxidant, but within-tissue correlations between biliverdin concentration and oxidative damage have never been directly examined. To test how biliverdin tissue concentrations are associated with physiological responses to an immune challenge, we exposed northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) to one of four treatments: injection of a non-pathogenic antigen – either lipopolysaccharide or phytohemagglutinin, control injection of phosphate-buffered saline or a sham procedure with no injection. Twenty-four hours later, we quantified oxidative damage and triglyceride concentration in the plasma, and biliverdin concentration in the plasma, liver and spleen. We found that both types of immune challenge increased oxidative damage relative to both non-injected and vehicle-injected controls, but treatment had no effects on any other metric. However, across all birds, oxidative damage and biliverdin concentration in the plasma were negatively correlated, which is consistent with a localized antioxidant function of biliverdin. Additionally, we uncovered multiple links between biliverdin concentration, change in mass during the immune challenges and triglyceride levels, suggesting that pathways associated with biliverdin production may also be associated with aspects of nutrient mobilization. Future experiments that manipulate biliverdin levels or oxidative damage directly could establish a systemic antioxidant function or elucidate important physiological impacts on body mass maintenance and triglyceride storage, mobilization or transport.","keywords":"LPS, Metabolism, Nutrient, Oxidative stress, PHA, Triglyceride","title":"Immune challenge-induced oxidative damage may be mitigated by biliverdin","authors":"Jessica L.

One of the most extraordinary was the loss of the major oxygen carrier hemoglobin (Hb) in the icefishes (family Channichthyidae). Although the mechanisms of this loss and the resulting compensatory changes have been well studied, the impact of Hb loss on the network of genes that once supported its recycling and disposal has remained unexplored. Here, we report the functional fate and underlying molecular changes of two such key Hb-supporting proteins across the icefish family – haptoglobin (Hp) and hemopexin (Hx), crucial in removing cytotoxic free Hb and heme, respectively. Hp plays a critical role in binding free Hb for intracellular recycling and absent its primary client, icefish Hp transcription is now vanishingly little, and translation into a functional protein is nearly silenced. Hp genotype degeneration has manifested in separate lineages of the icefish phylogeny with three distinct nonsense mutations and a deletion frame shift, as well as mutated polyadenylation signal sequences. Thus, Hb loss appears to have diminished selective constraint on Hp maintenance, resulting in its stochastic, co-evolutionary drift towards extinction. Hx binds free heme for iron recycling in hepatocytes. In contrast to Hp, Hx genotype integrity is preserved in the icefishes and transcription occurs at levels comparable to those in the red-blooded notothenioids. The persistence of Hx likely owes to continued selective pressure for its function from mitochondrial and non-Hb cellular hemoproteins.","keywords":"Notothenioid, Channichthyidae, Relaxed selection","title":"A tale of two genes: divergent evolutionary fate of haptoglobin and hemopexin in hemoglobinless Antarctic icefishes","authors":"Kevin T.

Energy savings can thus be directed to migratory movement. However, direct measurements of total roosting energy expenditure in relation to ambient and body temperature are lacking. We captured migratory silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans; ∼11 g) at Long Point, ON, Canada, in spring and autumn 2016. We used quantitative magnetic resonance analysis to measure body composition change and energy expenditure over a 12 h roosting period in a ventilated incubator at 10, 17 and 25°C. We assessed the effects of season, body mass, sex and age on energy expenditure. We found that daily energy expenditure was independent of roosting temperature, and that this was achieved by flexible use of torpor. Variation in body mass at capture was driven mainly by differences in fat, and the amount of body fat was negatively related to torpor use, particularly in spring. Season, sex and age also affected torpor use and energy expenditure, notably with pregnant females being generally fatter and using less torpor than males in spring. We estimate that stopover contributes only 15–20% to the total energy costs of migration in bats compared with 70% or more in typical birds.

Little is known on how animals negotiate such terrain variability at high speed. We investigated this in fast-running Acanthodactylus boskianus lizards, by measuring their 3D kinematics using four synchronised high-speed video cameras (325 Hz) on an adaptable racetrack. This racetrack was covered with four different substrates, representing increasing levels of terrain complexity. We found that the lizards deal with this complexity gradient by gradually adopting more erect parasagittal leg postures. Legs in a more-erect position are more compliant and are therefore highly adjustable on complex terrains. Additionally, the lizards stabilise their head, which facilitates vestibular and visual perception. Together, compliant legs and head stabilisation enable the lizards to minimise movements of the body centre of mass, even when running on highly irregular terrains. This suggests that the head and the centre of mass are the priority targets for running on uneven terrains. As a result, running performance (mean forward speed) decreases only slightly, and only on the most challenging substrate under investigation.","keywords":"Acanthodactylus boskianus, Acanthodactylus boskianus, Compliant leg, Head stabilisation, Substrate variation, Body dynamics, Control strategy","title":"Compliant legs enable lizards to maintain high running speeds on complex terrains","authors":"François Druelle, Jana Goyens, Menelia Vasilopoulou-Kampitsi, Peter Aerts","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"21 March 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/6/jeb187039","abstract":"Stress exposure during prenatal and postnatal development can have persistent and often dysfunctional effects on several physiological systems, including immune function, affecting the ability to combat infection. The neuroimmune response is inextricably linked to the action of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Cytokines released from neuroimmune cells, including microglia, activate the HPA axis, while glucocorticoids in turn regulate cytokine release from microglia. Because of the close links between these two physiological systems, coupled with potential for persistent changes to HPA axis activity following developmental stress, components of the neuroimmune system could be targets for developmental programming. However, little is known of any programming effects of developmental stress on neuroimmune function. We investigated whether developmental stress exposure via elevated prenatal corticosterone (CORT) or postnatal unpredictable food availability had long-term effects on pro- (IL-1β) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokine and microglia-dependent gene (CSF1R) expression within HPA axis tissues in a precocial bird, the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Following postnatal stress, we observed increased IL-1β expression in the pituitary gland, reduced IL-10 expression in the amygdala and hypothalamus, and reduced CSF1R expression within the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Postnatal stress disrupted the ratio of IL-1β:IL-10 expression within the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Prenatal stress only increased IL-1β expression in the pituitary gland. We found no evidence for interactive or cumulative effects across life stages on basal cytokine and glia expression in adulthood. We show that postnatal stress may have a larger impact than elevated prenatal CORT on basal immunity in HPA-axis-specific brain regions, with changes in cytokine homeostasis and microglia abundance. These results provide evidence for postnatal programming of a pro-inflammatory neuroimmune phenotype at the expense of reduced microglia, which could have implications for central nervous system health and subsequent neuroimmune responses.","keywords":"Cytokines, Developmental programming, Glucocorticoids, Neuroinflammation, Anti-inflammatory, Neuroimmune","title":"Early-life adversity programs long-term cytokine and microglia expression within the HPA axis in female Japanese quail","authors":"David J.

Ten young men completed 6 experimental sessions (3 fatiguing exercises×2 types of fatigue measurements). The fatiguing exercises were: a 30-s all out (WING), 10-min at severe-intensity (SEV) and 90-min at moderate-intensity (MOD). Relative Pmax decreased more than IMVC after WING (p=0.005) while the opposite was found after SEV (p=0.005) and MOD tasks (p<0.001). There was no difference between the decrease in IMVC and Tmax after the WING, but IMVC decreased more than Tmax immediately following and during the recovery from the SEV (p=0.042) and MOD exercises (p<0.001). Depression of MRFD was greater than Vmax after all the fatiguing exercises and during recovery (all p<0.05). Despite the general definition of fatigue, isometric assessment of fatigue is not interchangeable with dynamic assessment following dynamic exercises with large muscle mass of different intensities, i.e. the results from isometric function cannot be used to estimate dynamic function and vice-versa.

To help understand this decline, we quantified the biomechanical performance of wild northern quolls as they ran up inclined narrow (13 mm pole) and inclined wide (90 mm platform) substrates. We predicted that quolls may possess biomechanical adaptations to increase stability on narrow surfaces, which are more common in rocky habitats. Our results showed that quolls have some biomechanical characteristics consistent with a stability advantage on narrow surfaces. This includes the coupled use of limb pairs, as indicated via a decrease in footfall time, and an ability to produce corrective torques to counteract the toppling moments commonly encountered during gait on narrow surfaces. However, speed was constrained on narrow surfaces, and quolls did not adopt diagonal sequence gaits, unlike true arboreal specialists such as primates. In comparison with key predators, such as cats and dogs, northern quolls appear inferior in terrestrial environments but have a stability advantage at higher speeds on narrow supports. This may partially explain the heterogeneous declines in northern quoll populations among various habitats on mainland Australia.","keywords":"Performance, Northern quoll, Torque, Substrate reaction force, Kinematics, Kinetics","title":"Moving in complex environments: a biomechanical analysis of locomotion on inclined and narrow substrates","authors":"Christofer J.

Here, we examined metabolic rate, gut passage time, assimilation efficiency and fuel use in the lizard Agama atra digesting cricket meals at three ecologically relevant temperatures (20, 25 and 32°C). Crickets were isotopically enriched with 13C-leucine or 13C-palmitic-acid tracers to distinguish between protein and lipid oxidation, respectively. Our results show that higher temperatures increased the magnitude of the SDA peak (by 318% between 32 and 20°C) and gut passage rate (63%), and decreased the duration of the SDA response (by 20% for males and 48% for females). Peak rate of dietary protein oxidation occurred sooner than peak lipid oxidation at all temperatures (70, 60 and 31 h earlier for 20, 25 and 32°C, respectively). Assimilation efficiency of proteins, but not lipids, was positively related to temperature. Interestingly, the SDA response exhibited a notable circadian rhythm.

A prior residence effect of marbled crayfish was analysed quantitatively in the present study. More than 2 h of residency in a shelter was sufficient for small owners to defeat large intruders. Small animals that stayed in a shelter for 24 h still tended to win following removal of the shelter 10 min before pairing with large intruders, but 2 h residents were occasionally beaten by large intruders without the support of shelters during pairings. The prior residence effect thus developed depending on the duration of residency. To clarify whether the strength of the prior residence effect was affected by the quality of a shelter, large and small owners with different combinations of high- and low-quality shelters were paired. When both large and small owners possessed a high-quality shelter, the frequency of agonistic bouts was reduced. Even if agonistic bouts occurred, the win frequency of small owners was almost equal to that of large owners. Thus, the residence effect on small owners was sufficiently strong to overcome the physical disadvantage of small animals to large opponents. By contrast, small owners of low­-quality shelters were frequently beaten by large owners with the shelters of same or better quality.

Upon re-oxygenation, the preferential oxidation of accumulated succinate most often impairs mitochondrial function. Few species can survive prolonged periods of hypoxia and anoxia at tropical temperatures and those that do may rely on mitochondria plasticity in response to disruptions to oxygen availability. Two carpet sharks, the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) and the grey carpet shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) display different adaptive responses to prolonged anoxia: while H. ocellatum enters energy-conserving metabolic depression, C. punctatum temporarily elevates its haematocrit, prolonging oxygen delivery. High-resolution respirometry was used to investigate mitochondrial function in the cerebellum, a highly metabolically active organ that is oxygen sensitive and vulnerable to injury after anoxia/re-oxygenation (AR). Succinate was titrated into cerebellar preparations in vitro, with or without pre-exposure to AR, then the activity of mitochondrial complexes was examined. As in most vertebrates, C. punctatum mitochondria significantly increased succinate oxidation rates, with impaired complex I function post-AR. In contrast, H. ocellatum mitochondria inhibited succinate oxidation rates and both complex I and II capacities were conserved, resulting in preservation of oxidative phosphorylation capacity post-AR. Divergent mitochondrial plasticity elicited by elevated succinate post-AR parallels the inherently divergent physiological adaptations of these animals to prolonged anoxia, namely the absence (C. punctatum) and presence (H. ocellatum) of metabolic depression. As anoxia tolerance in these species also occurs at temperatures close to that for humans, examining their mitochondrial responses to AR could provide insights for novel interventions in clinical settings.","keywords":"Mitochondria, Anoxia tolerance, Succinate, Brain, Shark, Oxygen","title":"Mitochondrial plasticity in the cerebellum of two anoxia-tolerant sharks: contrasting responses to anoxia/re-oxygenation","authors":"Jules B.

Fish living in turbid water had higher proportions of vitamin A2, shifting sensitivities to longer wavelengths, than fish living in clear water.

Currently, the most common explanation for how carotenoid coloration serves as a reliable signal of condition is the resource trade-off hypothesis, which proposes that use of carotenoids for ornaments reduces their availability for use by the immune system or for protection from oxidative damage. However, two main assumptions of the hypothesis remain in question: whether carotenoids boost the performance of internal processes such as immune and antioxidant defenses, and whether allocating carotenoids to ornaments imposes a trade-off with such benefits. In this study, we tested these two fundamental assumptions using types of domestic canary (Serinus canaria domestica) that enable experiments in which carotenoid availability and allocation can be tightly controlled. Specifically, we assessed metrics of immune and antioxidant performance in three genetic variants of the color-bred canary that differ only in carotenoid phenotype: ornamented, carotenoid-rich yellow canaries; unornamented, carotenoid-rich ‘white dominant’ canaries; and unornamented, carotenoid-deficient ‘white recessive’ canaries. The resource trade-off hypothesis predicts that carotenoid-rich individuals should outperform carotenoid-deficient individuals and that birds that allocate carotenoids to feathers should pay a cost in the form of reduced immune function or greater oxidative stress compared with unornamented birds. We found no evidence to support either prediction; all three canary types performed equally across measures. We suggest that testing alternative mechanisms for the honesty of carotenoid-based coloration should be a key focus of future studies of carotenoid-based signaling in birds.","keywords":"Condition-dependent trait, Immunocompetence, Antioxidant, Ornament","title":"Testing the resource trade-off hypothesis for carotenoid-based signal honesty using genetic variants of the domestic canary","authors":"Rebecca E.

The results revealed that, in B. constrictor: (1) the orthostatic tachycardia is initially mediated by a decrease in cholinergic tone followed by an increase in adrenergic tone, a pattern that may be evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates; (2) the orthostatic tachycardia is important for avoiding an intense decrease in PA at the beginning of body inclinations; and (3) α1-adrenergic orthostatic vasomotor responses are important for the maintenance of PA at satisfactory values during long-term inclinations.","keywords":"Arterial blood pressure, Autonomic nervous system, Heart rate, Orthostatic hypotension, Orthostatic tachycardia, Vasomotion","title":"Autonomic control of cardiovascular adjustments associated with orthostasis in the scansorial snake Boa constrictor","authors":"Vinicius Araújo Armelin, Victor Hugo da Silva Braga, Igor Noll Guagnoni, Ariela Maltarolo Crestani, Augusto Shinya Abe, Luiz Henrique Florindo","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"12 March 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/5/jeb190850","abstract":"When exposed to anoxia, insects rapidly go into a hypometabolic coma from which they can recover when exposed to normoxia again. However, prolonged anoxic bouts eventually lead to death in most insects, although some species are surprisingly tolerant. Anoxia challenges ATP, ion, pH and water homeostasis, but it is not clear how fast and to what degree each of these parameters is disrupted during anoxia, nor how quickly they recover. Further, it has not been investigated which disruptions are the primary source of the tissue damage that ultimately causes death. Here, we show, in the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), that prolonged anoxic exposures are associated with increased recovery time, decreased survival, rapidly disrupted ATP and pH homeostasis and a slower disruption of ion ([K+] and [Na+]) and water balance. Locusts could not fully recover after 4 h of anoxia at 30°C, and at this point hemolymph [K+] was elevated 5-fold and [Na+] was decreased 2-fold, muscle [ATP] was decreased to ≤3% of normoxic values, hemolymph pH had dropped 0.8 units from 7.3 to 6.5, and hemolymph water content was halved. These physiological changes are associated with marked tissue damage in vivo and we show that the isolated and combined effects of hyperkalemia, acidosis and anoxia can all cause muscle tissue damage in vitro to equally large degrees. When locusts were returned to normoxia after a moderate (2 h) exposure of anoxia, ATP recovered rapidly (15 min) and this was quickly followed by recovery of ion balance (30 min), while pH recovery took 2–24 h. Recovery of [K+] and [Na+] coincided with the animals exiting the comatose state, but recovery to an upright position took ∼90 min and was not related to any of the physiological parameters examined.","keywords":"Anoxia tolerance, Anoxic stress, Ion homeostasis, Extracellular potassium, Migratory locust","title":"Effects of anoxia on ATP, water, ion and pH balance in an insect (Locusta migratoria)","authors":"Mathias V.

Expression of Tyrosinase Related Protein 1 (TYRP1), Solute Carrier Family 45 member 2 (SLC45A2) and Hematopoietic Prostaglandin D Synthase (HPGDS) was melanocyte-limited and significantly reduced in follicles from hooded crow, explaining the substantially lower eumelanin content in grey versus black feathers.

These changes in gene expression can be quantitative, as a result of increases or decreases in the amounts of specific transcripts, or qualitative, as a result of the expression of alternative transcripts from the same gene (e.g. via alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs). Although the role of quantitative changes in gene expression in phenotypic plasticity is well known, relatively few studies have examined the role of qualitative changes. Here, we use skeletal muscle RNA-seq data from Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate the extent of qualitative changes in gene expression in response to cold acclimation. Fewer genes demonstrated alternative splicing than differential expression as a result of cold acclimation; however, differences in splicing were detected for 426 to 866 genes depending on species, indicating that large numbers of qualitative changes in gene expression are associated with cold acclimation. Many of these alternatively spliced genes were also differentially expressed, and there was functional enrichment for involvement in muscle contraction among the genes demonstrating qualitative changes in response to cold acclimation. Additionally, there was a common group of 29 genes with cold-acclimation-mediated changes in splicing in all three species, suggesting that there may be a set of genes with expression patterns that respond qualitatively to prolonged exposure to cold temperatures across fishes.","keywords":"Temperature, Differential exon usage, Phenotypic plasticity, Killifish, Stickleback, Zebrafish","title":"Patterns of alternative splicing in response to cold acclimation in fish","authors":"Timothy M.

In twelve young males, work done at each step over 50 m from the start was calculated from mechanical energy changes in horizontal anterior–posterior and vertical directions and was divided into braking (−Wkap and −Wv, respectively) and propulsive (+Wkap and +Wv, respectively) phases. The maximal running velocity (Vmax) appeared at 35.87±7.76 m and the time required to run 50 m (T50 m) was 7.11±0.54 s. At 80% Vmax or higher, +Wkap largely decreased and −Wkap abruptly increased. The change in the difference between +Wkap and |−Wkap| (ΔWkap) at every step was relatively small at 70% Vmax or lower. Total work done over 50 m was 82.4±7.5 J kg−1 for +Wkap, 36.2±4.4 J kg−1 for |−Wkap|, 14.3±1.9 J kg−1 for +Wv, and 10.4±1.2 J kg−1 for |−Wv|. The total ΔWkap over 50 m was more strongly correlated with T50 m (r=−0.946, P<0.0001) than the corresponding associations for the other work variables. These results indicate that in maximal sprint running over 50 m, work done during the propulsive phase in the horizontal anterior–posterior direction accounts for the majority of the total external work done during the acceleration stage, and maximizing it while suppressing work done during the braking phase is essential to achieve a high running performance.","keywords":"50 m force plate system, Ground reaction force, Propulsive and braking phases, Positive and negative work","title":"External mechanical work done during the acceleration stage of maximal sprint running and its association with running performance","authors":"Akifumi Matsuo, Mirai Mizutani, Ryu Nagahara, Testuo Fukunaga, Hiroaki Kanehisa","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"7 March 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/5/jeb198457","abstract":"The retia mirabilia are vascular nets composed of small vessels dispersed among numerous veins, allowing blood storage, regulation of flow and pressure damping effects.

To this effect, the whole vertebral retia mirabilia of a series of dolphins were removed during post-mortem analysis and examined to assess vessel diameters, and estimate vascular volume and flow rate. We formulated a new hemodynamic model to help clarify vascular dynamics throughout the diving phase, based on the total blood volume of a bottlenose dolphin, and using data available about the perfusion of the main organs and body systems. We computed the minimum blood perfusion necessary to the internal organs, and the stroke volume and cardiac output during the surface state. We then simulated breath-holding conditions and perfusion of the internal organs under the diving-induced bradycardia and reduction of stroke volume and cardiac output, using 10 beats min−1 as the limit for the heart rate for an extended dive of over 3 min. Within these simulated conditions, the retia mirabilia play a vital role as reservoirs of oxygenated blood that permit functional performances and survival of the heart and brain. Our theoretical model, based on the actual blood capacity of the retia mirabilia and available data on organ perfusion, considers the dynamic trend of vasoconstriction during the diving phase and may represent a baseline for future studies on the diving physiology of dolphins and especially for the blood supply to their brain.","keywords":"Rete mirabilis, Cetacean, Stroke volume, Cardiac output","title":"Dynamics of blood circulation during diving in the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus): the role of the retia mirabilia","authors":"Marco Bonato, Paola Bagnoli, Cinzia Centelleghe, Mike Maric, Ginevra Brocca, Sandro Mazzariol, Bruno Cozzi","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"7 March 2019"},{"link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/5/jeb190637","abstract":"This study measured the degree of behavioral responses in blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) to controlled noise exposure off the southern California coast. High-resolution movement and passive acoustic data were obtained from non-invasive archival tags (n=42) whereas surface positions were obtained with visual focal follows. Controlled exposure experiments (CEEs) were used to obtain direct behavioral measurements before, during and after simulated and operational military mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS), pseudorandom noise (PRN) and controls (no noise exposure). For a subset of deep-feeding animals (n=21), active acoustic measurements of prey were obtained and used as contextual covariates in response analyses. To investigate potential behavioral changes within individuals as a function of controlled noise exposure conditions, two parallel analyses of time-series data for selected behavioral parameters (e.g. diving, horizontal movement and feeding) were conducted. This included expert scoring of responses according to a specified behavioral severity rating paradigm and quantitative change-point analyses using Mahalanobis distance statistics. Both methods identified clear changes in some conditions. More than 50% of blue whales in deep-feeding states responded during CEEs, whereas no changes in behavior were identified in shallow-feeding blue whales. Overall, responses were generally brief, of low to moderate severity, and highly dependent on exposure context such as behavioral state, source-to-whale horizontal range and prey availability. Response probability did not follow a simple exposure–response model based on received exposure level. These results, in combination with additional analytical methods to investigate different aspects of potential responses within and among individuals, provide a comprehensive evaluation of how free-ranging blue whales responded to mid-frequency military sonar.","keywords":"Sonar, Marine mammal, Behavioral state, Foraging ecology, Endangered, Context","title":"Behavioral responses of individual blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) to mid-frequency military sonar","authors":"Brandon L.

Many marine animals exhibit behavioral flexibility when feeding to deal with spatial and temporal heterogeneity in prey resources. However, little is known about flexibility in the feeding behavior of many large marine predators. Here, we documented the feeding behavior and kinematics of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi, n=7) through controlled feeding trials. Seals were fed multiple prey types (e.g. night smelt, capelin, squid and herring) that varied in size and shape to examine behavioral flexibility in feeding. Hawaiian monk seals primarily used suction feeding (91% of all feeding trials) across all prey types, but biting, specifically pierce feeding, was also observed (9% of all feeding trials). Suction feeding was characterized by shorter temporal events, a smaller maximum gape and gape angle, and a fewer number of jaw motions than pierce feeding; suction feeding kinematic performance was also more variable compared with pierce feeding. Seals showed behavioral flexibility in their use of the two strategies. Suction feeding was used most frequently when targeting small to medium sized prey and biting was used with increasing frequency on larger prey. The feeding kinematics differed between feeding strategies and prey types, showing that Hawaiian monk seals adjusted their behaviors to particular feeding contexts. Hawaiian monk seals are opportunistic marine predators and their ability to adapt their feeding strategy and behavior to specific foraging scenarios allows them to target diverse prey resources.","keywords":"Suction, Biting, Foraging, Feeding, Pinniped, Kinematics","title":"Hawaiian monk seals exhibit behavioral flexibility when targeting prey of different size and shape","authors":"Sarah S.

Astrangia poculata is a temperate scleractinian coral that provides unique opportunities to understand the roles of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation in coral physiological tolerance limits. This species inhabits hard-bottom ecosystems from the northwestern Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico and withstands an annual temperature range of up to 20°C. Additionally, A. poculata is facultatively symbiotic and co-occurs in both symbiotic (‘brown’) and aposymbiotic (‘white’) states. Here, brown and white A. poculata were collected from Virginia (VA) and Rhode Island (RI), USA, and exposed to heat (18–32°C) and cold (18–6°C) stress, during which respiration of the coral host along with photosynthesis and photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of Breviolum psygmophilum photosymbionts were measured. Thermal performance curves (TPCs) of respiration revealed a pattern of countergradient variation with RI corals exhibiting higher respiration rates overall, and specifically at 6, 15, 18, 22 and 26°C. Additionally, thermal optimum (Topt) analyses show a 3.8°C (brown) and 6.9°C (white) higher Topt in the VA population, corresponding to the warmer in situ thermal environment in VA. In contrast to respiration, no origin effect was detected in photosynthesis rates or Fv/Fm, suggesting a possible host-only signature of adaptation. This study is the first to consider A. poculata’s response to both heat and cold stress across symbiotic states and geography, and provides insight into the potential evolutionary mechanisms behind the success of this species along the East Coast of the USA.","keywords":"Facultative symbiosis, Thermal performance curve, Local adaptation, Countergradient variation, G matrix, Mitochondrial proliferation","title":"Adaptive signatures in thermal performance of the temperate coral Astrangia poculata","authors":"Hannah E.

We housed Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) females in two group sizes (pairs versus groups of four) and studied the effects on their offspring under matched and mismatched conditions. We measured F1 body mass, reproduction, and plasma levels of androgens and corticosterone. F1 group housing led to an increase in body mass. In addition, F1 group housing had a positive effect on mass in daughters of pair-housed P0 females only, which were heaviest under mismatched conditions. At the time of egg collection for the F2 generation, F1 group-housed females were heavier, irrespective of the P0 treatment. F1 females in groups laid heavier eggs, with higher hatching success, and produced heavier offspring, most likely a maternal effect of F1 mass. F1 plasma hormones were affected by neither the P0 nor the F1 social environment. These results contrasted with effects in the P0 generation (reported previously), in which plasma hormone levels, but not mass, differed between social environments. This may be due to changes in adult sex ratios as P0 females were housed with males, whereas F1 females encountered males only during mating. Our study demonstrates potentially relevant mismatch effects of the social environment on F1 body mass and maternal effects on F2 offspring, but further study is needed to understand their adaptive significance and physiological mechanisms.","keywords":"Transgenerational effects, Group size, Reproductive investment, Steroid hormones, Physiology, Morphology","title":"Effects of the maternal and current social environment on female body mass and reproductive traits in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica)","authors":"Esther M.
