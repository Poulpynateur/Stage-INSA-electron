Although a superior performance of the LGMD in the detection of intercepting objects has been shown in many collision avoiding scenarios, its direct integration with motion control is an unexplored topic. In our work, we propose to utilize the LGMD neural network for visual interception detection with a central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion control of a hexapod walking robot that are combined in the controller based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. Moreover, we propose self-supervised learning of the integrated controller to autonomously find a suitable setting of the system using a realistic robotic simulator. Thus, individual neural networks are trained in a simulation to enhance the performance of the controller that is then experimentally verified with a real hexapod walking robot in both collision and interception avoidance scenario and navigation in a cluttered environment.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046002"},{"title":"Flow field perception based on the fish lateral line system","authors":"Yonggang Jiang, Zhiqiang Ma, Deyuan Zhang","origin":"Topical Review","pub_date":"3 May 2019","abstract":"Fish are able to perceive the surrounding weak flow and pressure variations with their mechanosensory lateral line system, which consists of a superficial lateral line for flow velocity detection and a canal lateral line for flow pressure gradient perception.

Although robotic fish have been well studied, including algorithms to simulate group swimming, experiments that demonstrate multiple robotic fish as a stable group are yet to be achieved. One of the challenges is the lack of a robust bottom-level motion control system for robotic fish platforms. Here we seek to overcome this challenge by focusing on the design and implementation of a motion controller for robotic fish that allows multiple individuals to swim in groups. As direction control is essential in motion control, we first propose a high-accuracy controller which can control a sub-carangiform robotic fish from one arbitrary position/pose (position and direction) to another. We then develop a hydrodynamic-model-based simulation platform to expedite the process of the parameter tuning of the controller. The accuracy of the simulation platform was assessed by comparing the results from experiments on a robotic fish using speeding and turning tests. Subsequently, extensive simulations and experiments with robotic fish were used to verify the accuracy and robustness of the bottom-level motion control. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our controller by implementing group swimming using three robotic fish swimming freely in prescribed trajectories. Although the fluid environment can be complex during group swimming, our bottom-level motion control remained nominally accurate and robust. This motion control strategy lays a solid foundation for further studies of group swimming with multiple robotic fish.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046001"},{"title":"Canal neuromasts enhance foraging in zebrafish (Danio rerio)","authors":"Andres Carrillo, Dan Van Le, Margaret Byron, Houshuo Jiang, Matthew J McHenry","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"10 April 2019","abstract":"Aquatic animals commonly sense flow using superficial neuromasts (SNs), which are receptors that extend from the body's surface. The lateral line of fishes is unique among these systems because it additionally possesses receptors, the canal neuromasts (CNs), that are recessed within a channel. The lateral line has inspired the development of engineered sensors and concepts in the analysis of flow fields for submersible navigation. The biophysics of CNs are known to be different from the SNs and thereby offer a distinct submodality. However, it is generally unclear whether CNs play a distinct role in behavior. We therefore tested whether CNs enhance foraging in the dark by zebrafish (Danio rerio), a behavior that we elicited with a vibrating rod. We found that juvenile fish, which have only SNs, bite at this rod at about one-third the rate and from as little as one-third the distance of adults for a high-frequency stimulus (50  <  f   <  100 Hz). We used novel techniques for manipulating the lateral line in adults to find that CNs offered only a modest benefit at a lower frequency (20 Hz) and that foraging was mediated entirely by cranial neuromasts. Consistent with our behavioral results, biophysical models predicted CNs to be more than an order of magnitude more sensitive than SNs at high frequencies. This enhancement helps to overcome the rapid spatial decay in high-frequency components in the flow around the stimulus. These findings contrast what has been previously established for fishes that are at least ten-times the length of zebrafish, which use trunk CNs to localize prey. Therefore, CNs generally enhance foraging, but in a manner that varies with the size of the fish and its prey. These results have the potential to improve our understanding of flow sensing in aquatic animals and engineered systems.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/035003"},{"title":"Fluid-structure interaction modeling on a 3D ray-strengthened caudal fin","authors":"Guangyu Shi, Qing Xiao, Qiang Zhu, Wei Liao","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"10 April 2019","abstract":"In this paper, we present a numerical model capable of solving the fluid-structure interaction problems involved in the dynamics of skeleton-reinforced fish fins. In this model, the fluid dynamics is simulated by solving the Navier–Stokes equations using a finite-volume method based on an overset, multi-block structured grid system. The bony rays embedded in the fin are modeled as nonlinear Euler–Bernoulli beams. To demonstrate the capability of this model, we numerically investigate the effect of various ray stiffness distributions on the deformation and propulsion performance of a 3D caudal fin. Our numerical results show that with specific ray stiffness distributions, certain caudal fin deformation patterns observed in real fish (e.g. the cupping deformation) can be reproduced through passive structural deformations. Among the four different stiffness distributions (uniform, cupping, W-shape and heterocercal) considered here, we find that the cupping distribution requires the least power expenditure. The uniform distribution, on the other hand, performs the best in terms of thrust generation and efficiency. The uniform stiffness distribution, per se, also leads to 'cupping' deformation patterns with relatively smaller phase differences between various rays. The present model paves the way for future work on dynamics of skeleton-reinforced membranes.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/036012"},{"title":"Emergence of behavior through morphology: a case study on an octopus inspired manipulator","authors":"Thomas George Thuruthel, Egidio Falotico, Federico Renda, Tamar Flash, Cecilia Laschi","origin":"Note","pub_date":"24 April 2019","abstract":"The complex motion abilities of the Octopus vulgaris have been an intriguing research topic for biologists and roboticists alike.

These box-constrains are typically generated by designer interpretation of biomotion and anatomical studies or pragmatic fabrication constraints. In contrast to this standard design paradigm, this paper presents a methodology for learning joint geometry which restricts the range of motion of generic ball joints to only the reachable set observed during biomotion experiments. This reachable set is identified by constructing an analytical-empirical potential energy function over the experimental observations. The energy function effectively 'pushes' configurations close to the set of observations. This energy function is then thresholded to identify the zero-potential (ZP) configuration set, and joint geometry is constructed using the resulting contour. We construct an entire bat wing using this method, and demonstrate through motion capture experiments that the learned geometry successfully restricts motions to the ZP set.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/036013"},{"title":"Random sequential addition simulations of animal aggregations provide null models of group structure","authors":"Daniel Olsen, David W Murphy","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"8 April 2019","abstract":"Apparent structure in animal aggregations such as fish and Antarctic krill schools may result from the tight packing of these elongated animals.

Here we use random sequential addition (RSA) simulations to quantify the effect of animal shape, aggregation organization, and aggregation density on 2D school structure. This technique allows for the generation of a null model for nearest neighbor distance and nearest neighbor position angle for a specific body shape and aggregation density, thus isolating the effect of geometry from that of behavior. We further identify a shape-specific aggregation density threshold above which the animal shape affects the spatial distribution of nearest neighbors. Nearest neighbor distance data of fish schools with densities above and below the threshold are found to agree well with nearest neighbor statistics found from RSA-generated schools.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/035001"},{"title":"A bio-inspired electric camera for short-range object inspection in murky waters","authors":"Martin Gottwald, Hendrik Herzog, Gerhard von der Emde","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"8 April 2019","abstract":"Underwater object inspection by optical sensors is usually unreliable in turbid or dark environments. Here, we designed a biomimetic 'electric camera', inspired by weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii, which successfully use active electrolocation for this task. The device probed nearby objects with a weak electric field and captured 'electric images' of the targets by processing the object-evoked field modulations. The camera-based electric images strongly resembled those available to G. petersii. Furthermore, by extracting the fish's analytical cues from these images, close objects could be reliably analysed. Based on the level of 'image blurring' short distances of electrolocation targets, spheres of different sizes and material were estimated. Natural targets, fish or plants, were identified irrespective of their size or distance by their two individual 'electric colours' derived from electric images. Furthermore, we introduce an image cue, called the 'electric outline', which provided information resembling a target's optical contour. Our results indicate that bio-inspired electric imaging principles provide promising cues for sensor-based, short-range object inspections in murky waters. By resembling the electric imaging applied by G. petersii our device can also be used for 'reverse biomimetics', revealing imaging cues that so far have not been considered for weakly electric fish.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/035002"},{"title":"Musculoskeletal design, control, and application of human mimetic humanoid Kenshiro","authors":"Yuki Asano, Kei Okada, Masayuki Inaba","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"8 April 2019","abstract":"We have been developing a human mimetic musculoskeletal humanoid called Kenshiro, whose design concept is to thoroughly pursue an unprecedented anatomical fidelity to the human musculoskeletal structure.

Finally, we discuss our perspective of the technological challenges faced while improving flow sensitivity, durability, and sensing fusion schemes., Owing to the existence of harsh hydrodynamic environments with cluttered and murky water, in which underwater autonomous vehicles navigate, vision-based techniques may fail to detect the surroundings. Nature has developed and optimized an incredible variety of sensors for navigation, spatial orientation, predation, and object detection that provide engineers with new ideas for improving the current technologies, developing new sensors, and miniaturizing potential sensor [1]. Many examples of the successful application of biomimetic designs include microlens inspired by brittle stars [2], a digital camera mimicking the arthropod eye [3], tactile sensors inspired by the fine texture of human fingertips [4], flexible organic artificial afferent nerves [5], ultra-sensitive flow sensors with artificial Harbor seal whiskers [6], and biomimetic hair-like flow sensors [7]., Fish and aquatic amphibians are able to perceive minute fluid motions and pressure gradients with their mechanosensory lateral line system [8, 9]. It can assist these species in performing various functions such as schooling [10, 11], prey detection [12–14], communication [15, 16], and rheotaxis [17–21]. Inspired by the astonishing flow perception ability of the lateral line organs, many researchers have developed various artificial lateral line (ALL) sensors based on different sensing mechanisms including piezoresistive, piezoelectric, and optical detection schemes [7, 22, 23]. The sensitivity and detection threshold of ALL sensors benefit from the rapid progress in the fields of flexible electronics and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)., The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive review of biomimetic lateral line sensors, which includes a description of the basic sensing mechanisms of the biological lateral line and recent advances in the area of bioinspired sensors. In the first section, we describe the fish lateral line-based flow-sensing capabilities including the function, distribution, and morphology of the lateral line; highly sensitive flow-sensing mechanisms; and flow field sensing algorithms. In the second section, we discuss the technological approaches proposed in the literature for ALL sensors and their applications in underwater robots. Finally, we share our perspective on the technological challenges encountered during the practical implementation of ALL systems., The lateral line system consists of numerous neuromasts distributed non-uniformly over the entire fish body, as shown in figure 1(a). As functional units of the lateral line system, neuromasts are small receptor organs composed of mechanosensory hair and nonsensory cells (figure 1(b)). The hair bundle in an individual hair cell consists of a single kinocilium and several shorter stereocilia with graded lengths [24] (figures 1(b) and (c)). The ciliary bundles of all hair cells in an individual neuromast project into an enlarged transparent cupula that deflects the stereocilia and starts a transduction process of excitation or inhibition via mechanically sensitive ion channels, as shown in figure 1(d). The stereocilia are connected at their tips through tip links. Their bending towards the kinocilium initiates the transport of ions across the hair cell membrane, depolarizes it, and increases the firing rate of afferent neurons generating an excitatory response [25]. The bending of stereocilia away from the kinocilium in the opposite direction prevents the transport of ions, hyperpolarizes the hair cell membrane, and decreases the firing rate of neurons generating an inhibitory response., Figure 1. Lateral line system of fish.

(b) A diagram showing the microstructures of the individual neuromast composed of mechanosensory hair and nonsensory cells (mantle and supporting cells) covered by the gelatinous cupula. (c) A schematic diagram of the individual hair cell. The kinocilium supports the stereocilia and is capable of bending in response to saturating stimuli to maintain high sensitivity. The stereocilia deform in response to mechanical stimuli to change the tension on the tip-links, which affects the rate of neuron firing because of the change in the ion-valve position. Furthermore, the motor proteins connected to the tip-links also react to the tension (reproduced from [39] with permission of WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co. KGaA, Weinheim).

(e) A SN freestanding on the body surface, which is directly stimulated by the nearby flow field. (f) A CN located in the subepidermal fluid-filled lateral line canal connected to the ambient environment via canal pores., Download figure:, Based on their location, neuromasts in most teleost fish can be divided into two types: canal neuromasts (CNs) and superficial neuromasts (SNs) (figures 1(e) and (f)). As SNs are freestanding on the skin surface, the cupula interacts with external fluids directly and is sensitive to flow velocities. However, CNs are located in the subepidermal fluid-filled lateral line canals connected to the ambient environment via canal pores and thus are sensitive to the pressure gradients between two adjacent canal pores [26, 27]., The spatial distribution of neuromasts throughout the fish body determines the amplitude of the receptive field of the lateral line sensory system [28]. The distribution of CNs is limited because they are located within the lateral line canals. However, the distribution of SNs varies among different fish species as follows., In many teleost fish species, SNs are present on the head, trunk, and caudal fin and arranged in lines on the body surface [29]. On the head, SNs are dorsal and ventral as well as rostral and caudal to the eye, on the ventral mandible and in the opercular region [30, 31]. In the eyeless Chinese cavefish Sinocyclocheilus tianlinensis, SNs are distributed almost over the entire head [32]. SNs of the blind Mexican cavefish Astyanax mexicanus are also distributed almost over the entire head [33]. The proliferation of cephalic SNs in cavefish is likely a compensation for the absence of vision. On the tail, SNs are arranged in rostrocaudal rows. For instance, Schmitz et al investigated four Cyprinidae species and found that the SNs on the caudal fin in all fish species formed distinct rostrocaudal lines [31]., SNs are also distributed over the trunk body surface or closely associated with the lateral line canals. The results of previous studies show that the trunk superficial lateral line systems of fish inhabiting running water are closely associated with lateral line canals. This morphology is characteristic of Phoxinus phoxinus [31] and Cheimarrichthys fosteri [19, 34] species. In S. microphthalmus, which dwells in the karst caves of subterranean streams, the trunk SN system is closely associated with the lateral line canal [35]. The trunk SNs in S. macrophthalmus and S. tianlinensis cavefish are not randomly distributed over the body surface; however, they are closely associated with the lateral line canals [32]. The trunk SNs of the blind cavefish Astyanax mexicanus, which resides in still water, are distributed across the entire trunk [36]. Members of the North American cavefish family Amblyopsidae such as Speoplatyrhinus poulsoni prefer still water, and their trunk SNs are arranged in distinct elevated ridges that occupy nearly the entire trunk in the dorsoventral direction [37]. However, the trunk SNs of certain still water fish species including Rhodeus sericeus, Cobitis taenia, and Tinca tinca are closely associated with the lateral line canals [38]. Therefore, the trunk SN distribution is poorly correlated with the habitat. This conclusion is consistent with that of previous studies [31, 38]. Regardless of the trunk SNs distribution, some SNs are always closely associated with the lateral line canals, which may inspire a spatial arrangement of flow sensors., The cupula of a neuromast transmits the hydrodynamic forces produced by the flow of water near the body surface to deflect the hair bundles and thus generates a nervous response [41]. In previous studies, it was concluded that the cupula morphology could affect the mechanical sensitivity of SNs [42, 43]. Teyke characterized the cupula morphology of SNs in blind cavefish Astyanax hubbsi and sighted river fish Astyanax mexicanus via methylene blue vital staining [44]. He found that the cupula height varied with its neuromast location and that cephalic neuromasts had the highest cupula. He also concluded that the cephalic cupula heights in blind cavefish and sighted river fish were approximately 150 µm and 42 µm, respectively. Schmitz et al investigated the cupula morphology of SNs in goldfish (Carassius auratus) through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations [30]. The cupula bases were elongated along the long axis of the SNs, and the cupula lengths were approximately 40–45 µm. van Trump and McHenry measured the neuromast dimensions using a novel morphometric technique that recorded landmarks in three dimensions at a microscopic scale [45]. These measurements provided indirect evidence for significant variations of the cupula height. The obtained results also suggested that the natural variation in the cupular height within a species was capable of generating large differences in their mechanical filtering and dynamic ranges. Yoshizawa et al revealed the cupula morphology of SNs in blind cavefish Astyanax mexicanus using fluorescent polystyrene microspheres preferentially adhered to the cupula material [43]. The obtained results indicated that the cupula width and height of cavefish (Los Sabinos and Pachón) were significantly larger than those of surface fish., The greatest differences were observed for small fish. For instance, the median heights of the SN cupula within the eye orbits of the Los Sabinos (75 µm) and Pachón (76 µm) populations were twice as large as that of small surface fish (31 µm)., As sensory units of the neuromast, hair cells play an important role in perception. The results of previous studies indicate that the number of hair cells in a single SN can affect the SN sensitivity [42, 43]. Its magnitude can be obtained through SEM observations. Schmitz et al investigated the organization of the SN system in goldfish (Carassius auratus) in detail and determined that each SN had 14–32 hair cells that were arranged in a sensory epithelium with the axis of best sensitivity aligned perpendicularly to the long axis of the neuromast [30]. Ma et al found that the SN in sighted cavefish Sinocyclocheilus macrophthalmus possessed approximately 20 hair cells [32], as shown in figure 2(b). They also concluded that SNs in eyeless cavefish possessed more hair cells that that in sighted cavefish. Yoshizawa et al found that cavefish had more hair cells in an individual SN than surface fish using a motorized compound microscope with Nomarski illumination [43]. The surface fish consistently possessed neuromasts with fewer hair cells as compared with those of cavefish from both populations, and the number of hair cells in the neuromasts of large individuals was greater than that in the neuromasts of small individuals according to the results of most post hoc comparisons. These differences between the cavefish and surface fish are more pronounced for small fish. For the SNs located within the eye orbit, the number of hair cells in Los Sabinos (median of 38) was higher than that in Pachón (28), which in turn had more hair cells than that of surface fish (17)., Figure 2. Superficial lateral line system of fish.

(c) Enlarged image of panel (b) showing the hair bundle in the hair cell with a kinocilium (K) and stereocilia (S) [32]., Download figure:, The hair cell polarization of SNs, i.e. the axis of best sensitivity, is defined as the gradient direction of a hair bundle (figures 2(b) and (c)). SN orientation is determined by the angle between the best sensitivity direction of SNs and the long axis of the fish body (the rostrocaudal direction). The studies related to the orientations of SNs are limited to a few fish species, such as several Cyprinidae varieties [30–32], Umbra limi [47], Oreochromis aureus [27], and Lepisosteus platyrhincus [48]., On the fish head, the orientations of SNs are diverse. Schmitz et al described the SNs orientation of goldfish (Carassius auratus) in detail [30]. On the goldfish head, most SNs are arranged in rows or groups of similar orientations with angle deviations smaller than 45°. Neighboring groups of SNs can differ with respect to their orientation. The most frequent hair cell polarization was dorsoventral in front of the eyes and on the ventral mandible and rostrocaudal below the eye and on the operculum. In Gobius niger (Gobiidae) and Lepisosteus, SNs are arranged on the head in vertical columns and horizontal rows with rostrocaudal or dorsoventral orientations [49, 50]. In the notothenioid Trematomus sp., cephalic SNs are mainly oriented dorsoventrally, whereas on the operculum, they are mainly oriented rostrocaudally [51]. The various orientations of SNs on the fish head are not surprising because the head is not flat, and its surface exists in three dimensions. In addition, the lateral line canals on the head are not linear; therefore, if the SNs located in the vicinity of the canals are oriented parallel or perpendicularly to the canals, various orientations are expected. However, the functional significance of neuromast orientation patterns on the fish head has not been examined yet., Trunk SNs are arranged into dorsoventral rows, as shown in figure 1(a). The SNs within a row possess the same orientations, which are parallel or orthogonal to the long axis of the row [31, 52]. Ma et al studied the trunk SN orientations in Chinese cavefish Sinocyclocheilus for the first time [32]. On the lateral line scales, 61.7% of SNs in S. macrophthalmus were aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fish. In addition, 89.2% of SNs on the other trunk scales in S. macrophthalmus were orientated rostrocaudally., On the lateral line scales in S. tianlinensis, 89.5% of SNs were orientated rostrocaudally, and only 5.2% of SNs were orientated dorsoventrally. Hence, it can be concluded that the majority of trunk SNs exhibit either rostrocaudal or dorsoventral orientations (table 1). On the lateral line scales, both the rostrocaudally and dorsoventrally orientated SNs are present. However, SNs on the lateral line scales are arranged in a row along the dorsoventral direction, which is orthogonal to the trunk lateral line canal. This arrangement of SNs likely allows fish to perceive the flow field precisely and provides a pattern for mounting flow sensors onto autonomous underwater vehicles., Table 1. Most frequent orientations of trunk SNs in different fish species, including those on the lateral line scales (LLS) and other trunk scales (OTS). '↔' denotes the most frequent rostrocaudal orientations of trunk SNs; '', represents the most frequent dorsoventral orientations of trunk SNs; and '↔', indicates the most frequent alternate rostrocaudal and dorsoventral orientation of trunk SNs., CNs are located in the bottom part of lateral line canals at approximately equal distances from the adjacent canal pores, owing to the process of canal morphogenesis (figure 3) [53, 54]. This placement of CNs allows them to be deflected by the water flows generated by the pressure differences between the adjacent canal pores. The structure of CNs is similar to that of SNs. However, the following differences exist between them: (1) the size of CNs is larger than the size of SNs [48, 55]; (2) CNs have more hair cells than SNs [55]; and (3) the axis of the best physiological sensitivity of CNs is always parallel to the canal axis [56], whereas the best physiological sensitivity directions of SNs can vary [30, 31]. CNs respond best to the higher frequency domain functioning as a high-pass filter, compared to the SNs responding best to the lower end frequency domain [25, 57]. The high-pass filter property of CNs ensures that fish detect weak high-frequency signals even in the presence of high-amplitude, low-frequency noises by improving the signal-to-noise ratio., Figure 3. Canal lateral line system of fish. (a) A fluorescence image of the trunk lateral line system of S. microphthalmus. (b) An SEM photograph containing trunk canal pores of S. microphthalmus [35]. Abbreviations: CON, constriction; CN, canal neuromast; CP, canal pore., Download figure:, The sensitivity of the CN system is influenced by the lateral line canal morphology. Overall, the diameter of canals in the fish head ranges widely from 0.1 to 2–3 mm. The largest canals with diameters of up to 7 mm are found in a small bathypelagic fish Poromitra (Melamphaeidae) [58]. In some fish varieties, the lateral line canal becomes narrow near CNs (figure 3(a)). Montgomery et al reported that Antarctic notothenioid fish Dissostichus mawsoni had a constriction structure near CN using lateral line canal casts [59]. Jiang et al [35] and Ma et al [32] found a constriction structure near CN in Chinese cavefish Sinocyclocheilus macrophthalmus, S. microphthalmus, and S. tianlinensis through fluorescence observations., The cupula of a single neuromast is the biomechanical interface between the neuromast and the environment, which is essential for its proper functioning [60]. Previous studies demonstrated that the SN sensitivity was affected by its cupula morphology [42, 43, 61]. A mathematical model for SN micromechanical processes aimed at determining the functional implications of its morphological differences was originally proposed in a form that required numerical solutions [62]. The latter was recently modified [63] and finally presented in a completely analytical form by Yoshizawa et al in 2014 [43]. The mechanical sensitivity of SNs can be defined as S(f ), the ratio of the hair bundle deflection to the stimulus velocity [43]:, where f  is the stimulus frequency, and i is the complex operator. Kcomp, is the compliance parameter that can be calculated as, where ρ is the density of water and the cupula (ρ  =  1000 kg m−3), n is the number of hair cells, and k is the spring stiffness of the hair bundle (k  =  1 mN m−1)., Klow and Khigh are the low-frequency and high-frequency parameters, respectively. They can be computed as, , where h is the height of the cupula, u is the dynamic viscosity of water (µ  =  8.9  ×  10−4 Pas), w is the cupula width, and E is the Young's modulus of the cupular material (E  =  80 Pa) [42]., The number of hair cells in an individual SN is set to n  =  30. The cupula width is w  =  30 µm. The cupula height h can be 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, or 180 µm. Thus, the aspect ratio of a cupula is α  =  h/w. The mechanical sensitivities of SNs at various aspect ratios can be calculated using equations (1)–(4). The obtained results indicate that the larger aspect ratio of the cupula corresponds to a higher mechanical sensitivity of SNs, as shown in figure 4., Figure 4. Mechanical sensitivities of the SN computed at different cupula aspect ratios using equations (1)–(4)., Download figure:, The SN sensitivity is also affected by the number of hair cells within it [42, 43, 61]. The greater number of sensory hair cells increases the neurobiological sensitivity [42]. The fundamental lower displacement detection threshold, σmin, is related to the stochastic nature of the hair cell's transduction channel gating [25, 64]. Its value can be calculated as follows:, where kT is the thermal energy, Z is the molecular gating force, and N is the total number of transducer channels involved. This gating-spring noise scales down proportionally to the inverse of the square root of the total number of channels. The greater number of hair cells in a neuromast indicates a larger number of transducer channels. Thus, increasing the number of hair cells can reduce the noise and improve the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio., The lateral line canals not only protect CNs from damage, but also serve as mechanical filters that reduce the low-frequency noise [55, 58]. The CN sensitivity is strongly affected by the lateral line canal morphology., Denton and Gray proposed a mathematic model for the lateral line canal mechanics [28, 56]. They measured and modeled the fluid motions inside the actual lateral line canals and canal-like structures (such as capillary tubes) as functions of the frequency of sinusoidal water motions outside the canal. The lateral line canal was represented by a canal consisting of a circular section with diameter d1, which contained a narrower circular section with diameter d2 (their corresponding lengths were equal to l1 and l2, respectively). If Xin/Xout designates the ratio between the relative amplitudes of displacements in the narrower part of the canal and in the liquid adjacent to the canal, it can be found that, Here, ω  =  2πf, j  is the complex operator, Iout and Iin are the inertances outside and inside the canal, respectively, which are calculated as follows:, , Rin is the frictional (viscous) resistance under the steady (Hagen-Poiseuille) flow conditions, which can be computed as, where ρ is the density of the surrounding fluid (ρ  =  1000 kg m−3), and η is the dynamic viscosity (η  =  0.001 Pas)., The mechanical properties of the lateral line canals (in the simplified case, d1  =  d2) with various diameters can be determined using equations (6)–(9). The decrease in the canal diameter leads to an upward shift in the cut-off frequency. These results also illustrate that the canal with a larger diameter exhibits better sensitivity than that of the canal with a small diameter (figure 5). As indicated by the data obtained in previous studies [65, 66], the wider canal allows fish to be more sensitive to hydrodynamic stimuli, especially in the environments with low light or high level of hydrodynamic noise. As shown in figure 5, the constriction of the lateral line canal can result in (1) further attenuation of the response at low frequencies; (2) an upward shift in the cut-off frequency; and (3) higher sensitivity at higher frequencies [25]. Meanwhile, decreasing the lateral line canal diameter in the vicinity of the neuromast can increase the flow velocity in the narrow part of the canal relative to that in the wide part [35, 67]., Figure 5. Mechanical properties of the lateral line canals with a length of 5 mm and various diameters (0.2, 0.4, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mm). The solid line without symbols represents the constricted canal consisting of a wider canal with a length of 3 mm and diameter d1  =  0.4 mm and a narrower canal with a length of 2 mm and diameter d2  =  0.24 mm determined using equations (6)–(9)., Download figure:, As CNs are deflected by the water flows generated by the pressure differences between the adjacent canal pores, their sensitivity can be affected by the canal pore morphology. According to the results of previous studies, the lateral line canal system is most sensitive when the canal pore dimension is equal to the canal diameter [67]. Klein et al reported that the canal with a pore of large diameter demonstrated enhanced sensitivity and high spatial resolution; that was, a signal that acted on a distinct pore would propagate only over a short distance inside the lateral line canal [66]., Dipole field plays an important role in our understanding how the spatial patterns of activity observed along a linear array of sensors may contain information about flow sources, such as their locations and distances [68, 69]. A vibrating sphere (dipole source) is frequently used as a lateral line stimulus in experimental studies. In these experiments, a sphere at position (0, D) vibrates parallel or perpendicularly to the x-axis in the neuromasts plane according to the function u(t)  =  2πwsa3sin(wt). Here, a is the sphere diameter (a  =  10 mm), s is the displacement amplitude (s  =  0.05 mm), and w is the angular frequency (w  =  2πf, f   =  50 Hz)., When the sphere vibrates parallel to the x-axis, the resulting water velocity vx in the x-direction can be calculated as follows [70]:, As shown in figure 6(b), the amplitude of this flow field has two zeros, and the distance between these two zeros is {{\\Delta }_{\\parallel }}{\\rm =}\\sqrt{2}D., Figure 6. Dipole source location on a 2D plane. (a) In the 2D model, neuromasts are arranged in a linear array on the x-axis. The vibrating sphere is located at position (0, D). It vibrates parallel (the red double arrow) or perpendicularly (the blue double arrow) to the x-axis, generating a dipolar velocity field. (b) Amplitude of the velocity vx near the skin of the fish that depends on the x-position. The stimulus is a sphere located at the distance D  =  10 mm from the skin surface, which oscillates either parallel (the red line) or perpendicularly (the blue line) to the line of neuromasts., Download figure:, When the sphere vibrates perpendicularly to the x-axis, the resulting water velocity vx in the x-direction can be calculated as follows [70]:, As shown in figure 6(b), the amplitude of this flow field along the lateral line has two maxima separated by a zero. The distance between the maxima equals the distance D between the lateral line and the vibrating sphere {{\\Delta }_{\\bot }}=D., Fish can use their lateral line not only to detect a source in the horizontal plane, but also to determine its elevation [71]. Anatomical data show that both SNs and CNs are orthogonal to each other (see the details in section 2.1.1.3). In the 3D space, the sphere located at (Dx, Dy , Dz) vibrates perpendicularly to the x-axis and parallel to the y -axis in the plane z  =  Dz according to u(t)  =  2πwsa3sin(wt) (figure 7(a)). Here, a is the sphere diameter (a  =  10 mm), s is the displacement amplitude (s  =  0.05 mm), and w is the angular frequency (w  =  2πf, f   =  50 Hz)., Figure 7. Dipole source location in the 3D space. (a) In the 3D model, neuromasts are arranged in linear arrays on the x- and y -axes. The vibrating sphere is located at (Dx, Dy , Dz). It vibrates parallel (the black double arrow) to the y -axis generating a dipolar velocity field. Panels (b) and (c) show the velocity amplitudes vx and vx near the fish skin as functions of the x- and y -positions, respectively. The stimulus is an oscillating sphere at (Dx, Dy , Dz)  =  (50, 35, 30). The location of the vibrating sphere can be determined from the velocity distribution., Download figure:, The resulting water velocity vx can be calculated as follows [70]:, Thus, at y   =  0 and z  =  0, it is possible to obtain the distribution of velocity vx along the x-axis. The amplitude of this flow field has one zero, as shown in figure 7(b) (here, x  =  Dx)., The resulting water velocity vy  can be calculated as follows [70]:, Next, by setting x  =  0 and z  =  0, it is possible to obtain the distribution of velocity vy  along the y -axis. The amplitude of this flow field has one maximum with the y -value equal to Dy , as shown in figure 7(c). The amplitude of this flow field has two zeros with a distance between them equal to {{\\Delta }_{3{\\rm D}}}=\\sqrt{2(D_{z}^{2}+D_{x}^{2})}. Finally, the value of Dz can be calculated. As a result, the location (Dx, Dy , Dz) of the vibrating sphere can be determined from the information received by the neuromasts., Rheotaxis is a behavioral orientation in water currents [72]. Previous studies revealed that the lateral line system of fish contributed to their rheotactic behavior. In 1997, Profs. Montgomery and Baker directly demonstrated that rheotaxis could be mediated by the lateral line (one specific receptor class of this system) [19]. In three different fish species, both the pharmacological block of the entire lateral line system and SNs substantially increased the velocity threshold for rheotaxis. However, the ablation of CNs had no effect on the velocity threshold for rheotactic behavior, as shown in figure 8(a). These results demonstrated that SNs made an important contribution to the rheotactic behavior in fish. In 1999, Profs. Baker and Montgomery reported that the effect of pairing an odor stimulant with water current decreased the rheotactic threshold [17]. Their study not only demonstrated that the superficial lateral line system controlled rheotaxis at low current velocities, but also established a link between the mechanosensory lateral line and olfactory systems in the olfactory search behavior of cavefish., Figure 8. (a) Rheotactic responses of the blind Mexican cavefish Astyanax fasciatus under various experimental conditions. The horizontal solid and dotted lines indicate mean  ±  95% confidence intervals of the orientation response in the absence of current. Filled squares: normal fish; open squares: after the chemical ablation of CNs with gentamicin; filled circles: after the chemical ablation of neuromasts via cobalt treatment; open circles: after the physical ablation of SNs (reproduced from [19] with permission of Springer Nature). (b) Graphical representation of various bout types during rheotaxis (reproduced from [20] with permission of Springer Nature)., Download figure:, Suli et al built a system, in which the orientation against a constant water flow (positive rheotaxis) could be quantitatively assessed [21]. They found that zebrafish larvae performed positive rheotaxis and that larvae utilized both the visual and lateral line inputs for this purpose (similar to adult fish). The disruption or damage of hair cells in the absence of vision negatively affected the rheotactic performance that further recovered upon hair cell repair or regeneration., Oteiza et al reported that, in the absence of visual information, larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) performed rheotaxis using flow velocity gradients as the navigational cues [20]. They proposed a novel algorithm based on the local velocity gradients utilized by fish to avoid being dragged by flowing water. As any solid body drifting in a fluid with velocity gradients, larval zebrafish experiences a rotational flow field (or shear) around its perimeter. This rotational flow field was directly related to the local curl of the water volume (\\nabla  ×  V) according to Stokes' theorem, which stated that the integrated curl over the area (a) occupied by the fish body (S) could be measured by computing a line integral around the animal perimeter:, Thus, fish can estimate the local curl at its current position in water by calculating the line integral of the relative water flow around the circumference of its body. As larval zebrafish swims within discrete periods of motor activity (swim bouts) separated by longer inactive inter-bout periods, each swim bout necessarily elicits a change in the gradient experienced by the fish that defines the conditions, at which the subsequent bout will occur. During rheotaxis, swim bouts can be grouped into the bouts that occur after gradient increases (figure 8(b), red) and those that occur after gradient decreases (figure 8(b), blue). The former corresponds to a situation, in which the fish swims towards the area with a high water flow gradient. These results describe a simple rheotactic algorithm that allows larval zebrafish swimming straight after experiencing a decrease in the flow gradient. On the contrary, after experiencing an increase in the flow gradient, it performs a sharp turn in the direction of the flow field rotation., Ultrasensitive and highly accurate flow-sensing abilities of the fish lateral line system have inspired researchers to develop ALL systems. Commercial pressure sensors have been widely used in ALL systems for wake vortex detection. However, such sensors suffer from the low pressure resolution (1 Pa), while the lateral line receptors of fish can detect a pressure gradient as low as 0.001 Pa mm−1 and flow velocities smaller than 10−5 m s−1 [73]. Therefore, ALL sensors with high sensitivity and flexibility that allow emulating both SNs and CNs are in high demand. Since Liu reported the first silicon cantilever-based ALL flow sensors in 2002 [74], various electroactive sensing mechanisms have been explored for these devices, including piezoresistive, capacitive, thermal, optical, magnetic, and piezoelectric ones. By integrating smart flow-sensing structures into a microfluidic chip, various canal ALL systems have been developed, which are discussed in section 3.2. Section 3.3 describes the practical applications of ALL systems in underwater robots., SNs make an important contribution to the rheotactic and predation behaviors of fish [19]. Inspired by the cupula structures of SNs, multiple types of ALL flow sensors have been developed. In addition, MEMS-based biomimetic flow sensors have been briefly reviewed by Tao [22], Zhou [75], and Zhang [76]., Liu's group made a breakthrough in the development of biomimetic flow sensors in 2002, which allowed measuring laminar flows ranging from 0.1 to 1 m s−1 (figure 9(a)) [74]. A silicon piezoresistive cantilever served as the sensing element fabricated using a conventional bulk micromachining technique, and a vertical permalloy cilium coated with parylene was realized using a 3D assembly technique called plastic deformation magnetic assembly. In 2007, they reported another highly sensitive piezoresisitve flow sensor with a detection limit of 0.7 mm s−1 under oscillatory flow in water, in which photodefinable SU-8 epoxy was used to fabricate a high-aspect ratio cilium (figure 9(b)) [77]. In 2007 and 2009, Tsukruk from the Georgia Institute of Technology collaborated with Liu and Coombs to achieve the highest velocity sensitivity threshold of 2.5 µm s−1 with a bioinspired hydrogel capped hair sensory system fabricated by a precision drop-casting method (figure 9(c) and 9(d)) [46, 78]. Although the piezoresistive sensing element remained unchanged in these devices, the high-aspect ratio artificial cupula enhanced their flow detection performance by about two orders of magnitude and endowed the sensors with threshold sensitivities that were comparable with those of fish. With the support from the DARPA Biological Sensory and Structure Emulation (BioSenSE) program, Yang et al developed a thermal hot wire anemometry (HWA) array using a micromachining technology (figure 9(e)) [79]. The out-of-plane HWA with a prong length from 400 to 600 µm consisted of a nickel filament sandwiched between two layers of polyimide, which served as the passivation and structural support. The velocity sensitivities of the individual sensors reached a threshold of 0.2 mm s−1 with a bandwidth of 1 kHz. These devices demonstrated that the ALL could successfully perform dipole source localization and hydrodynamic wake detection. In 2010, Yang and Liu et al reported a novel ALL system by assembling piezoresistive biomimetic flow sensors on the surface of a cylindrical PVC model. They proposed an adaptive beamforming algorithm for dipole localization and demonstrated that the ALL system could accurately localize an artificial dipole source and natural tail-flicking crayfish under various conditions [81]., Figure 9. Various flow sensors inspired by the SNs in fish.

In 2014, they presented an artificial SN micro-sensor array containing a liquid crystal polymer (LCP) membrane, a gold strain gauge, and a Si60 cilium (figure 9(f)) [82]. In spite of the low gauge factor of gold (KAu  =  2) compared with that of piezoresistive silicon (KSi  =  140), a combination of gold strain gauges on LCP exhibited higher flow sensitivity as compared with those of piezoresistive silicon membranes due to the lower Young's modulus of LCP. Si60 polymer cilia with a high aspect ratio of 6.5 were fabricated by stereolithography. These biomimetic micro-sensors demonstrated a high water sensitivity of 0.022 V (m s−1)−1 and threshold velocity detection limit of 15 mm s−1. In 2016, they manufactured a canopy-like nanofibril pyramid around a Si60 polymer cilium by electrospinning and then drop-casted hydrogel cupula on the nanofibril scaffold (figure 9(h)) [83]. In the case of water flow-sensing, the minimum flow velocity detection threshold was 18 mm s−1. In 2015, they reported a flexible biomimetic smart skin consisting of self-powered piezoelectric hair cell flow sensors and demonstrated the ability of individual sensors to detect oscillatory flow velocities as low as 8.2 µm s−1(figure 9(g)) [84]. The piezoelectric flow sensor was composed of a 3 µm thick Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 sensing membrane, on which a high-aspect-ratio Si60 polymer pillar was positioned at the center. 2D flexible arrays of 20 flow sensors were integrated on a flexible LCP substrate to demonstrate the capability of hydrodynamic object localization. As flexible, self-powered, and ultrasensitive flow sensors were in high demand, Miao's group developed biomimetic nanoelectromechanical system flow sensor in 2017 featuring a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber sensing membrane with a hydrogel-infused vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) bundle that mechanically interacted with the flow (figure 9(i)) [85]. The sensor was capable of detecting low flows in both air and water with a velocity detection threshold of 5 mm s−1. The low flow sensitivity was likely due to the limited piezoelectricity of transversely aligned PVDF sensing elements. They also reported a new class of miniature all-polymer flow sensors that closely mimicked the intricate morphology of the mechanosensory ciliary bundles in biological hair cells. The artificial ciliary bundle was composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro-pillars with graded heights and PVDF piezoelectric nanofiber tip links. The sensors achieved a threshold detection limit of 8 µm s−1 (figure 9(j)) [86]. The above-mentioned biomimetic lateral line flow sensors were also reviewed in detail by Bora and Miao et al in 2018 [23]., In addition to the piezoelectric, piezoresistive, and thermal flow sensors, biomimetic flow sensors based on the optical and other sensing mechanisms were also demonstrated. Wolf and van Netten et al reported a novel all-optical 2D flow velocity sensor inspired by the fish lateral line neuromast, which consisted of optical fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) supporting a fluid force recipient sphere (figure 9(k)) [87]. This sensor exhibited a low frequency threshold detection limit of 5 mm s−1 (5 µm s−1 at resonance) with a typical linear dynamic range of 38 dB. As four FBGs were integrated to the fiber supporting cilium, the sensor could determine a flow direction at an accuracy of a few degrees. However, the length of the biomimetic cilium was 64.8 mm, which was approximately 100 times larger than that of the cupula of biological SNs. In 2012, Qualtieri et al designed and built a biomimetic waterproof Si/SiN multilayered cantilever whose internal stress gradient bent the beam out of the plane enabling flow velocity detection in water (figure 9(l)) [88]. Its sensing element consisted of a piezoresistive Nichrome 80/20 alloy layer deposited along the cantilever beam. The proposed sensor was characterized by a dynamic range between 5 and 30 cm s−1 in water. In 2011, Abdulsadda and Tan presented prototypes of polymer-metal composite (IPMC) based ALL sensors, which were manually cut from the larger IPMC sheet fabricated by a planar process. The IPMC flow sensor array exhibited a threshold detection limit of less than 1 mm s−1 and could localize dipole sources located at distances of 4–5 body lengths (figure 9(m)) [89]. In 2012, they fabricated another biomimetic flow sensor array by micromachining, in which micro polymer-metal composite IPMC beams were attached perpendicularly to the substrate to effectively interact with the flow (figure 9(m)) [90]. Table 2 summarizes the parameters of various ALL flow sensors, including their transduction mechanisms, dimensions, and threshold detection limits., Table 2. Parameters of the artificial SN sensors based on different operation principles., l: length; w: width; t: thickness; h: height; d: diameter., The diaphragm-based pressure sensors fabricated by silicon micromachining can be integrated into ALL systems for the detection of surface pressures. In 2007, Fernandez and Triantafyllu from MIT proposed a lateral line inspired pressure senor array consisting of hundreds of MEMS pressure sensors with diameters near 1 mm spaced a few millimeters apart and fabricated on etched silicon and Pyrex wafers (figure 10(a)). The sensing element was a strain gauge mounted on a silicon diaphragm, and the pressure resolution of the sensors was approximately 1 Pa [91]. In 2012, Yaul et al reported a flexible sensor array, which was composed of a PDMS canal with a strain-concentrating diaphragm and four resistive strain gauges fabricated from conductive carbon black-PDMS composites (figure 10(b)) [92]. The sensors achieved a pressure resolution of 1.5 Pa using a 16-bit analog/digital converter. Despite their ability to transduce underwater pressure variations produced by moving objects and surface waves, the conductive polymer sensors exhibited lower sensitivity as compared with that of silicon piezoresistive sensors. In 2016, Dusek and Triantafyllou et al developed a waterproof conformal pressure sensor array containing carbon black-doped silicone closed-cell (CBPDMS) foam (figure 10(c)). Although the CBPDMS foam sensor arrays exhibited significant advantages over the existing commercial sensors for distributed flow reconstruction and control, their threshold detection limit was as high as 5 Pa [93]. The arrays of these pressure sensors were practically used for underwater detection; however, their canal-based sensing mechanisms were not elucidated., Figure 10. Various pressure sensors inspired by the CNs of fish.

(f) A schematic showing the arrangement of bio-inspired artificial canal neuromast sensors (reproduced from [82] with permission of IOP Publishing Ltd). (g) A schematic showing the structural details of the fully flexible ALL canal system proposed by Jiang et al in 2017 [96]., Download figure:, In contrast to the conventional diaphragm-based pressure sensors, the ALL pressure sensors exhibit a canal structure with aligned pores on the canal surface and flow-sensing elements inside the canal. Therefore, they are able to detect pressure gradients along the surface instead of the absolute pressure. The pressure difference between the canal pores drives the canal fluid, which is opposed by the friction generated due to the canal walls. At the low frequency range, the frictional forces dominate the response and thus result in lower activation of the CN sensor [84]. Morever, the displacement of water particles outside the canal is larger than that inside the canal in low frequency domain, resulting in the high-pass filter nature. Most transduction mechanisms used in flow velocity sensors are applicable to ALL pressure sensors. In 2011, Liu and Bleckmann et al developed a canal ALL for hydrodynamic detection using previously reported piezoresistive biomimetic SN sensors and PDMS canals, and its noise-rejection capability was demonstrated (figure 10(d)) [94]. In 2015, Herzog et al proposed a new flow sensor mimicking the canal neuromast of the fish lateral line by placing light-guided PDMS lamella into a canal (figure 10(e)) [67]. The assembled sensor consisted of a Si-chip with two lamellae, light-emitting diodes, segmented photodiodes, housing, and electronics for amplification and analysis. The deflection of the lamella induced by pressure gradients changes the light intensity measured on each receptive segment of the photodiode and produces a directional response of the sensor. These sensors were able to detect a fluid flow velocity of 185 µm s−1 inside the canal. In addition, the artificial CNs could detect flow fluctuations, when the sensor pores were sealed by PDMS membranes [95]., In 2014, Kottapalli and Miao et al presented a MEMS CN sensor by integrating LCP MEMS sensing membranes, high-aspect ratio Si60 pillars, and a PDMS canal as shown in figure 10(f) [82]. The experimental results demonstrated that the canal structure completely filtered away the direct current (DC) flow at all flow velocities ranging from 0 to 275 mm s−1. In 2015, they reported another artificial MEMS CN sensor, which consisted of three major components: a piezoelectric MEMS sensing membrane, a high-aspect ratio hair cell, and a biomimetic canal. It was found that the artificial MEMS CN sensor could reject the noises generated by the DC and low frequency alternating current (AC) flows. In 2017, Jiang et al developed a canal ALL system by integrating cantilevered flow-sensing elements in a PDMS canal (figure 10(g)) [96], which demonstrated high-pass filtering capabilities to attenuate low-frequency stimuli and a pressure gradient detection limit of approximately 11 Pa m−1 at resonance., Various canal lateral line-based pressure sensors have been developed, and some of these devices utilized a constriction structure in the lateral line canal to locally enhance the flow velocity and thereby improve the sensitivity of the sensor [67]. Ma et al proposed a flexible canal ALL system with constriction in canal nearby CN sensor [97]. The flexible sensing elements were fabricated from poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) employing reactive ion etching (RIE) process [98]. The experimental results suggested that the ALL with constriction canal exhibited higher sensitivity as compared with that of the ALL with a normal straight canal. However, their pressure detection limits or pressure gradients were rarely reported in the corresponding studies. In addition, most biomimetic canals were manufactured from PDMS, which led to many challenges in their practical applications due to its low elastic modulus., Inspired by the rheotactic and schooling behaviors of fish, roboticists have been working on the development of underwater technologies capable of recognizing and characterizing Karman vortex streets through flow sensing, which can increase the propulsion efficiency and stability of an underwater robot under turbulent conditions., In the framework of the Fish Locomotion and. Sensing (FILOSE) project, Venturelli and Akanyeti constructed a sensor platform in 2012, which accommodated two laterally distributed pressure arrays to mimic the trunk canal lateral line system (figure 11(a)) [99]. They reported that the distributed pressure sensors had the capability to discriminate Kármán vortex streets in uniform flows and determine the orientation and position of the platform with respect to the incoming flow and central axis of the Karman vortex street. In 2013, Akanyeti et al developed a fish-shaped model containing nine pressure sensors around its head (figure 11(b)). By moving it forward and backward harmonically, they analyzed the effect of self-motion on the surface pressure of the model. It was found that the pressure signals were more sensitive to the acceleration of the craft than to low swimming velocities (<0.2 body length s−1). The distributed pressure sensors could both detect the external hydrodynamic events occurring around the model and monitor the self-motion of the craft [100]. In 2014, using the same fish-shaped model, Chambers and Akanyeti et al investigated the Karman vortex streets formed behind a cylinder at different flow velocities. They concluded that the pressure difference detected by the front and side sensors in the frontal plane provided a useful measure of the transition from the steady to an unsteady flow, and that the vortex shedding frequency and its magnitude could be used to differentiate the source size and the flow speed [101]. In 2018, Yanagitsuru et al inserted commercial pressure sensors into physical fish head models with various widths and placed them in steady and vortical flows [102], as shown in figure 11(c). They found that all model heads exhibited the highest SNR ratios in the vortices with intermediate flow speeds; however, at each head width, the SNR level was passively optimized for differently sized vortices, which might have implications for refuge and prey seeking. These results have provided insight into the sensory ecology of fishes and can be potentially used for designing autonomous underwater vehicles., Figure 11. Robotic fish equipped with commercial pressure sensors inspired by the fish lateral line system.

(g) A prototype of the ALL system consisting of nine underwater commercial pressure sensors (reproduced from [109] with permission of Springer)., Download figure:, Inspired by the fish lateral line system, Xie et al designed a robotic boxfish integrated with commercial pressure sensors that were distributed symmetrically along each side of the fish as shown in figure 11(d). In 2014, they demonstrated that the swimming speed of robotic fish could be determined from pressure information, which made the fish aware of its motion status [103]. In 2018, they reported the local sensing between two adjacent robotic fish [104]. By measuring hydrodynamic pressure variations using the ALL system and extracting meaningful information from the pressure sensor readings, the oscillating frequency/amplitude/offset of the adjacent robotic fish, relative vertical distance, and relative yaw/pitch/roll angle between the robotic fish and its neighbor were sensed efficiently., In 2016, Strokina et al proposed a bioinspired sensor probe consisting of an ALL sensor array for the in situ measurements of complex natural flow patterns (e.g. for the evaluation of hydraulic structures in a river) and introduced the bulk flow velocity and flow angle as the chosen pattern primitives [105]. In 2018, Tuhtan et al built a fish-shaped lateral line probe equipped with 11 high-speed time-synchronized pressure transducers to capture and classify flows in fish passage structures (figure 11(e)) [106]. The hydrodynamic signatures based on the collection of the probability distributions of pressure fluctuations can be used to automatically classify distinct flow regions within the pools of three different vertical slot fishways. Field data obtained by operational fishway measurements were sampled and classified using an ALL for the first time, providing a completely new source of bioinspired flow information., In 2015, Asadnia et al established the applicability of MEMS flow sensors for sensing and control applications of an underwater robotic stingray. A predictive control system has been applied by relying on the developed MEMS sensors that could successfully guide the robotic stingray to track a desired trajectory [107]. In 2018, Liu et al developed an ALL system composed of 25 micro-pressure sensors by imitating the mechanism of fish CNs, as shown in figure 11(f) [108]. The optimal sensor distribution model and underwater environment perception algorithm were obtained through hydrodynamic simulations. The proposed ALL system allowed flow velocity estimation and attitude perception in a turbulent flow as well as recognition of obstacle shapes using a neural network algorithm. In 2018, Zheng et al proposed an ALL system consisting of nine underwater commercial pressure sensors that formed a cross-shaped sensor array (figure 11(g)) [109]. The obtained experimental results indicated that the cross-shaped ALL system was able to localize the target dipole source located two body lengths away. The optimal perceptual distance between this system and the sensing array was below 13 cm. Moreover, decreasing the data sampling interval and increasing the number of utilized sensors can significantly improve the positioning accuracy., In 2013, Lagor et al presented an ALL system composed of pressure sensors for a bioinspired robotic fish capable of the autonomous flow-speed estimation and rheotaxis [110]. They achieved the model-based rheotaxis control of a fish robot based on the results of pressure difference measurements without first training an empirical or fluid-mechanical model to match the flow field conditions. In 2015, Zhang et al proposed a novel flexible fish robot equipped with distributed pressure sensors for flow sensing [111]. They presented a systematic approach to distributed flow sensing for the closed-loop speed control of a flexible fish robot by regulating the flapping amplitude. In 2015, DeVries et al developed a robotic prototype outfitted with a multi-modal ALL system composed of ionic polymer metal composite (a velocity sensor) and commercial pressure sensors [112]. They experimentally demonstrated the distributed flow-sensing and closed-loop control strategies. The proposed closed-loop control algorithms incorporating estimated flow field properties allowed an underwater vehicle to emulate the rheotaxis and station holding behaviors. In 2018, using the potential flow theory, recursive Bayesian filtering, and trajectory-tracking feedback control, Free and Paley demonstrated a bioinspired array of pressure sensors on a Joukowski foil to estimate and control flow-relative position in a Karman vortex street [113]. The closed-loop control experiments conducted in a flow tank showed that the ALL in conjunction with the potential flow model and Bayesian estimator allowed the robot to perform fish-like slaloming behavior in a Karman vortex street., Several other robotic models integrated with commercial pressure sensors for hydrodynamic sensing were reported in the literature [114–116]. The majority of demonstrations used commercial pressure sensors with a detection limit of approximately 1 Pa, which was a bottleneck for practical applications. It should be noted that few robotic fish integrated with artificial SN sensors have been developed, as no commercially available sensors for external flow detection currently exist., The lateral line of fish provided strong inspiration for the design of ALL sensors. As a result, various SN and CN sensors with improved sensitivity and flexibility were constructed, and several of them were placed onto underwater robots for evaluation experiments. However, multiple technological challenges must be resolved for the practical implementation of the ALL system, which include its sensitivity, noise, durability, stability, and sensor fusion methodology., The lateral line is an intrinsically sensory organ for the near-field flow perception with a detection range of 3–5 body lengths, as the pressure fluctuations surrounding the fish are relatively small. The best sensitivities of CNs and SNs are tuned to their specific frequencies for predation, mating, and schooling. In the case of ALL sensors, the most sensitive artificial SN sensor exhibits a flow detection threshold of approximately 2.5 µm s−1, and the minimum detectable pressure gradient of the ALL canal system is approximately 11 Pa m−1 [46, 96]. To increase the sensitivity of ALL sensors, it is important to take the resonance frequency of the sensing element into account. However, this principle cannot be applied to the diaphragm-based pressure sensors. There are limited CN sensors developed, compared with the SN sensors. A large scope of work is required to be conducted ahead in the CN sensor development. CN-inspired sensors would improve the robustness of artificial MEMS sensors, as the microfluidic canal encapsulation of the hair cells brings a mechanical protection to the hair cells from accidental damage [23]. Moreover, CN sensors employ constrictions at the location of the sensing elements can locally enhance the flow velocity and thereby improve their sensitivity [67, 97]., Hydrodynamic noise is ubiquitous in an aquatic environment, even in apparently quiet ponds and lakes. The increase in the water speed promotes the high-frequency water oscillation. Fish are able to filter out meaningful signals and reduce the level of hydrodynamic noise via mechanical filtering mechanisms, which were theoretically analyzed by van Netten et al [41]. In addition to the mechanical filtering based on the cupula resonance and canal effect, it is most likely that the output signals of the hair cells in the same neuromast are averaged for noise reduction. However, it is technically problematic to use this averaging scheme for each artificial neuromast sensor, which consists of one or two sensing elements. In addition, both piezoresistive and piezoelectric sensors suffer from the strong electromagnetic interference caused by impedance. Hence, the preamplifier must be integrated close to the sensing element., ALL sensors based on flexible electronics can be mounted on the curved surface of underwater robots. Piezoelectric polymers, polymer-based conductive nanocomposites, and IPMC have been widely used as the sensing materials for ALL sensors. PVDF and its copolymers exhibit extremely high piezoelectric voltage constants and, therefore, are suitable for the detection of underwater flow and vibration. Various conductive nanocomposites based on graphene, carbon black, and CNT fillers with very high gauge factors comparable to that of silicon piezoresistors have been developed. However, the stability of the polymer-based strain sensors is outweighed by the serious technological challenges caused by the inherent creeping deformation of polymers. Few reports were focused on the stability of flexible ALL sensors that suffered from temperature fluctuations and pressure variations. In addition, most artificial CN sensors utilize PDMS and other elastomers to fabricate ALL canals due to the well-established PDMS fabrication process. Owing to the low elastic modulus of PDMS, the deformation of ALL canals leads to high sensitivity variations of the artificial CN sensors., Waterproofing is a crucial issue for underwater sensors, as they have to be exposed to an aqueous environment for a long time. Poor waterproof properties of the sensing elements may cause a short circuit and change their mechanical behavior, resulting in a sensor fault. One of the most popular approaches to solving this problem is to coat a parylene C layer on the sensor surface by chemical vapor deposition [88, 117]; in this case, the thickness of the parylene coating should be larger than 8 µm [118]. The adhesion strength between the parylene coating and the sensor surface can be improved by treating the latter with a dilute isopropyl alcohol-water solution of organic silane gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (A-174) [119] or plasma [120]. Another approach is to apply an Al2O3 and parylene bilayer coating, which has been widely used for the capsulation of implantable neural arrays to achieve long-term stability [121, 122]. In addition, anti-fouling coating should be performed to prevent the attachment of microorganisms and dust particles on the sensor surface., Many ALL systems are composed of sensors arranged in a regular linear pattern, which significantly differ from the biological fish lateral line system. As described in section 2.1, regardless of the trunk SN distribution, some SNs (functioning as velocity sensors) are always closely associated with the lateral line canals, which might give an inspiration for the spatial arrangement of flow sensors. In addition, the intervals between the sensors should be determined by considering the sensor spacing, sensitivity, and system topology distribution. For example, the optimization of the sensor distribution can reduce the number of sensors and economic costs., Fish use the lateral line system based on both CNs and SNs for flow perception. The sensing fusion of the pressure and flow receptors plays an important role in the lateral line system as the polarized SNs and CNs are well arranged on the lateral line scales. Fish can first estimate the direction of a vibrating source using polarized SNs, after which it determines the distance to the vibrating source precisely through the sensing fusion of SNs and CNs. The latter can likely improve the stability and accuracy of the lateral line system, as one sensing modality can calibrate another modality. The observability of the flow properties that are only weakly detectable by one modality is also enhanced by the fusion of SNs and CNs. However, there are few studies in which ALL systems with the sensing fusion mechanism are currently being developed [119]. Hence, it is very promising to develop an ALL system containing both artificial CNs and SNs to mimic the sensing fusion mechanism of the fish lateral line system., The lateral line system of fish helps them to obtain hydrodynamic information effectively and plays an important role in their communication, schooling, and predation behaviors. In this paper, we reviewed the recent findings in the morphology, function, and sensing algorithms of the lateral line system. Owing to the recent advances in the fields of smart materials, flexible electronics, and microfabrication technology, ALL sensors based on various sensing modalities have been developed. Although roboticists utilized the ALL to demonstrate the hydrodynamic sensing capability of underwater robots, the sensitivity, stability, and durability of the current ALL systems must be improved for their practical applications in the real environments. More advanced sensing fusion algorithms and integration techniques are required for the next generation of ALL sensors., This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51575027).","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/041001"},{"title":"Random sequential addition simulations of animal aggregations provide null models of group structure","authors":"Daniel Olsen, David W Murphy","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"8 April 2019","abstract":"Apparent structure in animal aggregations such as fish and Antarctic krill schools may result from the tight packing of these elongated animals.

The bony rays embedded in the fin are modeled as nonlinear Euler–Bernoulli beams. To demonstrate the capability of this model, we numerically investigate the effect of various ray stiffness distributions on the deformation and propulsion performance of a 3D caudal fin. Our numerical results show that with specific ray stiffness distributions, certain caudal fin deformation patterns observed in real fish (e.g. the cupping deformation) can be reproduced through passive structural deformations. Among the four different stiffness distributions (uniform, cupping, W-shape and heterocercal) considered here, we find that the cupping distribution requires the least power expenditure. The uniform distribution, on the other hand, performs the best in terms of thrust generation and efficiency. The uniform stiffness distribution, per se, also leads to 'cupping' deformation patterns with relatively smaller phase differences between various rays. The present model paves the way for future work on dynamics of skeleton-reinforced membranes.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/036012"},{"title":"Musculoskeletal design, control, and application of human mimetic humanoid Kenshiro","authors":"Yuki Asano, Kei Okada, Masayuki Inaba","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"8 April 2019","abstract":"We have been developing a human mimetic musculoskeletal humanoid called Kenshiro, whose design concept is to thoroughly pursue an unprecedented anatomical fidelity to the human musculoskeletal structure.

Although robotic fish have been well studied, including algorithms to simulate group swimming, experiments that demonstrate multiple robotic fish as a stable group are yet to be achieved. One of the challenges is the lack of a robust bottom-level motion control system for robotic fish platforms. Here we seek to overcome this challenge by focusing on the design and implementation of a motion controller for robotic fish that allows multiple individuals to swim in groups. As direction control is essential in motion control, we first propose a high-accuracy controller which can control a sub-carangiform robotic fish from one arbitrary position/pose (position and direction) to another. We then develop a hydrodynamic-model-based simulation platform to expedite the process of the parameter tuning of the controller. The accuracy of the simulation platform was assessed by comparing the results from experiments on a robotic fish using speeding and turning tests. Subsequently, extensive simulations and experiments with robotic fish were used to verify the accuracy and robustness of the bottom-level motion control. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our controller by implementing group swimming using three robotic fish swimming freely in prescribed trajectories. Although the fluid environment can be complex during group swimming, our bottom-level motion control remained nominally accurate and robust. This motion control strategy lays a solid foundation for further studies of group swimming with multiple robotic fish.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046001"},{"title":"A bio-inspired electric camera for short-range object inspection in murky waters","authors":"Martin Gottwald, Hendrik Herzog, Gerhard von der Emde","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"8 April 2019","abstract":"Underwater object inspection by optical sensors is usually unreliable in turbid or dark environments.

The camera-based electric images strongly resembled those available to G. petersii. Furthermore, by extracting the fish's analytical cues from these images, close objects could be reliably analysed. Based on the level of 'image blurring' short distances of electrolocation targets, spheres of different sizes and material were estimated. Natural targets, fish or plants, were identified irrespective of their size or distance by their two individual 'electric colours' derived from electric images. Furthermore, we introduce an image cue, called the 'electric outline', which provided information resembling a target's optical contour. Our results indicate that bio-inspired electric imaging principles provide promising cues for sensor-based, short-range object inspections in murky waters. By resembling the electric imaging applied by G. petersii our device can also be used for 'reverse biomimetics', revealing imaging cues that so far have not been considered for weakly electric fish.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/035002"},{"title":"Learning bioinspired joint geometry from motion capture data of bat flight","authors":"Matthew Bender, Jia Guo, Nathan Powell, Andrew Kurdila, Rolf Müller","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"10 April 2019","abstract":"Bioinspired robotic systems are often designed by assuming that the kinematics of the biological system of interest are well approximated by an open kinematic chain subject to box constraints.

This reachable set is identified by constructing an analytical-empirical potential energy function over the experimental observations. The energy function effectively 'pushes' configurations close to the set of observations.

Achieving a better understanding of the flow field perception algorithms of the lateral line can contribute not only to the design of highly sensitive flow sensors, but also to the development of underwater smart skin with good hydrodynamic imaging properties. In this review, we discuss highly sensitive flow-sensing mechanisms for superficial and canal neuromasts and flow field perception algorithms. Artificial lateral line systems with different transduction mechanisms are then described with special emphasis on the recent innovations in the field of polymer-based artificial flow sensors. Finally, we discuss our perspective of the technological challenges faced while improving flow sensitivity, durability, and sensing fusion schemes., Owing to the existence of harsh hydrodynamic environments with cluttered and murky water, in which underwater autonomous vehicles navigate, vision-based techniques may fail to detect the surroundings. Nature has developed and optimized an incredible variety of sensors for navigation, spatial orientation, predation, and object detection that provide engineers with new ideas for improving the current technologies, developing new sensors, and miniaturizing potential sensor [1]. Many examples of the successful application of biomimetic designs include microlens inspired by brittle stars [2], a digital camera mimicking the arthropod eye [3], tactile sensors inspired by the fine texture of human fingertips [4], flexible organic artificial afferent nerves [5], ultra-sensitive flow sensors with artificial Harbor seal whiskers [6], and biomimetic hair-like flow sensors [7]., Fish and aquatic amphibians are able to perceive minute fluid motions and pressure gradients with their mechanosensory lateral line system [8, 9]. It can assist these species in performing various functions such as schooling [10, 11], prey detection [12–14], communication [15, 16], and rheotaxis [17–21]. Inspired by the astonishing flow perception ability of the lateral line organs, many researchers have developed various artificial lateral line (ALL) sensors based on different sensing mechanisms including piezoresistive, piezoelectric, and optical detection schemes [7, 22, 23]. The sensitivity and detection threshold of ALL sensors benefit from the rapid progress in the fields of flexible electronics and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)., The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive review of biomimetic lateral line sensors, which includes a description of the basic sensing mechanisms of the biological lateral line and recent advances in the area of bioinspired sensors. In the first section, we describe the fish lateral line-based flow-sensing capabilities including the function, distribution, and morphology of the lateral line; highly sensitive flow-sensing mechanisms; and flow field sensing algorithms. In the second section, we discuss the technological approaches proposed in the literature for ALL sensors and their applications in underwater robots. Finally, we share our perspective on the technological challenges encountered during the practical implementation of ALL systems., The lateral line system consists of numerous neuromasts distributed non-uniformly over the entire fish body, as shown in figure 1(a). As functional units of the lateral line system, neuromasts are small receptor organs composed of mechanosensory hair and nonsensory cells (figure 1(b)). The hair bundle in an individual hair cell consists of a single kinocilium and several shorter stereocilia with graded lengths [24] (figures 1(b) and (c)). The ciliary bundles of all hair cells in an individual neuromast project into an enlarged transparent cupula that deflects the stereocilia and starts a transduction process of excitation or inhibition via mechanically sensitive ion channels, as shown in figure 1(d). The stereocilia are connected at their tips through tip links. Their bending towards the kinocilium initiates the transport of ions across the hair cell membrane, depolarizes it, and increases the firing rate of afferent neurons generating an excitatory response [25]. The bending of stereocilia away from the kinocilium in the opposite direction prevents the transport of ions, hyperpolarizes the hair cell membrane, and decreases the firing rate of neurons generating an inhibitory response., Figure 1. Lateral line system of fish.

(c) A schematic diagram of the individual hair cell. The kinocilium supports the stereocilia and is capable of bending in response to saturating stimuli to maintain high sensitivity. The stereocilia deform in response to mechanical stimuli to change the tension on the tip-links, which affects the rate of neuron firing because of the change in the ion-valve position. Furthermore, the motor proteins connected to the tip-links also react to the tension (reproduced from [39] with permission of WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co. KGaA, Weinheim).

(e) A SN freestanding on the body surface, which is directly stimulated by the nearby flow field. (f) A CN located in the subepidermal fluid-filled lateral line canal connected to the ambient environment via canal pores., Download figure:, Based on their location, neuromasts in most teleost fish can be divided into two types: canal neuromasts (CNs) and superficial neuromasts (SNs) (figures 1(e) and (f)). As SNs are freestanding on the skin surface, the cupula interacts with external fluids directly and is sensitive to flow velocities. However, CNs are located in the subepidermal fluid-filled lateral line canals connected to the ambient environment via canal pores and thus are sensitive to the pressure gradients between two adjacent canal pores [26, 27]., The spatial distribution of neuromasts throughout the fish body determines the amplitude of the receptive field of the lateral line sensory system [28]. The distribution of CNs is limited because they are located within the lateral line canals. However, the distribution of SNs varies among different fish species as follows., In many teleost fish species, SNs are present on the head, trunk, and caudal fin and arranged in lines on the body surface [29]. On the head, SNs are dorsal and ventral as well as rostral and caudal to the eye, on the ventral mandible and in the opercular region [30, 31]. In the eyeless Chinese cavefish Sinocyclocheilus tianlinensis, SNs are distributed almost over the entire head [32]. SNs of the blind Mexican cavefish Astyanax mexicanus are also distributed almost over the entire head [33]. The proliferation of cephalic SNs in cavefish is likely a compensation for the absence of vision. On the tail, SNs are arranged in rostrocaudal rows. For instance, Schmitz et al investigated four Cyprinidae species and found that the SNs on the caudal fin in all fish species formed distinct rostrocaudal lines [31]., SNs are also distributed over the trunk body surface or closely associated with the lateral line canals. The results of previous studies show that the trunk superficial lateral line systems of fish inhabiting running water are closely associated with lateral line canals. This morphology is characteristic of Phoxinus phoxinus [31] and Cheimarrichthys fosteri [19, 34] species. In S. microphthalmus, which dwells in the karst caves of subterranean streams, the trunk SN system is closely associated with the lateral line canal [35]. The trunk SNs in S. macrophthalmus and S. tianlinensis cavefish are not randomly distributed over the body surface; however, they are closely associated with the lateral line canals [32]. The trunk SNs of the blind cavefish Astyanax mexicanus, which resides in still water, are distributed across the entire trunk [36]. Members of the North American cavefish family Amblyopsidae such as Speoplatyrhinus poulsoni prefer still water, and their trunk SNs are arranged in distinct elevated ridges that occupy nearly the entire trunk in the dorsoventral direction [37]. However, the trunk SNs of certain still water fish species including Rhodeus sericeus, Cobitis taenia, and Tinca tinca are closely associated with the lateral line canals [38]. Therefore, the trunk SN distribution is poorly correlated with the habitat. This conclusion is consistent with that of previous studies [31, 38]. Regardless of the trunk SNs distribution, some SNs are always closely associated with the lateral line canals, which may inspire a spatial arrangement of flow sensors., The cupula of a neuromast transmits the hydrodynamic forces produced by the flow of water near the body surface to deflect the hair bundles and thus generates a nervous response [41]. In previous studies, it was concluded that the cupula morphology could affect the mechanical sensitivity of SNs [42, 43]. Teyke characterized the cupula morphology of SNs in blind cavefish Astyanax hubbsi and sighted river fish Astyanax mexicanus via methylene blue vital staining [44]. He found that the cupula height varied with its neuromast location and that cephalic neuromasts had the highest cupula. He also concluded that the cephalic cupula heights in blind cavefish and sighted river fish were approximately 150 µm and 42 µm, respectively. Schmitz et al investigated the cupula morphology of SNs in goldfish (Carassius auratus) through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations [30]. The cupula bases were elongated along the long axis of the SNs, and the cupula lengths were approximately 40–45 µm. van Trump and McHenry measured the neuromast dimensions using a novel morphometric technique that recorded landmarks in three dimensions at a microscopic scale [45]. These measurements provided indirect evidence for significant variations of the cupula height. The obtained results also suggested that the natural variation in the cupular height within a species was capable of generating large differences in their mechanical filtering and dynamic ranges. Yoshizawa et al revealed the cupula morphology of SNs in blind cavefish Astyanax mexicanus using fluorescent polystyrene microspheres preferentially adhered to the cupula material [43]. The obtained results indicated that the cupula width and height of cavefish (Los Sabinos and Pachón) were significantly larger than those of surface fish., The greatest differences were observed for small fish. For instance, the median heights of the SN cupula within the eye orbits of the Los Sabinos (75 µm) and Pachón (76 µm) populations were twice as large as that of small surface fish (31 µm)., As sensory units of the neuromast, hair cells play an important role in perception. The results of previous studies indicate that the number of hair cells in a single SN can affect the SN sensitivity [42, 43]. Its magnitude can be obtained through SEM observations. Schmitz et al investigated the organization of the SN system in goldfish (Carassius auratus) in detail and determined that each SN had 14–32 hair cells that were arranged in a sensory epithelium with the axis of best sensitivity aligned perpendicularly to the long axis of the neuromast [30]. Ma et al found that the SN in sighted cavefish Sinocyclocheilus macrophthalmus possessed approximately 20 hair cells [32], as shown in figure 2(b). They also concluded that SNs in eyeless cavefish possessed more hair cells that that in sighted cavefish. Yoshizawa et al found that cavefish had more hair cells in an individual SN than surface fish using a motorized compound microscope with Nomarski illumination [43]. The surface fish consistently possessed neuromasts with fewer hair cells as compared with those of cavefish from both populations, and the number of hair cells in the neuromasts of large individuals was greater than that in the neuromasts of small individuals according to the results of most post hoc comparisons. These differences between the cavefish and surface fish are more pronounced for small fish. For the SNs located within the eye orbit, the number of hair cells in Los Sabinos (median of 38) was higher than that in Pachón (28), which in turn had more hair cells than that of surface fish (17)., Figure 2. Superficial lateral line system of fish.

(b) Hair cells of the individual SN of the Chinese cavefish Sinocyclocheilus macrophthalmus. The white double arrow indicates the best sensitivity direction. (c) Enlarged image of panel (b) showing the hair bundle in the hair cell with a kinocilium (K) and stereocilia (S) [32]., Download figure:, The hair cell polarization of SNs, i.e. the axis of best sensitivity, is defined as the gradient direction of a hair bundle (figures 2(b) and (c)). SN orientation is determined by the angle between the best sensitivity direction of SNs and the long axis of the fish body (the rostrocaudal direction). The studies related to the orientations of SNs are limited to a few fish species, such as several Cyprinidae varieties [30–32], Umbra limi [47], Oreochromis aureus [27], and Lepisosteus platyrhincus [48]., On the fish head, the orientations of SNs are diverse. Schmitz et al described the SNs orientation of goldfish (Carassius auratus) in detail [30]. On the goldfish head, most SNs are arranged in rows or groups of similar orientations with angle deviations smaller than 45°. Neighboring groups of SNs can differ with respect to their orientation. The most frequent hair cell polarization was dorsoventral in front of the eyes and on the ventral mandible and rostrocaudal below the eye and on the operculum. In Gobius niger (Gobiidae) and Lepisosteus, SNs are arranged on the head in vertical columns and horizontal rows with rostrocaudal or dorsoventral orientations [49, 50]. In the notothenioid Trematomus sp., cephalic SNs are mainly oriented dorsoventrally, whereas on the operculum, they are mainly oriented rostrocaudally [51]. The various orientations of SNs on the fish head are not surprising because the head is not flat, and its surface exists in three dimensions. In addition, the lateral line canals on the head are not linear; therefore, if the SNs located in the vicinity of the canals are oriented parallel or perpendicularly to the canals, various orientations are expected. However, the functional significance of neuromast orientation patterns on the fish head has not been examined yet., Trunk SNs are arranged into dorsoventral rows, as shown in figure 1(a). The SNs within a row possess the same orientations, which are parallel or orthogonal to the long axis of the row [31, 52]. Ma et al studied the trunk SN orientations in Chinese cavefish Sinocyclocheilus for the first time [32]. On the lateral line scales, 61.7% of SNs in S. macrophthalmus were aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fish. In addition, 89.2% of SNs on the other trunk scales in S. macrophthalmus were orientated rostrocaudally., On the lateral line scales in S. tianlinensis, 89.5% of SNs were orientated rostrocaudally, and only 5.2% of SNs were orientated dorsoventrally. Hence, it can be concluded that the majority of trunk SNs exhibit either rostrocaudal or dorsoventral orientations (table 1). On the lateral line scales, both the rostrocaudally and dorsoventrally orientated SNs are present. However, SNs on the lateral line scales are arranged in a row along the dorsoventral direction, which is orthogonal to the trunk lateral line canal. This arrangement of SNs likely allows fish to perceive the flow field precisely and provides a pattern for mounting flow sensors onto autonomous underwater vehicles., Table 1. Most frequent orientations of trunk SNs in different fish species, including those on the lateral line scales (LLS) and other trunk scales (OTS). '↔' denotes the most frequent rostrocaudal orientations of trunk SNs; '', represents the most frequent dorsoventral orientations of trunk SNs; and '↔', indicates the most frequent alternate rostrocaudal and dorsoventral orientation of trunk SNs., CNs are located in the bottom part of lateral line canals at approximately equal distances from the adjacent canal pores, owing to the process of canal morphogenesis (figure 3) [53, 54]. This placement of CNs allows them to be deflected by the water flows generated by the pressure differences between the adjacent canal pores. The structure of CNs is similar to that of SNs. However, the following differences exist between them: (1) the size of CNs is larger than the size of SNs [48, 55]; (2) CNs have more hair cells than SNs [55]; and (3) the axis of the best physiological sensitivity of CNs is always parallel to the canal axis [56], whereas the best physiological sensitivity directions of SNs can vary [30, 31]. CNs respond best to the higher frequency domain functioning as a high-pass filter, compared to the SNs responding best to the lower end frequency domain [25, 57]. The high-pass filter property of CNs ensures that fish detect weak high-frequency signals even in the presence of high-amplitude, low-frequency noises by improving the signal-to-noise ratio., Figure 3. Canal lateral line system of fish. (a) A fluorescence image of the trunk lateral line system of S. microphthalmus. (b) An SEM photograph containing trunk canal pores of S. microphthalmus [35]. Abbreviations: CON, constriction; CN, canal neuromast; CP, canal pore., Download figure:, The sensitivity of the CN system is influenced by the lateral line canal morphology. Overall, the diameter of canals in the fish head ranges widely from 0.1 to 2–3 mm. The largest canals with diameters of up to 7 mm are found in a small bathypelagic fish Poromitra (Melamphaeidae) [58]. In some fish varieties, the lateral line canal becomes narrow near CNs (figure 3(a)). Montgomery et al reported that Antarctic notothenioid fish Dissostichus mawsoni had a constriction structure near CN using lateral line canal casts [59]. Jiang et al [35] and Ma et al [32] found a constriction structure near CN in Chinese cavefish Sinocyclocheilus macrophthalmus, S. microphthalmus, and S. tianlinensis through fluorescence observations., The cupula of a single neuromast is the biomechanical interface between the neuromast and the environment, which is essential for its proper functioning [60]. Previous studies demonstrated that the SN sensitivity was affected by its cupula morphology [42, 43, 61]. A mathematical model for SN micromechanical processes aimed at determining the functional implications of its morphological differences was originally proposed in a form that required numerical solutions [62]. The latter was recently modified [63] and finally presented in a completely analytical form by Yoshizawa et al in 2014 [43]. The mechanical sensitivity of SNs can be defined as S(f ), the ratio of the hair bundle deflection to the stimulus velocity [43]:, where f  is the stimulus frequency, and i is the complex operator. Kcomp, is the compliance parameter that can be calculated as, where ρ is the density of water and the cupula (ρ  =  1000 kg m−3), n is the number of hair cells, and k is the spring stiffness of the hair bundle (k  =  1 mN m−1)., Klow and Khigh are the low-frequency and high-frequency parameters, respectively. They can be computed as, , where h is the height of the cupula, u is the dynamic viscosity of water (µ  =  8.9  ×  10−4 Pas), w is the cupula width, and E is the Young's modulus of the cupular material (E  =  80 Pa) [42]., The number of hair cells in an individual SN is set to n  =  30. The cupula width is w  =  30 µm. The cupula height h can be 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, or 180 µm. Thus, the aspect ratio of a cupula is α  =  h/w. The mechanical sensitivities of SNs at various aspect ratios can be calculated using equations (1)–(4). The obtained results indicate that the larger aspect ratio of the cupula corresponds to a higher mechanical sensitivity of SNs, as shown in figure 4., Figure 4. Mechanical sensitivities of the SN computed at different cupula aspect ratios using equations (1)–(4)., Download figure:, The SN sensitivity is also affected by the number of hair cells within it [42, 43, 61]. The greater number of sensory hair cells increases the neurobiological sensitivity [42]. The fundamental lower displacement detection threshold, σmin, is related to the stochastic nature of the hair cell's transduction channel gating [25, 64]. Its value can be calculated as follows:, where kT is the thermal energy, Z is the molecular gating force, and N is the total number of transducer channels involved. This gating-spring noise scales down proportionally to the inverse of the square root of the total number of channels. The greater number of hair cells in a neuromast indicates a larger number of transducer channels. Thus, increasing the number of hair cells can reduce the noise and improve the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio., The lateral line canals not only protect CNs from damage, but also serve as mechanical filters that reduce the low-frequency noise [55, 58]. The CN sensitivity is strongly affected by the lateral line canal morphology., Denton and Gray proposed a mathematic model for the lateral line canal mechanics [28, 56]. They measured and modeled the fluid motions inside the actual lateral line canals and canal-like structures (such as capillary tubes) as functions of the frequency of sinusoidal water motions outside the canal. The lateral line canal was represented by a canal consisting of a circular section with diameter d1, which contained a narrower circular section with diameter d2 (their corresponding lengths were equal to l1 and l2, respectively). If Xin/Xout designates the ratio between the relative amplitudes of displacements in the narrower part of the canal and in the liquid adjacent to the canal, it can be found that, Here, ω  =  2πf, j  is the complex operator, Iout and Iin are the inertances outside and inside the canal, respectively, which are calculated as follows:, , Rin is the frictional (viscous) resistance under the steady (Hagen-Poiseuille) flow conditions, which can be computed as, where ρ is the density of the surrounding fluid (ρ  =  1000 kg m−3), and η is the dynamic viscosity (η  =  0.001 Pas)., The mechanical properties of the lateral line canals (in the simplified case, d1  =  d2) with various diameters can be determined using equations (6)–(9). The decrease in the canal diameter leads to an upward shift in the cut-off frequency. These results also illustrate that the canal with a larger diameter exhibits better sensitivity than that of the canal with a small diameter (figure 5). As indicated by the data obtained in previous studies [65, 66], the wider canal allows fish to be more sensitive to hydrodynamic stimuli, especially in the environments with low light or high level of hydrodynamic noise. As shown in figure 5, the constriction of the lateral line canal can result in (1) further attenuation of the response at low frequencies; (2) an upward shift in the cut-off frequency; and (3) higher sensitivity at higher frequencies [25]. Meanwhile, decreasing the lateral line canal diameter in the vicinity of the neuromast can increase the flow velocity in the narrow part of the canal relative to that in the wide part [35, 67]., Figure 5. Mechanical properties of the lateral line canals with a length of 5 mm and various diameters (0.2, 0.4, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mm). The solid line without symbols represents the constricted canal consisting of a wider canal with a length of 3 mm and diameter d1  =  0.4 mm and a narrower canal with a length of 2 mm and diameter d2  =  0.24 mm determined using equations (6)–(9)., Download figure:, As CNs are deflected by the water flows generated by the pressure differences between the adjacent canal pores, their sensitivity can be affected by the canal pore morphology. According to the results of previous studies, the lateral line canal system is most sensitive when the canal pore dimension is equal to the canal diameter [67]. Klein et al reported that the canal with a pore of large diameter demonstrated enhanced sensitivity and high spatial resolution; that was, a signal that acted on a distinct pore would propagate only over a short distance inside the lateral line canal [66]., Dipole field plays an important role in our understanding how the spatial patterns of activity observed along a linear array of sensors may contain information about flow sources, such as their locations and distances [68, 69]. A vibrating sphere (dipole source) is frequently used as a lateral line stimulus in experimental studies. In these experiments, a sphere at position (0, D) vibrates parallel or perpendicularly to the x-axis in the neuromasts plane according to the function u(t)  =  2πwsa3sin(wt). Here, a is the sphere diameter (a  =  10 mm), s is the displacement amplitude (s  =  0.05 mm), and w is the angular frequency (w  =  2πf, f   =  50 Hz)., When the sphere vibrates parallel to the x-axis, the resulting water velocity vx in the x-direction can be calculated as follows [70]:, As shown in figure 6(b), the amplitude of this flow field has two zeros, and the distance between these two zeros is {{\\Delta }_{\\parallel }}{\\rm =}\\sqrt{2}D., Figure 6. Dipole source location on a 2D plane. (a) In the 2D model, neuromasts are arranged in a linear array on the x-axis. The vibrating sphere is located at position (0, D). It vibrates parallel (the red double arrow) or perpendicularly (the blue double arrow) to the x-axis, generating a dipolar velocity field. (b) Amplitude of the velocity vx near the skin of the fish that depends on the x-position. The stimulus is a sphere located at the distance D  =  10 mm from the skin surface, which oscillates either parallel (the red line) or perpendicularly (the blue line) to the line of neuromasts., Download figure:, When the sphere vibrates perpendicularly to the x-axis, the resulting water velocity vx in the x-direction can be calculated as follows [70]:, As shown in figure 6(b), the amplitude of this flow field along the lateral line has two maxima separated by a zero. The distance between the maxima equals the distance D between the lateral line and the vibrating sphere {{\\Delta }_{\\bot }}=D., Fish can use their lateral line not only to detect a source in the horizontal plane, but also to determine its elevation [71]. Anatomical data show that both SNs and CNs are orthogonal to each other (see the details in section 2.1.1.3). In the 3D space, the sphere located at (Dx, Dy , Dz) vibrates perpendicularly to the x-axis and parallel to the y -axis in the plane z  =  Dz according to u(t)  =  2πwsa3sin(wt) (figure 7(a)). Here, a is the sphere diameter (a  =  10 mm), s is the displacement amplitude (s  =  0.05 mm), and w is the angular frequency (w  =  2πf, f   =  50 Hz)., Figure 7. Dipole source location in the 3D space. (a) In the 3D model, neuromasts are arranged in linear arrays on the x- and y -axes. The vibrating sphere is located at (Dx, Dy , Dz). It vibrates parallel (the black double arrow) to the y -axis generating a dipolar velocity field. Panels (b) and (c) show the velocity amplitudes vx and vx near the fish skin as functions of the x- and y -positions, respectively. The stimulus is an oscillating sphere at (Dx, Dy , Dz)  =  (50, 35, 30). The location of the vibrating sphere can be determined from the velocity distribution., Download figure:, The resulting water velocity vx can be calculated as follows [70]:, Thus, at y   =  0 and z  =  0, it is possible to obtain the distribution of velocity vx along the x-axis. The amplitude of this flow field has one zero, as shown in figure 7(b) (here, x  =  Dx)., The resulting water velocity vy  can be calculated as follows [70]:, Next, by setting x  =  0 and z  =  0, it is possible to obtain the distribution of velocity vy  along the y -axis. The amplitude of this flow field has one maximum with the y -value equal to Dy , as shown in figure 7(c). The amplitude of this flow field has two zeros with a distance between them equal to {{\\Delta }_{3{\\rm D}}}=\\sqrt{2(D_{z}^{2}+D_{x}^{2})}. Finally, the value of Dz can be calculated. As a result, the location (Dx, Dy , Dz) of the vibrating sphere can be determined from the information received by the neuromasts., Rheotaxis is a behavioral orientation in water currents [72]. Previous studies revealed that the lateral line system of fish contributed to their rheotactic behavior. In 1997, Profs. Montgomery and Baker directly demonstrated that rheotaxis could be mediated by the lateral line (one specific receptor class of this system) [19]. In three different fish species, both the pharmacological block of the entire lateral line system and SNs substantially increased the velocity threshold for rheotaxis. However, the ablation of CNs had no effect on the velocity threshold for rheotactic behavior, as shown in figure 8(a). These results demonstrated that SNs made an important contribution to the rheotactic behavior in fish. In 1999, Profs. Baker and Montgomery reported that the effect of pairing an odor stimulant with water current decreased the rheotactic threshold [17]. Their study not only demonstrated that the superficial lateral line system controlled rheotaxis at low current velocities, but also established a link between the mechanosensory lateral line and olfactory systems in the olfactory search behavior of cavefish., Figure 8. (a) Rheotactic responses of the blind Mexican cavefish Astyanax fasciatus under various experimental conditions. The horizontal solid and dotted lines indicate mean  ±  95% confidence intervals of the orientation response in the absence of current.

(b) Graphical representation of various bout types during rheotaxis (reproduced from [20] with permission of Springer Nature)., Download figure:, Suli et al built a system, in which the orientation against a constant water flow (positive rheotaxis) could be quantitatively assessed [21]. They found that zebrafish larvae performed positive rheotaxis and that larvae utilized both the visual and lateral line inputs for this purpose (similar to adult fish). The disruption or damage of hair cells in the absence of vision negatively affected the rheotactic performance that further recovered upon hair cell repair or regeneration., Oteiza et al reported that, in the absence of visual information, larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) performed rheotaxis using flow velocity gradients as the navigational cues [20]. They proposed a novel algorithm based on the local velocity gradients utilized by fish to avoid being dragged by flowing water. As any solid body drifting in a fluid with velocity gradients, larval zebrafish experiences a rotational flow field (or shear) around its perimeter. This rotational flow field was directly related to the local curl of the water volume (\\nabla  ×  V) according to Stokes' theorem, which stated that the integrated curl over the area (a) occupied by the fish body (S) could be measured by computing a line integral around the animal perimeter:, Thus, fish can estimate the local curl at its current position in water by calculating the line integral of the relative water flow around the circumference of its body. As larval zebrafish swims within discrete periods of motor activity (swim bouts) separated by longer inactive inter-bout periods, each swim bout necessarily elicits a change in the gradient experienced by the fish that defines the conditions, at which the subsequent bout will occur. During rheotaxis, swim bouts can be grouped into the bouts that occur after gradient increases (figure 8(b), red) and those that occur after gradient decreases (figure 8(b), blue). The former corresponds to a situation, in which the fish swims towards the area with a high water flow gradient. These results describe a simple rheotactic algorithm that allows larval zebrafish swimming straight after experiencing a decrease in the flow gradient. On the contrary, after experiencing an increase in the flow gradient, it performs a sharp turn in the direction of the flow field rotation., Ultrasensitive and highly accurate flow-sensing abilities of the fish lateral line system have inspired researchers to develop ALL systems. Commercial pressure sensors have been widely used in ALL systems for wake vortex detection. However, such sensors suffer from the low pressure resolution (1 Pa), while the lateral line receptors of fish can detect a pressure gradient as low as 0.001 Pa mm−1 and flow velocities smaller than 10−5 m s−1 [73]. Therefore, ALL sensors with high sensitivity and flexibility that allow emulating both SNs and CNs are in high demand. Since Liu reported the first silicon cantilever-based ALL flow sensors in 2002 [74], various electroactive sensing mechanisms have been explored for these devices, including piezoresistive, capacitive, thermal, optical, magnetic, and piezoelectric ones. By integrating smart flow-sensing structures into a microfluidic chip, various canal ALL systems have been developed, which are discussed in section 3.2. Section 3.3 describes the practical applications of ALL systems in underwater robots., SNs make an important contribution to the rheotactic and predation behaviors of fish [19]. Inspired by the cupula structures of SNs, multiple types of ALL flow sensors have been developed. In addition, MEMS-based biomimetic flow sensors have been briefly reviewed by Tao [22], Zhou [75], and Zhang [76]., Liu's group made a breakthrough in the development of biomimetic flow sensors in 2002, which allowed measuring laminar flows ranging from 0.1 to 1 m s−1 (figure 9(a)) [74]. A silicon piezoresistive cantilever served as the sensing element fabricated using a conventional bulk micromachining technique, and a vertical permalloy cilium coated with parylene was realized using a 3D assembly technique called plastic deformation magnetic assembly. In 2007, they reported another highly sensitive piezoresisitve flow sensor with a detection limit of 0.7 mm s−1 under oscillatory flow in water, in which photodefinable SU-8 epoxy was used to fabricate a high-aspect ratio cilium (figure 9(b)) [77]. In 2007 and 2009, Tsukruk from the Georgia Institute of Technology collaborated with Liu and Coombs to achieve the highest velocity sensitivity threshold of 2.5 µm s−1 with a bioinspired hydrogel capped hair sensory system fabricated by a precision drop-casting method (figure 9(c) and 9(d)) [46, 78]. Although the piezoresistive sensing element remained unchanged in these devices, the high-aspect ratio artificial cupula enhanced their flow detection performance by about two orders of magnitude and endowed the sensors with threshold sensitivities that were comparable with those of fish. With the support from the DARPA Biological Sensory and Structure Emulation (BioSenSE) program, Yang et al developed a thermal hot wire anemometry (HWA) array using a micromachining technology (figure 9(e)) [79]. The out-of-plane HWA with a prong length from 400 to 600 µm consisted of a nickel filament sandwiched between two layers of polyimide, which served as the passivation and structural support. The velocity sensitivities of the individual sensors reached a threshold of 0.2 mm s−1 with a bandwidth of 1 kHz. These devices demonstrated that the ALL could successfully perform dipole source localization and hydrodynamic wake detection. In 2010, Yang and Liu et al reported a novel ALL system by assembling piezoresistive biomimetic flow sensors on the surface of a cylindrical PVC model. They proposed an adaptive beamforming algorithm for dipole localization and demonstrated that the ALL system could accurately localize an artificial dipole source and natural tail-flicking crayfish under various conditions [81]., Figure 9. Various flow sensors inspired by the SNs in fish.

In 2014, they presented an artificial SN micro-sensor array containing a liquid crystal polymer (LCP) membrane, a gold strain gauge, and a Si60 cilium (figure 9(f)) [82]. In spite of the low gauge factor of gold (KAu  =  2) compared with that of piezoresistive silicon (KSi  =  140), a combination of gold strain gauges on LCP exhibited higher flow sensitivity as compared with those of piezoresistive silicon membranes due to the lower Young's modulus of LCP. Si60 polymer cilia with a high aspect ratio of 6.5 were fabricated by stereolithography. These biomimetic micro-sensors demonstrated a high water sensitivity of 0.022 V (m s−1)−1 and threshold velocity detection limit of 15 mm s−1. In 2016, they manufactured a canopy-like nanofibril pyramid around a Si60 polymer cilium by electrospinning and then drop-casted hydrogel cupula on the nanofibril scaffold (figure 9(h)) [83]. In the case of water flow-sensing, the minimum flow velocity detection threshold was 18 mm s−1. In 2015, they reported a flexible biomimetic smart skin consisting of self-powered piezoelectric hair cell flow sensors and demonstrated the ability of individual sensors to detect oscillatory flow velocities as low as 8.2 µm s−1(figure 9(g)) [84]. The piezoelectric flow sensor was composed of a 3 µm thick Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 sensing membrane, on which a high-aspect-ratio Si60 polymer pillar was positioned at the center. 2D flexible arrays of 20 flow sensors were integrated on a flexible LCP substrate to demonstrate the capability of hydrodynamic object localization. As flexible, self-powered, and ultrasensitive flow sensors were in high demand, Miao's group developed biomimetic nanoelectromechanical system flow sensor in 2017 featuring a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber sensing membrane with a hydrogel-infused vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) bundle that mechanically interacted with the flow (figure 9(i)) [85]. The sensor was capable of detecting low flows in both air and water with a velocity detection threshold of 5 mm s−1. The low flow sensitivity was likely due to the limited piezoelectricity of transversely aligned PVDF sensing elements. They also reported a new class of miniature all-polymer flow sensors that closely mimicked the intricate morphology of the mechanosensory ciliary bundles in biological hair cells. The artificial ciliary bundle was composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro-pillars with graded heights and PVDF piezoelectric nanofiber tip links. The sensors achieved a threshold detection limit of 8 µm s−1 (figure 9(j)) [86]. The above-mentioned biomimetic lateral line flow sensors were also reviewed in detail by Bora and Miao et al in 2018 [23]., In addition to the piezoelectric, piezoresistive, and thermal flow sensors, biomimetic flow sensors based on the optical and other sensing mechanisms were also demonstrated. Wolf and van Netten et al reported a novel all-optical 2D flow velocity sensor inspired by the fish lateral line neuromast, which consisted of optical fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) supporting a fluid force recipient sphere (figure 9(k)) [87]. This sensor exhibited a low frequency threshold detection limit of 5 mm s−1 (5 µm s−1 at resonance) with a typical linear dynamic range of 38 dB. As four FBGs were integrated to the fiber supporting cilium, the sensor could determine a flow direction at an accuracy of a few degrees. However, the length of the biomimetic cilium was 64.8 mm, which was approximately 100 times larger than that of the cupula of biological SNs. In 2012, Qualtieri et al designed and built a biomimetic waterproof Si/SiN multilayered cantilever whose internal stress gradient bent the beam out of the plane enabling flow velocity detection in water (figure 9(l)) [88]. Its sensing element consisted of a piezoresistive Nichrome 80/20 alloy layer deposited along the cantilever beam. The proposed sensor was characterized by a dynamic range between 5 and 30 cm s−1 in water. In 2011, Abdulsadda and Tan presented prototypes of polymer-metal composite (IPMC) based ALL sensors, which were manually cut from the larger IPMC sheet fabricated by a planar process. The IPMC flow sensor array exhibited a threshold detection limit of less than 1 mm s−1 and could localize dipole sources located at distances of 4–5 body lengths (figure 9(m)) [89]. In 2012, they fabricated another biomimetic flow sensor array by micromachining, in which micro polymer-metal composite IPMC beams were attached perpendicularly to the substrate to effectively interact with the flow (figure 9(m)) [90]. Table 2 summarizes the parameters of various ALL flow sensors, including their transduction mechanisms, dimensions, and threshold detection limits., Table 2. Parameters of the artificial SN sensors based on different operation principles., l: length; w: width; t: thickness; h: height; d: diameter., The diaphragm-based pressure sensors fabricated by silicon micromachining can be integrated into ALL systems for the detection of surface pressures. In 2007, Fernandez and Triantafyllu from MIT proposed a lateral line inspired pressure senor array consisting of hundreds of MEMS pressure sensors with diameters near 1 mm spaced a few millimeters apart and fabricated on etched silicon and Pyrex wafers (figure 10(a)). The sensing element was a strain gauge mounted on a silicon diaphragm, and the pressure resolution of the sensors was approximately 1 Pa [91]. In 2012, Yaul et al reported a flexible sensor array, which was composed of a PDMS canal with a strain-concentrating diaphragm and four resistive strain gauges fabricated from conductive carbon black-PDMS composites (figure 10(b)) [92]. The sensors achieved a pressure resolution of 1.5 Pa using a 16-bit analog/digital converter. Despite their ability to transduce underwater pressure variations produced by moving objects and surface waves, the conductive polymer sensors exhibited lower sensitivity as compared with that of silicon piezoresistive sensors. In 2016, Dusek and Triantafyllou et al developed a waterproof conformal pressure sensor array containing carbon black-doped silicone closed-cell (CBPDMS) foam (figure 10(c)). Although the CBPDMS foam sensor arrays exhibited significant advantages over the existing commercial sensors for distributed flow reconstruction and control, their threshold detection limit was as high as 5 Pa [93]. The arrays of these pressure sensors were practically used for underwater detection; however, their canal-based sensing mechanisms were not elucidated., Figure 10. Various pressure sensors inspired by the CNs of fish.

(g) A schematic showing the structural details of the fully flexible ALL canal system proposed by Jiang et al in 2017 [96]., Download figure:, In contrast to the conventional diaphragm-based pressure sensors, the ALL pressure sensors exhibit a canal structure with aligned pores on the canal surface and flow-sensing elements inside the canal. Therefore, they are able to detect pressure gradients along the surface instead of the absolute pressure. The pressure difference between the canal pores drives the canal fluid, which is opposed by the friction generated due to the canal walls. At the low frequency range, the frictional forces dominate the response and thus result in lower activation of the CN sensor [84]. Morever, the displacement of water particles outside the canal is larger than that inside the canal in low frequency domain, resulting in the high-pass filter nature. Most transduction mechanisms used in flow velocity sensors are applicable to ALL pressure sensors. In 2011, Liu and Bleckmann et al developed a canal ALL for hydrodynamic detection using previously reported piezoresistive biomimetic SN sensors and PDMS canals, and its noise-rejection capability was demonstrated (figure 10(d)) [94]. In 2015, Herzog et al proposed a new flow sensor mimicking the canal neuromast of the fish lateral line by placing light-guided PDMS lamella into a canal (figure 10(e)) [67]. The assembled sensor consisted of a Si-chip with two lamellae, light-emitting diodes, segmented photodiodes, housing, and electronics for amplification and analysis. The deflection of the lamella induced by pressure gradients changes the light intensity measured on each receptive segment of the photodiode and produces a directional response of the sensor. These sensors were able to detect a fluid flow velocity of 185 µm s−1 inside the canal. In addition, the artificial CNs could detect flow fluctuations, when the sensor pores were sealed by PDMS membranes [95]., In 2014, Kottapalli and Miao et al presented a MEMS CN sensor by integrating LCP MEMS sensing membranes, high-aspect ratio Si60 pillars, and a PDMS canal as shown in figure 10(f) [82]. The experimental results demonstrated that the canal structure completely filtered away the direct current (DC) flow at all flow velocities ranging from 0 to 275 mm s−1. In 2015, they reported another artificial MEMS CN sensor, which consisted of three major components: a piezoelectric MEMS sensing membrane, a high-aspect ratio hair cell, and a biomimetic canal. It was found that the artificial MEMS CN sensor could reject the noises generated by the DC and low frequency alternating current (AC) flows. In 2017, Jiang et al developed a canal ALL system by integrating cantilevered flow-sensing elements in a PDMS canal (figure 10(g)) [96], which demonstrated high-pass filtering capabilities to attenuate low-frequency stimuli and a pressure gradient detection limit of approximately 11 Pa m−1 at resonance., Various canal lateral line-based pressure sensors have been developed, and some of these devices utilized a constriction structure in the lateral line canal to locally enhance the flow velocity and thereby improve the sensitivity of the sensor [67]. Ma et al proposed a flexible canal ALL system with constriction in canal nearby CN sensor [97]. The flexible sensing elements were fabricated from poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) employing reactive ion etching (RIE) process [98]. The experimental results suggested that the ALL with constriction canal exhibited higher sensitivity as compared with that of the ALL with a normal straight canal. However, their pressure detection limits or pressure gradients were rarely reported in the corresponding studies. In addition, most biomimetic canals were manufactured from PDMS, which led to many challenges in their practical applications due to its low elastic modulus., Inspired by the rheotactic and schooling behaviors of fish, roboticists have been working on the development of underwater technologies capable of recognizing and characterizing Karman vortex streets through flow sensing, which can increase the propulsion efficiency and stability of an underwater robot under turbulent conditions., In the framework of the Fish Locomotion and. Sensing (FILOSE) project, Venturelli and Akanyeti constructed a sensor platform in 2012, which accommodated two laterally distributed pressure arrays to mimic the trunk canal lateral line system (figure 11(a)) [99]. They reported that the distributed pressure sensors had the capability to discriminate Kármán vortex streets in uniform flows and determine the orientation and position of the platform with respect to the incoming flow and central axis of the Karman vortex street. In 2013, Akanyeti et al developed a fish-shaped model containing nine pressure sensors around its head (figure 11(b)). By moving it forward and backward harmonically, they analyzed the effect of self-motion on the surface pressure of the model. It was found that the pressure signals were more sensitive to the acceleration of the craft than to low swimming velocities (<0.2 body length s−1). The distributed pressure sensors could both detect the external hydrodynamic events occurring around the model and monitor the self-motion of the craft [100]. In 2014, using the same fish-shaped model, Chambers and Akanyeti et al investigated the Karman vortex streets formed behind a cylinder at different flow velocities. They concluded that the pressure difference detected by the front and side sensors in the frontal plane provided a useful measure of the transition from the steady to an unsteady flow, and that the vortex shedding frequency and its magnitude could be used to differentiate the source size and the flow speed [101]. In 2018, Yanagitsuru et al inserted commercial pressure sensors into physical fish head models with various widths and placed them in steady and vortical flows [102], as shown in figure 11(c). They found that all model heads exhibited the highest SNR ratios in the vortices with intermediate flow speeds; however, at each head width, the SNR level was passively optimized for differently sized vortices, which might have implications for refuge and prey seeking. These results have provided insight into the sensory ecology of fishes and can be potentially used for designing autonomous underwater vehicles., Figure 11. Robotic fish equipped with commercial pressure sensors inspired by the fish lateral line system.

(g) A prototype of the ALL system consisting of nine underwater commercial pressure sensors (reproduced from [109] with permission of Springer)., Download figure:, Inspired by the fish lateral line system, Xie et al designed a robotic boxfish integrated with commercial pressure sensors that were distributed symmetrically along each side of the fish as shown in figure 11(d). In 2014, they demonstrated that the swimming speed of robotic fish could be determined from pressure information, which made the fish aware of its motion status [103]. In 2018, they reported the local sensing between two adjacent robotic fish [104]. By measuring hydrodynamic pressure variations using the ALL system and extracting meaningful information from the pressure sensor readings, the oscillating frequency/amplitude/offset of the adjacent robotic fish, relative vertical distance, and relative yaw/pitch/roll angle between the robotic fish and its neighbor were sensed efficiently., In 2016, Strokina et al proposed a bioinspired sensor probe consisting of an ALL sensor array for the in situ measurements of complex natural flow patterns (e.g. for the evaluation of hydraulic structures in a river) and introduced the bulk flow velocity and flow angle as the chosen pattern primitives [105]. In 2018, Tuhtan et al built a fish-shaped lateral line probe equipped with 11 high-speed time-synchronized pressure transducers to capture and classify flows in fish passage structures (figure 11(e)) [106]. The hydrodynamic signatures based on the collection of the probability distributions of pressure fluctuations can be used to automatically classify distinct flow regions within the pools of three different vertical slot fishways. Field data obtained by operational fishway measurements were sampled and classified using an ALL for the first time, providing a completely new source of bioinspired flow information., In 2015, Asadnia et al established the applicability of MEMS flow sensors for sensing and control applications of an underwater robotic stingray. A predictive control system has been applied by relying on the developed MEMS sensors that could successfully guide the robotic stingray to track a desired trajectory [107]. In 2018, Liu et al developed an ALL system composed of 25 micro-pressure sensors by imitating the mechanism of fish CNs, as shown in figure 11(f) [108]. The optimal sensor distribution model and underwater environment perception algorithm were obtained through hydrodynamic simulations. The proposed ALL system allowed flow velocity estimation and attitude perception in a turbulent flow as well as recognition of obstacle shapes using a neural network algorithm. In 2018, Zheng et al proposed an ALL system consisting of nine underwater commercial pressure sensors that formed a cross-shaped sensor array (figure 11(g)) [109]. The obtained experimental results indicated that the cross-shaped ALL system was able to localize the target dipole source located two body lengths away. The optimal perceptual distance between this system and the sensing array was below 13 cm. Moreover, decreasing the data sampling interval and increasing the number of utilized sensors can significantly improve the positioning accuracy., In 2013, Lagor et al presented an ALL system composed of pressure sensors for a bioinspired robotic fish capable of the autonomous flow-speed estimation and rheotaxis [110]. They achieved the model-based rheotaxis control of a fish robot based on the results of pressure difference measurements without first training an empirical or fluid-mechanical model to match the flow field conditions. In 2015, Zhang et al proposed a novel flexible fish robot equipped with distributed pressure sensors for flow sensing [111]. They presented a systematic approach to distributed flow sensing for the closed-loop speed control of a flexible fish robot by regulating the flapping amplitude. In 2015, DeVries et al developed a robotic prototype outfitted with a multi-modal ALL system composed of ionic polymer metal composite (a velocity sensor) and commercial pressure sensors [112]. They experimentally demonstrated the distributed flow-sensing and closed-loop control strategies. The proposed closed-loop control algorithms incorporating estimated flow field properties allowed an underwater vehicle to emulate the rheotaxis and station holding behaviors. In 2018, using the potential flow theory, recursive Bayesian filtering, and trajectory-tracking feedback control, Free and Paley demonstrated a bioinspired array of pressure sensors on a Joukowski foil to estimate and control flow-relative position in a Karman vortex street [113]. The closed-loop control experiments conducted in a flow tank showed that the ALL in conjunction with the potential flow model and Bayesian estimator allowed the robot to perform fish-like slaloming behavior in a Karman vortex street., Several other robotic models integrated with commercial pressure sensors for hydrodynamic sensing were reported in the literature [114–116]. The majority of demonstrations used commercial pressure sensors with a detection limit of approximately 1 Pa, which was a bottleneck for practical applications. It should be noted that few robotic fish integrated with artificial SN sensors have been developed, as no commercially available sensors for external flow detection currently exist., The lateral line of fish provided strong inspiration for the design of ALL sensors. As a result, various SN and CN sensors with improved sensitivity and flexibility were constructed, and several of them were placed onto underwater robots for evaluation experiments. However, multiple technological challenges must be resolved for the practical implementation of the ALL system, which include its sensitivity, noise, durability, stability, and sensor fusion methodology., The lateral line is an intrinsically sensory organ for the near-field flow perception with a detection range of 3–5 body lengths, as the pressure fluctuations surrounding the fish are relatively small. The best sensitivities of CNs and SNs are tuned to their specific frequencies for predation, mating, and schooling. In the case of ALL sensors, the most sensitive artificial SN sensor exhibits a flow detection threshold of approximately 2.5 µm s−1, and the minimum detectable pressure gradient of the ALL canal system is approximately 11 Pa m−1 [46, 96]. To increase the sensitivity of ALL sensors, it is important to take the resonance frequency of the sensing element into account. However, this principle cannot be applied to the diaphragm-based pressure sensors. There are limited CN sensors developed, compared with the SN sensors. A large scope of work is required to be conducted ahead in the CN sensor development. CN-inspired sensors would improve the robustness of artificial MEMS sensors, as the microfluidic canal encapsulation of the hair cells brings a mechanical protection to the hair cells from accidental damage [23]. Moreover, CN sensors employ constrictions at the location of the sensing elements can locally enhance the flow velocity and thereby improve their sensitivity [67, 97]., Hydrodynamic noise is ubiquitous in an aquatic environment, even in apparently quiet ponds and lakes. The increase in the water speed promotes the high-frequency water oscillation. Fish are able to filter out meaningful signals and reduce the level of hydrodynamic noise via mechanical filtering mechanisms, which were theoretically analyzed by van Netten et al [41]. In addition to the mechanical filtering based on the cupula resonance and canal effect, it is most likely that the output signals of the hair cells in the same neuromast are averaged for noise reduction. However, it is technically problematic to use this averaging scheme for each artificial neuromast sensor, which consists of one or two sensing elements. In addition, both piezoresistive and piezoelectric sensors suffer from the strong electromagnetic interference caused by impedance. Hence, the preamplifier must be integrated close to the sensing element., ALL sensors based on flexible electronics can be mounted on the curved surface of underwater robots. Piezoelectric polymers, polymer-based conductive nanocomposites, and IPMC have been widely used as the sensing materials for ALL sensors. PVDF and its copolymers exhibit extremely high piezoelectric voltage constants and, therefore, are suitable for the detection of underwater flow and vibration. Various conductive nanocomposites based on graphene, carbon black, and CNT fillers with very high gauge factors comparable to that of silicon piezoresistors have been developed. However, the stability of the polymer-based strain sensors is outweighed by the serious technological challenges caused by the inherent creeping deformation of polymers. Few reports were focused on the stability of flexible ALL sensors that suffered from temperature fluctuations and pressure variations. In addition, most artificial CN sensors utilize PDMS and other elastomers to fabricate ALL canals due to the well-established PDMS fabrication process. Owing to the low elastic modulus of PDMS, the deformation of ALL canals leads to high sensitivity variations of the artificial CN sensors., Waterproofing is a crucial issue for underwater sensors, as they have to be exposed to an aqueous environment for a long time. Poor waterproof properties of the sensing elements may cause a short circuit and change their mechanical behavior, resulting in a sensor fault. One of the most popular approaches to solving this problem is to coat a parylene C layer on the sensor surface by chemical vapor deposition [88, 117]; in this case, the thickness of the parylene coating should be larger than 8 µm [118]. The adhesion strength between the parylene coating and the sensor surface can be improved by treating the latter with a dilute isopropyl alcohol-water solution of organic silane gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (A-174) [119] or plasma [120]. Another approach is to apply an Al2O3 and parylene bilayer coating, which has been widely used for the capsulation of implantable neural arrays to achieve long-term stability [121, 122]. In addition, anti-fouling coating should be performed to prevent the attachment of microorganisms and dust particles on the sensor surface., Many ALL systems are composed of sensors arranged in a regular linear pattern, which significantly differ from the biological fish lateral line system. As described in section 2.1, regardless of the trunk SN distribution, some SNs (functioning as velocity sensors) are always closely associated with the lateral line canals, which might give an inspiration for the spatial arrangement of flow sensors. In addition, the intervals between the sensors should be determined by considering the sensor spacing, sensitivity, and system topology distribution. For example, the optimization of the sensor distribution can reduce the number of sensors and economic costs., Fish use the lateral line system based on both CNs and SNs for flow perception. The sensing fusion of the pressure and flow receptors plays an important role in the lateral line system as the polarized SNs and CNs are well arranged on the lateral line scales. Fish can first estimate the direction of a vibrating source using polarized SNs, after which it determines the distance to the vibrating source precisely through the sensing fusion of SNs and CNs. The latter can likely improve the stability and accuracy of the lateral line system, as one sensing modality can calibrate another modality. The observability of the flow properties that are only weakly detectable by one modality is also enhanced by the fusion of SNs and CNs. However, there are few studies in which ALL systems with the sensing fusion mechanism are currently being developed [119]. Hence, it is very promising to develop an ALL system containing both artificial CNs and SNs to mimic the sensing fusion mechanism of the fish lateral line system., The lateral line system of fish helps them to obtain hydrodynamic information effectively and plays an important role in their communication, schooling, and predation behaviors. In this paper, we reviewed the recent findings in the morphology, function, and sensing algorithms of the lateral line system. Owing to the recent advances in the fields of smart materials, flexible electronics, and microfabrication technology, ALL sensors based on various sensing modalities have been developed. Although roboticists utilized the ALL to demonstrate the hydrodynamic sensing capability of underwater robots, the sensitivity, stability, and durability of the current ALL systems must be improved for their practical applications in the real environments. More advanced sensing fusion algorithms and integration techniques are required for the next generation of ALL sensors., This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51575027).","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/041001"},{"title":"Canal neuromasts enhance foraging in zebrafish (Danio rerio)","authors":"Andres Carrillo, Dan Van Le, Margaret Byron, Houshuo Jiang, Matthew J McHenry","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"10 April 2019","abstract":"Aquatic animals commonly sense flow using superficial neuromasts (SNs), which are receptors that extend from the body's surface. The lateral line of fishes is unique among these systems because it additionally possesses receptors, the canal neuromasts (CNs), that are recessed within a channel. The lateral line has inspired the development of engineered sensors and concepts in the analysis of flow fields for submersible navigation. The biophysics of CNs are known to be different from the SNs and thereby offer a distinct submodality. However, it is generally unclear whether CNs play a distinct role in behavior. We therefore tested whether CNs enhance foraging in the dark by zebrafish (Danio rerio), a behavior that we elicited with a vibrating rod. We found that juvenile fish, which have only SNs, bite at this rod at about one-third the rate and from as little as one-third the distance of adults for a high-frequency stimulus (50  <  f   <  100 Hz). We used novel techniques for manipulating the lateral line in adults to find that CNs offered only a modest benefit at a lower frequency (20 Hz) and that foraging was mediated entirely by cranial neuromasts. Consistent with our behavioral results, biophysical models predicted CNs to be more than an order of magnitude more sensitive than SNs at high frequencies. This enhancement helps to overcome the rapid spatial decay in high-frequency components in the flow around the stimulus. These findings contrast what has been previously established for fishes that are at least ten-times the length of zebrafish, which use trunk CNs to localize prey. Therefore, CNs generally enhance foraging, but in a manner that varies with the size of the fish and its prey. These results have the potential to improve our understanding of flow sensing in aquatic animals and engineered systems.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/035003"},{"title":"Bottom-level motion control for robotic fish to swim in groups: modeling and experiments","authors":"Liang Li, Anquan Liu, Wei Wang, Sridhar Ravi, Rubin Fu, Junzhi Yu, Guangming Xie","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"2 May 2019","abstract":"Moving in groups is an amazing spectacle of collective behaviour in fish and has attracted considerable interest from many fields, including biology, physics and engineering. Although robotic fish have been well studied, including algorithms to simulate group swimming, experiments that demonstrate multiple robotic fish as a stable group are yet to be achieved. One of the challenges is the lack of a robust bottom-level motion control system for robotic fish platforms. Here we seek to overcome this challenge by focusing on the design and implementation of a motion controller for robotic fish that allows multiple individuals to swim in groups. As direction control is essential in motion control, we first propose a high-accuracy controller which can control a sub-carangiform robotic fish from one arbitrary position/pose (position and direction) to another. We then develop a hydrodynamic-model-based simulation platform to expedite the process of the parameter tuning of the controller. The accuracy of the simulation platform was assessed by comparing the results from experiments on a robotic fish using speeding and turning tests. Subsequently, extensive simulations and experiments with robotic fish were used to verify the accuracy and robustness of the bottom-level motion control. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our controller by implementing group swimming using three robotic fish swimming freely in prescribed trajectories. Although the fluid environment can be complex during group swimming, our bottom-level motion control remained nominally accurate and robust. This motion control strategy lays a solid foundation for further studies of group swimming with multiple robotic fish.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046001"},{"title":"Musculoskeletal design, control, and application of human mimetic humanoid Kenshiro","authors":"Yuki Asano, Kei Okada, Masayuki Inaba","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"8 April 2019","abstract":"We have been developing a human mimetic musculoskeletal humanoid called Kenshiro, whose design concept is to thoroughly pursue an unprecedented anatomical fidelity to the human musculoskeletal structure.

In this model, the fluid dynamics is simulated by solving the Navier–Stokes equations using a finite-volume method based on an overset, multi-block structured grid system. The bony rays embedded in the fin are modeled as nonlinear Euler–Bernoulli beams. To demonstrate the capability of this model, we numerically investigate the effect of various ray stiffness distributions on the deformation and propulsion performance of a 3D caudal fin. Our numerical results show that with specific ray stiffness distributions, certain caudal fin deformation patterns observed in real fish (e.g. the cupping deformation) can be reproduced through passive structural deformations. Among the four different stiffness distributions (uniform, cupping, W-shape and heterocercal) considered here, we find that the cupping distribution requires the least power expenditure. The uniform distribution, on the other hand, performs the best in terms of thrust generation and efficiency. The uniform stiffness distribution, per se, also leads to 'cupping' deformation patterns with relatively smaller phase differences between various rays. The present model paves the way for future work on dynamics of skeleton-reinforced membranes.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/036012"},{"title":"Emergence of behavior through morphology: a case study on an octopus inspired manipulator","authors":"Thomas George Thuruthel, Egidio Falotico, Federico Renda, Tamar Flash, Cecilia Laschi","origin":"Note","pub_date":"24 April 2019","abstract":"The complex motion abilities of the Octopus vulgaris have been an intriguing research topic for biologists and roboticists alike.

This sheds light on the underlying optimality principles that these biological systems employ. Open loop control policies are obtained through a trajectory optimization method on a learned forward dynamic model. The motion patterns emerging from variations in morphology and environment were then derived to study the role of the body and environment. Results show that for the specific case of dynamic reaching with a soft appendage, the invariance in motion profile is a fundamental constraint imposed by the morphology and environment, independent from the controller. This suggests how morphological design can simplify stable control even for highly dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems and can provide insights into design of new soft robotic mechanisms.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/034001"},{"title":"Learning bioinspired joint geometry from motion capture data of bat flight","authors":"Matthew Bender, Jia Guo, Nathan Powell, Andrew Kurdila, Rolf Müller","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"10 April 2019","abstract":"Bioinspired robotic systems are often designed by assuming that the kinematics of the biological system of interest are well approximated by an open kinematic chain subject to box constraints.
