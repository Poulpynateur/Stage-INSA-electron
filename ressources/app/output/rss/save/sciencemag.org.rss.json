[{"abstract":"By Helen SantoroMay. 14, 2019 , 7:00 AM, If you ever come across a group of snails, chances are most of their shells coil to the right. Until recently, scientists didn’t know why this was the case. Now, researchers have found the gene that makes this right-coiling happen in freshwater snails (Lymnaea stagnalis)., For the first time, scientists used CRISPR, a tool that edits genes, successfully in snails. They mutated a gene called Lsdia1, which had been suggested in previous studies to be involved in shell coiling. Gastropods without a functional version of the gene produced offspring with shells that coiled to the left (pictured), researchers report today in the journal Development. These changes in shell coiling could be seen as early as the embryo stage., It’s still not clear how Lsdia1 controls shell coiling all by itself. Scientists think it may encode a special protein that is involved in regulating cells’ internal skeleton, but more tests still need to be done., Genes like Lsdia1 are found throughout the animal kingdom, meaning similar mechanisms may be influencing left-right asymmetry in other species, scientists note.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/DSC_32432abe-1280x720.jpg?itok=S958jbu_","title":"Most snail shells coil to the right.

This is the first ammonite and one of the very first marine organisms ever found in amber; because the gemstone is fossilized tree resin, it traps mostly land organisms., The specimen (above) came to light when a collector in Shanghai, China, bought it for about $750 from a dealer who claimed it was a land snail. Under the x-rays of a computerized tomography scanner, though, the shell revealed the intricate internal chambers characteristic of ammonites., The ammonite’s precise type confirms the Burmese amber is from the Cretaceous period, as previous dating studies have argued. But the 3-centimeter-long piece of ancient resin is a veritable surf and turf of land and sea creatures, also preserving at least 40 other animals—mites, spiders, millipedes, cockroaches, beetles, flies, wasps, and marine gastropods, the researchers report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences., To explain this unique amber piece, researchers have conjured up three scenarios. Perhaps resin dripped down from a forest next to a beach, catching first land critters and then seashells. Or a tsunami flooded low-lying trees, washing sea creatures into resin pools. Or, possibly, storm winds simply blew seashells into the forest. Regardless, scientists say, it’s a welcome surprise.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/200432-1280x720.jpg?itok=3z1dRS5W","title":"Extinct squid relative entombed in amber for 100 million years","authors":"Joshua Sokol","pub_date":"May. 13, 2019 , 3:00 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/extinct-squid-relative-entombed-amber-100-million-years"},{"abstract":"By Helen SantoroMay. 13, 2019 , 3:00 PM, When we think of how spiders hunt, we usually picture intricate webs that can ensnare passing insects. But the triangle weaver spider (Hyptiotes cavatus)—native to the United States and Canada—does something special: It creates a slingshot with its silk web to catapult itself forward and capture its prey., To watch the spiders at work, scientists recorded them using high-speed videos. They saw that the arachnids stretch and tighten their silk threads, using their body as a bridge between the anchor line and the web (as seen in the photo above) and can hold the web under tension for hours on end. When prey wanders into the web, the spider releases its hold and uses the silk’s stored energy to shoot forward at extraordinary speeds, the researchers report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The web then wraps around the prey from all directions, blocking any chance of escape., According to scientists, this is the only known example of an arachnid using a device to boost its power—thus revealing a new function of spider silk.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/200443-1280x720.jpg?itok=MkRU_mBH","title":"This spider turns its web into a slingshot, flinging itself at prey","authors":"Helen Santoro","pub_date":"May. 13, 2019 , 3:00 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/spider-turns-its-web-slingshot-flinging-itself-prey"},{"abstract":"By Matthew HutsonMay. 10, 2019 , 3:20 PM, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA—Computers can master some tasks—like playing a game of Go—through trial and error. But what works for a game doesn’t work for risky real-world tasks like driving a car, where “losing” might involve a high-speed collision. To drive safely, humans have an exquisite feedback system: our fight-or-flight response, in which physiological reactions like a rapid heart rate and sweaty palms signal “fear,” and so keep us vigilant and, theoretically, out of trouble. Now, researchers at Microsoft are giving artificial intelligence (AI) programs a rough analog of anxiety to help them sense when they’re pushing their luck., The scientists placed sensors on people’s fingers to record pulse amplitude while they were in a driving simulator, as a measure of arousal. An algorithm used those recordings—80 minutes divided among four people—to learn to predict an average person’s pulse amplitude at each moment on the course. It then used those “fear” signals as a guide while learning to drive through the virtual world: If a human would be scared here, it might muse, “I’m doing something wrong.” AIs using this method still had to crash to learn safe driving skills, but they required 25% fewer crashes to reach the same level of performance as a nonfearful AI, the researchers reported this week at the International Conference on Learning Representations here., The researchers wondered whether this kind of arousal was just a rough proxy for distance to walls, so they trained another AI to drive using wall proximity instead of fear. But fear proved more useful, likely because it encodes a richer set of expectations, including the feeling of turning too rapidly, the paper hypothesizes., Emotions help humans learn and make decisions, and researchers say this paper is a proof of concept that giving AIs viscerallike responses can bring their abilities closer to our own. It also suggests another application: training autonomous vehicles to avoid driving in a way that makes passengers uncomfortable or car sick, even if it’s safe.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/driving_16x9.jpg?itok=oVFyM9WE","title":"Scientists teach computers fear—to make them better drivers","authors":"Matthew Hutson","pub_date":"May. 10, 2019 , 3:20 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/scientists-teach-computers-fear-make-them-better-drivers"},{"abstract":"By Jeffrey MervisMay. 13, 2019 , 5:30 PM, The much-admired system to review grant proposals at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, has become the latest flashpoint in a long-running battle between Congress and the executive branch over how the U.S. government manages advisory bodies., NIH’s parent body, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in Washington, D.C., opposes legislation moving rapidly through Congress that is aimed at making those committees more transparent. The department says that if the bill becomes law, its requirements could cause monthslong delays in appointing reviewers to NIH study sections and create massive amounts of additional paperwork. In addition, “requiring [NIH peer reviewers] to go through this process could be a major disincentive to service,” HHS argued in a 9 April letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R–KY)., Supporters of the bill say they responded to HHS’s concerns, first expressed in a similar letter sent to McConnell last year, by tweaking the bill to exempt NIH study sections. But HHS officials are now demanding the exclusion of all HHS advisory bodies, including those at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, they say. Such a blanket exemption would gut the proposed reforms, proponents argue., An NIH spokesperson, Renate Myles, says “NIH does not comment on pending legislation.” But NIH officials are fuming about the bill, according to one congressional staffer who’s familiar with the issue and requested anonymity. “We’ve been told that NIH will burn down the Capitol if this passes,” the staffer says., Advocacy groups, meanwhile, have split on the issue. Biomedical research groups are worried about the bill’s potential impact on NIH. But environmental groups say any additional red tape is a small price to pay for increased government transparency., At issue is a 1972 law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). FACA governs the thousands of advisory committees serving federal agencies. It sets rules for appointing members and conducting meetings, often requiring panels to include members with varying points of view and backgrounds and to open their work to the public., For decades, however, there have been complaints that many federal agencies have found ways to defeat FACA’s requirements. Under former President George W. Bush, for example, watchdog groups complained that some advisory panels were inappropriately hiding their work, and that administration officials were requiring pledges of political loyalty from prospective appointees to panels dealing with energy and environmental regulations., In response to such practices, Representative William Lacy Clay (D–MO) has repeatedly introduced bills to reform FACA that have won overwhelmingly bipartisan support. For example, the chairman of the staunchly conservative House Freedom Caucus, Representative Mark Meadows (R–NC), praised the liberal Clay as a “tireless advocate for this important reform” shortly before the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed this year’s version, H.R. 1608, on 12 March., Now, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is set to take up the bill on Wednesday. In advance of that vote, HHS delivered its 9 April letter detailing its concerns., “HHS opposes this bill,” the letter declares, citing several elements it finds objectionable., One is a provision requiring agencies to designate advisory panel members who review grant applications as special government employee (SGEs). That would put into law what is already supposed to be a government-wide policy. Such SGEs must declare any conflicts of interest on a standard government form that remains confidential, as well as filling out other documents pertaining to their professional activities., At NIH, defining reviewers as SGEs would be a big change. The agency now classifies its study section members as consultants in order to exempt them from the paperwork requirements that come with being an SGE. NIH also uses its own form for panelists to report potential conflicts. The variations are permitted under the Public Health Service Act that governs NIH’s behavior, according to HHS, and H.R. 1608 would wreak havoc with long-standing NIH practices., “It could jeopardize NIH’s peer review process,” wrote Matthew Bassett, HHS’s assistant secretary for legislation. “Appointing individual SGEs requires the completion of 13 forms, one of which must be notarized, totaling 94 pages. … The appointment and ethics review process could take months.”, Many scientists may not be willing to run that gauntlet, the letter speculates. Reviewers volunteer their time “out of professional courtesy,” Bassett writes. “Requiring [reviewers] to go through this process could be a major disincentive to service.”, Some biomedical research advocacy groups have echoed those concerns. Clay’s bill “could have unintended consequences harmful to patients and taxpayers,” Mary Woolley of Research!America in Arlington, Virginia, and Jeff Allen of Friends of Cancer Research in Washington, D.C., warned McConnell last year after the House approved a similar bill. “These consequences include hamstringing the peer-review process at NIH, compromising the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to thoroughly and efficiently evaluate the safety and effectiveness of new medical advances, and adding more administrative time and costs to the advisory committee process than is necessary to meet legislative intent,” they wrote in April 2018., But environmental activists view the changes in a much more positive light. “I don’t think the scientific community should set itself apart” from meeting the goals of FACA, says Andrew Rosenberg, head of the Union of Concerned Scientists’s Center for Science and Democracy in Washington, D.C., which has filed numerous suits claiming the Environmental Protection Agency and other federal agencies haven’t followed FACA rules., Complying with FACA “might become a little more inconvenient” for agencies under the new law, “but I don’t think it’s crippling,” says Rosenberg, a professor of natural resources at the University of New Hampshire in Durham and former senior official at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “And there are a lot of benefits from being able to say that the [peer-review] process is totally transparent.”, At the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Alexandria, Virginia, which also relies on advisory panels to review mountains of grant applications annually, officials have not yet taken an official stance on the legislation, says Lawrence Rudolph, NSF’s general counsel. But the agency has long followed requirements that are included in the bill, Rudolph says, and “we have not found them to be onerous or burdensome.”, To understand what’s at stake, it’s necessary to look at differences between how NIH and NSF implement FACA when it comes to assembling the panels that review funding applications., At NIH, most of the peer-review work is done through standing committees called study sections, which typically meet three times a year. Scientists typically serve a 4-year term, although study sections also use ad hoc members for their expertise in specialized areas. In contrast, NSF merit review is conducted by one-off panels convened by program managers to handle each round of proposals that come in over the transom or in response to a particular solicitation., It’s a massive logistical challenge. NIH enlists as many as 35,000 reviewers for 173 study sections in any given year; NSF taps roughly half that number of scientists. Last year, it cost NSF $56 million to run the panels; NIH’s costs are much higher because of the larger volume., At both agencies, the grant review groups already fall within the purview of FACA, as do the higher-level bodies that provide strategic advice (councils for each NIH institute, and committees for every NSF directorate). NIH and NSF provide a limited amount of information about the makeup of those review panels—NIH posts the name and institutional affiliations of every member before each study section meets, for example, while NSF posts an annual master list of its reviewers on a government-wide website without identifying the specific panel on which they served., One reason HHS says it objects to H.R. 1608 is because it would require NIH to collect and provide more information about each committee member, including their expertise and any potential conflicts of interest. That requirement, which goes along with defining reviewers as special government employees, will create burdensome paperwork and delays in appointments, HHS argues., At NSF, in contrast, Rudolph says meeting the bill’s requirements won’t be a problem. That’s because NSF has defined its reviewers as special government employees and collected the needed information ever since FACA went into effect. “We thought it would be a good way to ensure the integrity of the review process,” he explains. “And we don’t think the time frame required to appoint them is of any consequence. Finding the people most qualified in that particular area is the real controlling factor.”, H.R. 1608 would also prevent agencies from creating advisory bodies, such subcommittees or working groups, that are not subject to FACA’s open-meetings requirement because they technically report only to a FACA committee, not the agency itself. At NIH, if that ban had been in effect last year, it would have affected the way agency officials organized an advisory group that examined the hot-button issue of foreign influences on U.S.-funded researchers. Created in August 2018 and comprised of university presidents and other senior academic leaders, it met in private and surfaced only to report its findings in December 2018 to the NIH director’s advisory council, which is covered by FACA., Biomedical advocacy groups admit they were caught by surprise when the bill passed the House in March. They are still reviewing what was changed since last year’s version, but most appear skeptical the changes go far enough., “We want a blanket exemption for all NIH study sections,” says Jennifer Zeitzer, director of legislative relations for the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Bethesda, which is preparing a public statement on the legislation. “The intent [of Clay’s bill] is good, but we worry about the negative impact on individuals who agree to serve.”, Clay says his bill would grant NIH an exemption and that HHS has misrepresented the outcome of negotiations held last fall after Senator Lamar Alexander (R–TN), at the request of NIH and HHS officials, blocked a previous version of the bill from coming up for a Senate vote., “The fixes made in the current version of the bill are much more accommodating than ever before,” Clay says. “I have included significant changes requested by HHS/NIH. But exempting all HHS panels is simply not acceptable.”, “The [new] language came from HHS,” says a Democratic committee aide. “This is what they asked us to put in to solve the problem, and we did. Now they are running around telling people that the bill is terrible and that the sky is going to fall, without acknowledging the significant concessions that we made.”, The broader exemption that HHS is arguing for raises numerous problems, supporters of H.R. 1608 say. It would allow FDA, for instance, to appoint representatives from drug companies or other parties with potential conflicts of interest to influential advisory committees that are not subject to FACA. That “is absurd,” says the committee aide. “We’re never going to agree to that.”, Exempting NIH “is not the ideal scenario,” the aide adds. “But in a show of good faith, Mr. Clay and [the authorizing Senate committee] agreed to add the language that HHS requested to exempt NIH from certain provisions because agency officials felt it would such a burden and harm their peer-review groups.”, It’s unlikely that the Senate panel will have found a compromise by the time it takes up the bill on Wednesday. But Rosenberg is hoping that legislators will keep trying., “We are facing some serious problems because of how this administration is managing scientific advisory panels,” he says. “Would I like to exempt NIH panels? Sure. But not at the expense of righting the ship.”, Rosenberg worries that Alexander or another senator might again accede to HHS’s wishes and block the bill from being taken up by the full Senate. “Another hold could kill it,” he says. “And we need to make sure that FACA is doing what it’s supposed to do.”","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/Capitol%20dome%20with%20flag.jpg?itok=CyeAWzFf","title":"NIH fears good-government bill would hamper peer review","authors":"Jeffrey Mervis","pub_date":"May. 13, 2019 , 5:30 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/nih-fears-good-government-bill-would-hamper-peer-review"},{"abstract":"By Rachel FrittsMay. 10, 2019 , 5:15 PM, Our reliance on sand is staggering—by volume, the amount we use is second only to water. As a key component of cement, asphalt, and glass, sand is integral to every aspect of our lives. It is in our phones, our schools, our hospitals, and our roads. Globally, humans consume up to 50 billion metric tons of sand and gravel every year, amounting to 18 kilograms per person per day., But our insatiable demand for sand now poses “one of the major sustainability challenges of the 21st century,” and meeting it will require “improved governance of global sand resources,” concludes a United Nations report released this week. In particular, the report recommends encouraging ways of reducing demand for new sand and strengthening policies aimed at discouraging the harmful environmental impacts of sand mining. It also recommends developing a more traceable sand supply chain through better monitoring and international information sharing., The U.N. recommendations are “very timely,” says geologist Minik Rosing of the University of Copenhagen, because sand “is a natural resource that transcends national borders, and … extraction frequently has consequences beyond national borders.”, The report represents the first global effort to recommend solutions to sand-related problems, says environmental scientist Pascal Peduzzi, an author of the report and director of GRID-Geneva, a part of the United Nations’s Science Division based in Châtelaine, Switzerland. He became aware of the issue after a trip to investigate beach erosion in Jamaica, he says. “We went to a small fishing village, and the villagers told us that one night some people came with trucks, armed with guns, and they stole their beach away,” Peduzzi recalls. “I was shocked that just for sand, people were ready to kill.”, In 2014, Peduzzi wrote a U.N. report titled Sand: rarer than one thinks that focused on sand extraction’s environmental impact. “But at the time, I had limited solutions to offer,” he says. Then, in October 2018, the United Nations organized a roundtable discussion in Geneva, Switzerland, at which researchers, policy experts, and industry representatives discussed both the scope of the problem and potential solutions., Demand for sand is rising, the report notes. In Asia and Africa, a construction boom has increased demand threefold over the past 2 decades. Globally, extraction of sand and gravel is projected to rise to 82 billion metric tons by 2060. Abundant desert sand, however, is too smooth to use for building materials, so most sand is sourced from quarries. Increasingly, it is also mined from coastal beaches and dredged from fragile river and marine ecosystems, causing harm to aquifers, fisheries and protected areas. And rising prices have prompted “sand mafias” that illegally exploit sand resources to appear in countries such as India and Morocco., Extraction—both legal and illegal—“comes at the expense of other economic sectors, local livelihoods, and biodiversity,” according to the report. And “growth in the extraction and use of these minerals is putting strain on the resource base and will likely lead to a ‘tragedy of the sand commons’ unless a more responsible appropriation of these resources is promoted,” says Aurora Torres, an ecologist at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig., To avoid that tragedy, the world should focus on “reducing natural sand extraction and its impacts in the near term,” the report states. One recommendation is to eliminate unnecessary building projects and speculative building. When building new structures is necessary, recycling old materials is a good option, particularly for developed countries that already have a lot of infrastructure, the report says. Germany, for instance, recycles 87% of its waste aggregate materials. Recycled ash from burned solid waste can also replace sand., When new sand is needed, it should come from stable quarries, if possible, and not aquatic ecosystems. And to ensure that users know their sand is coming from less damaging sources, governments and businesses should create supply chains and regulatory structures that trace sand from its source to the final buyer., Such recommendations are a good start, Torres says. But the issue is still “understudied” and “rarely” comes up in scientific circles, she says. “Hopefully this report will contribute to paving the way for more dialogue, interaction, and collaboration between all the sectors and actors connected by sand flows. It is time to treat sand like a resource, on a par with clean air, biodiversity, and other natural endowments that nations seek to manage for the future.”, The report, which was circulated to policymakers at the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi in March, has already resulted in a new U.N. resolution that calls for sustainable sand management practices., Meanwhile, some nations are eyeing the potential to exploit new sand resources. In Greenland, melting ice is expected to deposit piles of sand on the coast, where it could be exported. Greenland could be a promising source, Rosing says, because “the environmental consequences are likely to be low, governance standards are high, and there will be likely co-benefits for indigenous people.”","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/3072317592_fcaf891700_o.jpg?itok=NLo2WkTw","title":"The world needs to get serious about managing sand, U.N. report says","authors":"Rachel Fritts","pub_date":"May. 10, 2019 , 5:15 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/world-needs-get-serious-about-managing-sand-says-un-report"},{"abstract":"Dog cognition and social behavior have hogged the scientific limelight for years—showing in study after study that canines have social skills essential to their relationships with people.

First, a massive El Niño event hit the coral reef researcher’s 22-year study site, warming the ocean to record levels and killing 85% of the reefs. During her first scuba dive afterward, “I was crying in my mask,” says Cobb, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. It’s one thing to read papers about coral bleaching, but when it happens to a place where “you know every dive like the back of your hand, it’s something different.” Then, a few months later, her hope for government action to tackle climate change was extinguished when Donald Trump was elected U.S. president., So, she started to do a rigorous accounting of the carbon that she’s responsible for emitting, finding that air travel accounted for a whopping 85% of her carbon footprint in 2017. She’d flown roughly 200,000 kilometers that year, mostly to conferences. She vowed that 2018 would be different. “Flying is a luxury and a privilege that must be reserved for a fraction of the events that we use it for right now,” she argues., Cobb is one of a small but growing minority of academics who are cutting back on their air travel because of climate change. Traveling to conferences, lectures, workshops, and the like—frequently by plane—is often viewed as crucial for scientists to exchange information and build community. But Cobb and others are questioning that perspective—pushing conferences to provide more opportunities to participate remotely and changing their personal behavior to do their part in confronting the climate change crisis. On a website called No Fly Climate Sci, for example, roughly 200 academics—many of them climate scientists—have pledged to fly as little as possible since the effort started in 2017., Cobb, for her part, started to ask conference and institutional representatives who invited her to speak whether she could do so remotely; about three-quarters of the time, they agreed. When the answer was no, she declined the invitation. That approach brought Cobb’s 2018 air travel down by 75%, and she plans to continue the practice. “It has been incredibly rewarding,” she says—“a really positive change.”, Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who started No Fly Climate Sci, acknowledges that “most of our colleagues think that we’re a little odd for flying less.” He hopes the site helps like-minded scientists “feel like we’re a little bit of a community.” Kalmus began to limit his air travel as a postdoc in 2011 after he switched from studying astrophysics to studying the Earth’s atmosphere and calculated that three-quarters of his carbon footprint in 2010 came from flying., In 2012, he made a more dramatic change after flying to Europe to meet with collaborators. On the way there, “I had this strong feeling that I didn’t belong on the plane, but the doors were already shut.” He has opted for ground transportation ever since. He didn’t vow never to get on a plane, but since 2012, he has not felt he needed to. Instead, Kalmus often coordinates conference attendance with an annual train trip from California to Illinois to visit family. Many of his meetings and collaborators are also in California, which lessens his need to fly., As Kalmus sees it, it’s not just about reducing his own footprint; it’s also about setting an example. “It’s inevitable that the public looks to us [climate scientists] to gauge the urgency of the situation,” he says. If you’re “walking the talk” then the public will see you as a more trusted messenger of the urgency of climate change., Others disagree with that approach. Cobb says that senior scientists have told her the “flying less movement” is harmful because it distracts from the message that global emissions can only be reined in through collective government action. Still others support the movement but have no choice but to take planes for work. Chandni Singh, a climate adaptation researcher at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements in Bengaluru, added her name to the No Fly Climate Sci website after noticing that most of the profiles were written by European and U.S. academics. In Europe, she often hears colleagues say “‘I came by train’ or ‘I cycled from France to Germany’ or something like that.” But that’s just not possible as a researcher in the Southern Hemisphere who needs to attend meetings in Europe and North America, she says., Reducing air travel can also be a disproportionate sacrifice for junior scientists, who benefit from networking and sharing their work at conferences. Nadir Jeevanjee, a postdoctoral researcher studying atmospheric physics at Princeton University, recently signed up on No Fly Climate Sci and has started to limit his air travel when possible. He’ll be taking an all-day train trip to a conference later this year and recently inquired about giving a virtual talk for a meeting in the United Kingdom. But he says some air travel may be unavoidable. “If you’re an early-career researcher and you’re traveling very little, I think it’s hard to build awareness of your work,” he says. “You have to be standing around at the coffee break to chat, and you can’t do that if you’re not there.”, Cobb agrees. Early-career researchers “should have unfettered … access to flying to build their careers just as I did,” she says. It’s the senior, more established scientists—such as herself—who should curtail air travel, she says. That could make the biggest dent in the problem, too: A study published online last month calculated that, at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, full professors are responsible for three times as many flight-related emissions as grad students and postdocs.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/planetakeoff.jpg?itok=PLRWOBCi","title":"Why some climate scientists are saying no to flying","authors":"Katie Langin","pub_date":"May. 13, 2019 , 1:05 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/why-some-climate-scientists-are-saying-no-flying"},{"abstract":"Strange and noisy objects like a fan with streamers often frighten cats. But they can calm down by picking up on humans' emotional cues, as Kitty does with a smiling Kristyn Vitale., By David GrimmMay. 9, 2019 , 2:00 PM, CORVALLIS, OREGON—Carl the cat was born to beat the odds. Abandoned on the side of the road in a Rubbermaid container, the scrawny black kitten—with white paws, white chest, and a white, skunklike stripe down his nose—was rescued by Kristyn Vitale, a postdoc at Oregon State University here who just happens to study the feline mind. Now, Vitale hopes Carl will pull off another coup, by performing a feat of social smarts researchers once thought was impossible., In a stark white laboratory room, Vitale sits against the back wall, flanked by two overturned cardboard bowls. An undergraduate research assistant kneels a couple of meters away, holding Carl firmly., \"Carl!\" Vitale calls, and then points to one of the bowls. The assistant lets go., Toddlers pass this test easily. They know that when we point at something, we're telling them to look at it—an insight into the intentions of others that will become essential as children learn to interact with people around them. Most other animals, including our closest living relative, chimpanzees, fail the experiment. But about 20 years ago, researchers discovered something surprising: Dogs pass the test with flying colors. The finding shook the scientific community and led to an explosion of studies into the canine mind., Cats like Carl were supposed to be a contrast. Like dogs, cats have lived with us in close quarters for thousands of years. But unlike our canine pals, cats descend from antisocial ancestors, and humans have spent far less time aggressively molding them into companions. So researchers thought cats couldn't possibly share our brain waves the way dogs do., Yet, as cats are apt to do, Carl defies the best-laid plans of Homo sapiens. He trots right over to the bowl Vitale is pointing at, passing the test as easily as his canine rivals. \"Good boy!\" Vitale coos., Carl isn't alone. After years when scientists largely ignored social intelligence in cats, labs studying feline social cognition have popped up around the globe, and a small but growing number of studies is showing that cats match dogs in many tests of social smarts. The work could transform the widespread image of cats as aloof or untamed. It also may eventually offer insight into how domestication transformed wild animals into our best friends, and even hint at how the human mind itself changed over the course of evolution., That is, if the cats themselves deign to participate., Carl's canine predecessor was a black Labrador retriever named Oreo. In the spring of 1996, Brian Hare, then an undergrad at Emory University in Atlanta, was studying how toddlers pass the pointing test. \"I turned to my adviser,\" says Hare, now an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, \"and said, ‘I think my dog can do that.’\", In 1998, Hare and Ádám Miklósi, a cognitive ethologist at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, independently published studies showing dogs could understand human pointing. Until then, social cognition researchers had paid little attention to dogs, thinking their minds had been \"corrupted\" by thousands of years of domestication., Hare's and Miklósi's finding sparked a canine cognition revolution, helping confirm that domesticated animals such as dogs were worthy of study. More than a dozen labs around the world have since churned out hundreds of papers on the canine mind. Researchers have learned that dogs can recognize emotion in people's faces, understand components of human speech, and may even have a sense of fairness and ethics. Those abilities probably helped turn canines into loyal, trusted companions and enabled them to perform socially complex tasks, as varied as guiding the blind and serving with military units., As dogs nuzzled their way up the cognitive tree, however, cats were left clawing at the roots. By 2004, researchers had published more than two dozen papers on canine social cognition—and none on felines. And yet, aside from dogs, no other animal is as prevalent or cherished in the human home. \"The scientific output doesn't match the popularity of cats,\" Miklósi says. \"We know more about how wolves think.\", Miklósi himself tried to change that in 2005. In the first study to directly compare how cats and dogs communicate with people, he and colleagues conducted the pointing test at pet owners' homes. The cats performed as well as the dogs. But, foreshadowing a headache that would plague the field of feline social cognition, several cats \"dropped out\" of the study, according to the research paper. Some stopped paying attention. Others simply walked away from the testing site., What should have been the beginning of a revolution in feline social cognition turned out to be a dead end. No one followed up on Miklósi's study, including Miklósi himself, who vowed never to work with cats again. \"I think everybody tried, and almost everybody gave up,\" he says, laughing. It would be nearly a decade before almost anyone tried again., Back at Oregon State, a heavy-set calico named Lyla has entered the white lab room along with her owner, Clara. As we watch on a video feed, Lyla slinks low to the ground and suddenly freezes—eyes dilated—when a door slams in the adjoining hallway. Then things get worse: Clara leaves. Lyla begins to circle, seemingly in a panic, and then creeps toward the door where Clara exited. Then Lyla meows. And meows. And meows., \"Our record is 61 cries in 2 minutes,\" says Vitale, who runs the cat research program here. After 2 minutes, Clara returns to the room and sits cross-legged on the floor. Lyla immediately walks over and rubs against her owner's legs and face while Clara strokes her. Then, calmer than she's been since she arrived, Lyla walks away from Clara and begins to explore the room, sniffing its corners and batting a feather toy., \"People think that's a sign the cat doesn't care about the owner,\" Vitale says. \"But it's actually the opposite.\" Lyla, she says, is showing that she trusts Clara so much that she feels comfortable going off on her own as long as Clara is around. In essence, Clara is her security blanket., To find out whether your cat can pass some common tests of social intelligence, try these simplified experiments at home. Make sure your cat is calm and relaxed before you start., Vitale grew up with cats and, like Miklósi, wondered why no one had bothered to study their social mind. \"There was a void in the research world I was drawn to,\" she says. \"I saw the projects that could be done.\" She came to Oregon State as a graduate student in 2014 to work with Monique Udell, an animal behaviorist who had published studies on dogs, wolves, and even bats., Vitale was well prepared to add cats to the lab's repertoire. She has four at home, and at Oregon State she began to run kitten classes for the community, teaching cats to socialize with strangers and other felines and even walk on a leash. That experience came in handy for acclimating the animals to the alien environment of the laboratory. (Vitale's tricks include coaxing cats into the experimental room by leading them with a feather dangling from a plastic rod, and she wears a fanny pack loaded with five kinds of treats.), In 2017, Vitale and Udell showed that cats preferred interacting with people over food and toys. This year, the team reported that cats spend more time with humans who pay attention to them—such as by clicking at them and calling their name. Similar behavior in dogs has been used to argue that canines are tuned in to our \"attentional state,\" allowing them to pick up on our gestures, commands, and other social cues. Vitale is also exploring whether cats that have \"passed\" her kitten class are more attached to their owners or more sensitive to human emotions—a skill Lyla is about to demonstrate., Vitale enters the white lab room and places a fan taped with black and white streamers on the floor. Then, she turns it on and leaves. As the streamers shoot out from the fan and crackle against each other, Lyla crawls back to Clara and circles her, as though looking for reassurance. Then, as previously instructed by Vitale, Clara begins to make friends with the fan. \"What a nice fan,\" she murmurs soothingly to the object. And then, to Lyla, \"Don't you want to see the fan?\" Remarkably, Lyla approaches the fan and lies down next to it. \"She's picking up on Clara's positive state of mind,\" Vitale says., Few species understand what human pointing means, but Lyla aces the test (top)—assuming she’s paying attention., Similar work, published by Italian researchers in 2015, was the first to show that cats, like dogs, can shape their behavior to human emotions—something many pet owners may have suspected but that hadn't been scientifically demonstrated. The Italian group also found that most of the cats looked back and forth between the fan and their owner, as though trying to suss out how they should respond to the object., Meanwhile, ethologist Péter Pongrácz, a colleague of Miklósi's at Eötvös Loránd, has taken the pointing test to the next level. Instead of using fingers, members of his team simply gazed at an object, sometimes just for a split second. Cats followed the gaze 70% of the time, the group reported late last year, similar to the performance of dogs., Most animals rarely gaze at each other, and when they do it's often a sign of hostility, Pongrácz says. To see cats use gaze the way people do—to share information—is \"really surprising,\" he says. \"The findings provide stronger proof that cats have evolved to be capable of complex communication with humans.\", The discovery also impresses Christian Nawroth, a behavioral biologist who studies social cognition in livestock at the Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology in Dummerstorf, Germany. He has shown that pigs can follow pointing, but only with lots of training, and that they struggle to follow gaze. \"The performance rates of cats really surprised me,\" he says. \"We haven't seen that with farm animals.\", It's true that many cats won't pass social intelligence tests as well as dogs, Miklósi says. But that's likely because they're in an unfamiliar environment or with unfamiliar people, which can stress them out. What's important, he says, is that some cats can pass the tests, suggesting these abilities are inherent to the species. \"If you take a well-socialized, calm cat, I think it's going to perform similarly to a dog.\", Additional studies on cats are happening in labs from Mexico to Japan. Researchers are showing that cats perceive some optical illusions the same way we do and that they can distinguish their owners' voices from those of strangers. \"The field is definitely expanding,\" Vitale says. \"Cats are finally getting their due.\", But when it comes to catching up with dogs, cats may turn out to be their own worst enemy., A few years back, Pongrácz brought a cat into his lab for a study. \"In less than a minute, it escaped and got into an air duct,\" he says. \"We were terrified. We had to wait an hour for it to come out.\", Things didn't go much better with his gaze experiments. Pongrácz's team did the work in cats' homes, thinking they would be better behaved there, but some felines either didn't cooperate or dived under the sofa. Other cats—frustrated by being held when they knew the researchers had treats—scratched and wriggled their way out of their owners' arms. \"It's like suddenly the cat has 10 legs,\" Pongrácz says., The team started with 99 cats but got usable data on only 41. In other labs, cats have leapt out of mazes topped with nets designed to keep them inside, leaving the whole setup in disarray. And some researchers have had to deprive cats of food for up to 8 hours just to motivate them to crave a treat. \"If you want results on one cat,\" Miklósi says, \"you have to test three.\", Those stats concern Alex Taylor, a comparative psychologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who has studied cognition in crows, dogs, and other animals. \"There's a lot of solid science going on in these cat studies, but it's taking a lot of resources to produce the data,\" he says. \"It would give me pause about working with cats.\", Research money is also scarce. Pongrácz funded the gaze study out of his own pocket. And Atsuko Saito, a psychologist at Sophia University in Tokyo who just last month showed that cats seem to know their names even when a stranger says them, says she can't get grants either., Kristyn Vitale with her cat Carl. New research suggests cats are more socially bonded to humans than many people had suspected., Even Vitale is struggling. Her postdoc funding ends in October, and though she has grant applications out, she's worried that the work, lacking direct applications to people, won't win support from funding agencies such as the National Institutes of Health. \"If I leave,\" she says, \"pretty much everything I do would leave with me.\", Yet even the limited work on cats so far could help unravel some of the mysteries of how we bonded so closely with our pets. Dogs and cats traveled different roads to the human home: Dogs evolved from the social, cooperative gray wolf and are the product of thousands of years of intensive breeding and selection by humans. Cats, by contrast, descend from the fiercely antisocial and territorial Near Eastern wildcat, and they largely domesticated themselves, as the tamest cats began to hang out and hunt rodents in early farming villages. Both species seem to have evolved the same skills to live alongside us, however, suggesting those skills are crucial to domestication., Reading complex human cues such as gaze may have allowed cats and dogs to communicate with people in a way other animals can't. And puppies and kittens seem to pick up those skills right away, whereas animals such as wolves can take months to understand something even simpler, such as pointing., Still, Nawroth and Taylor say it's too early to tell whether the social intelligence of cats and dogs is more advanced than that of other domesticated animals. If we shared our beds with pigs, they might be just as good at following the human gaze. And Hare argues that to truly understand what has changed in the feline mind through evolution, researchers will need to compare cats with their direct ancestors—for example, by exploring how the wildcat responds to social cues from humans and other cats., Such work could give us a fresh insight into another domesticated species: humans. Like cats, our ancestors may have self-domesticated, becoming less aggressive and more cooperative over evolutionary time. \"It would be interesting to see if the things that changed in cats also changed in us,\" Nawroth says., Udell wonders whether one such trait was our ability to live alongside other species, the way cats and dogs have evolved to live alongside us. \"Maybe it's not just cats and dogs that have become more socially flexible,\" she says. \"Perhaps we have as well.\", As Vitale finishes her work with Lyla, a research assistant brings in her own cat, a gray and brown striped tabby named Moody. His name turns out to be appropriate. In the lab, he first encounters a person who plays with him and then one who ignores him. He quickly learns to approach the friendly person and avoid the indifferent one. Then Vitale enters the room. Will she play with him or brush him off? Moody apparently assumes the latter, keeping his distance. \"That's a sign of pessimism,\" she says., Vitale herself is cautiously optimistic. She recognizes the challenges of working with cats, but she hopes scientists see the potential, too. \"Cats are now where dogs were a couple of decades ago,\" she says. \"I hope researchers give them a chance to show what they can do.\", There's a very widespread belief that cats are stupid and selfish. The new results are pushing back on that., Despite his reservations about working with cats, Taylor thinks the field will grow. Having owners bring pets into a lab is much easier than housing other species yourself, he says. \"We're moving from the rat and pigeon phase of comparative psychology to the dog and cat phase.\", Vitale hopes the new findings will help workers make shelter cats more adoptable—they often lack the social skills of their house cat counterparts—and lead to improved ways to calm separation anxiety and other social disorders in felines., And both she and Pongrácz think the research will help dispel negative perceptions about cats. When it comes to social skills, \"There's a very widespread belief that cats are stupid and selfish,\" Pongrácz says. \"The new results are pushing back on that.\", Meanwhile, Miklósi has returned to the feline fold. For example, he's considering using touch screens to see whether cats can categorize objects such as landscapes and animals, as dogs can. \"I've been working with dogs for 25 years. It's getting harder and harder to find something new and exciting to do with them,\" he says. \"Cats are still exciting. Maybe it's the time of the cat.\"","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ca_0510NF_Cat_Cognition_Fan_1280x720.jpg?itok=kD2kQQBu","title":"Cats rival dogs on many tests of social smarts.

But fish that ply the sea at depths greater than sunlight can penetrate have developed super-vision, highly attuned to the faint glow and twinkle given off by other creatures. They owe this power, evolutionary biologists have learned, to an extraordinary increase in the number of genes for rod opsins, retinal proteins that detect dim light. Those extra genes have diversified to produce proteins capable of capturing every possible photon at multiple wavelengths—which could mean that despite the darkness, the fish roaming the deep ocean actually see in color., The finding \"really shakes up the dogma of deep-sea vision,\" says Megan Porter, an evolutionary biologist studying vision at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu who was not involved in the work. Researchers had observed that the deeper a fish lives, the simpler its visual system is, a trend they assumed would continue to the bottom. \"That [the deepest dwellers] have all these opsins means there's a lot more complexity in the interplay between light and evolution in the deep sea than we realized,\" Porter says., At a depth of 1000 meters, the last glimmer of sunlight is gone. But over the past 15 years, researchers have realized that the depths are pervaded by a faint bioluminescence from flashing shrimp, octopus, bacteria, and even fish. Most vertebrate eyes could barely detect this subtle shimmer. To learn how fish can see it, a team led by evolutionary biologist Walter Salzburger from the University of Basel in Switzerland studied deep-sea fishes' opsin proteins. Variation in the opsins' amino acid sequences changes the wavelength of light detected, so multiple opsins make color vision possible. One opsin, RH1, works well in low light. Found in the eye's rod cells, it enables humans to see in the dark—but only in black and white., Salzburger and his colleagues searched for opsin genes in 101 fish species, including seven Atlantic Ocean deep-sea fish whose genomes they fully sequenced. Most fish have one or two RH1 opsins, like many other vertebrates, but four of the deep-sea species stood apart, the researchers report this week in Science. Those fish—the lantern-fish, a tube-eye fish, and two spinyfins—all had at least five RH1 genes, and one, the silver spinyfin (Diretmus argenteus), had 38. \"This is unheard of in vertebrate vision,\" says K. Kristian Donner, a sensory biologist at the University of Helsinki., To make sure the extra genes weren't just nonfunctional duplicates, the team measured gene activity in 36 species, including specimens of 11 deep-sea fish. Multiple RH1 genes were active in the deep-sea species, and the total was 14 in an adult silver spinyfin, which thrives down to 2000 meters. \"At first it seems paradoxical—this is where there's the least amount of light,\" Salzburger says., The retina of the silver spinyfin (Diretmus argenteus) has an unusual arrangement of low light–sensing rod cells, which house diverse photoreceptor proteins (right). Some of the rod layers are stacked to best capture the few photons available below a depth of 1000 meters., Researchers can predict the wavelengths that an opsin protein is most sensitive to from its amino acid sequence. The deep-sea fish had a total of 24 mutations that alter the function of their RH1 proteins, fine-tuning each to see a narrow range of blue and green wavelengths—the colors of bioluminescence. \"Some of these opsins might be tuned to detect particular bioluminescent signals associated with food, danger, or social interactions,\" says Gil Rosenthal, a behavioral ecologist at Texas A&M University in College Station., The four deep-sea species belong to three different branches of the fish family tree, indicating that this supervision evolved repeatedly. \"This indicates that animals living in extreme light environments may be subject to extreme natural selective pressures to improve visual performance,\" says Eric Warrant, a visual ecologist at Lund University in Sweden., The bountiful opsins also help explain the unusual anatomy of the spinyfin retina. Some of its rod cells are much longer than usual, and many are stacked one on top of another rather than arranged in a single layer. The enlarged cells and the stacking help ensure more incoming photons are detected, but researchers have long assumed these rods all had the same opsin. Now, it appears that, like the layers in old photographic film, rods of different sizes might capture different wavelengths of light. \"We now have to accept that our view [of deep-sea vision] has been too limited,\" Donner says., Because of the depths these fish inhabit, it's impossible to collect live specimens to test their vision. But the multiple rod opsins may enable them to distinguish color, Salzburger and others agree. For these fish, the faint bioluminescence in the inky depths could be as vivid and varied as the bright surface world.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/aav4632_Cover-Possibility_seq3_v1_online_only.jpg?itok=Elq1JAAK","title":"In the deep, dark, ocean fish have evolved superpowered vision","authors":"Elizabeth Pennisi","pub_date":"May. 9, 2019 , 2:00 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/deep-dark-ocean-fish-have-evolved-superpowered-vision"},{"abstract":"By Rachel FrittsMay. 10, 2019 , 5:11 PM, Our reliance on sand is staggering—by volume, the amount we use is second only to water. As a key component of cement, asphalt, and glass, sand is integral to every aspect of our lives. It is in our phones, our schools, our hospitals, and our roads. Globally, humans consume up to 50 billion metric tons of sand and gravel every year, amounting to 18 kilograms per person per day., But our insatiable demand for sand now poses “one of the major sustainability challenges of the 21stcentury,\" and meeting it will require “improved governance of global sand resources,” concludes a United Nations (UN) report released this week. In particular, the report recommends encouraging ways of reducing demand for new sand and strengthening policies aimed at discouraging the harmful environmental impacts of sand mining. It also recommends developing a more traceable sand supply chain through better monitoring and international information sharing., The UN recommendations are “very timely,” says geologist Minik Rosing of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, because sand “is a natural resource that transcends national borders, and… extraction frequently has consequences beyond national borders.”, The report represents the first global effort to recommend solutions to sand-related problems, says environmental scientist Pascal Peduzzi, an author of the report and director of GRID-Geneva, a part of the UN’s Science Division based in Châtelaine, Switzerland. He became aware of the issue after a trip to investigate beach erosion in Jamaica, he says. “We went to a small fishing village, and the villagers told us that one night some people came with trucks, armed with guns, and they stole their beach away,” Peduzzi recalls. “I was shocked that just for sand, people were ready to kill.”, In 2014, Peduzzi wrote a UN report titled, “Sand: rarer than one thinks,” that focused on sand extraction’s environmental impact. “But at the time, I had limited solutions to offer,” he says. Then, in October 2018, the UN organized a roundtable discussion in Geneva, Switzerland, at which researchers, policy experts, and industry representatives discussed both the scope of the problem and potential solutions., Demand for sand is rising, the report notes. In Asia and Africa, a construction boom has increased demand three-fold over the past two decades. Globally, extraction of sand and gravel is projected to rise to 82 billion metric tons by 2060. Abundant desert sand, however, is too smooth to use for building materials, so most sand is sourced from quarries. Increasingly, it is also mined from coastal beaches and dredged from fragile river and marine ecosystems, causing harm to aquifers, fisheries and protected areas. And rising prices have prompted “sand mafias” that illegally exploit sand resources to appear in countries such as India and Morocco., Extraction—both legal and illegal—“comes at the expense of other economic sectors, local livelihoods and biodiversity,” according to the report. And “growth in the extraction and use of these minerals is putting strain on the resource base and will likely lead to a ‘tragedy of the sand commons’ unless a more responsible appropriation of these resources is promoted,” says Aurora Torres, an ecologist at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig., To avoid that tragedy, the world should focus on “reducing natural sand extraction and its impacts in the near term,” the report states. One recommendation is to eliminate unnecessary building projects and speculative building. When building new structures is necessary, recycling old materials is a good option, particularly for developed countries that already have a lot of infrastructure, the report says. Germany, for instance, recycles 87 percent of its waste aggregate materials. Recycled ash from burned solid waste can also replace sand., When new sand is needed, it should come from stable quarries, if possible, and not aquatic ecosystems. And to ensure that users know their sand is coming from less damaging sources, governments and businesses should create supply chains and regulatory structures that trace sand from its source to the final buyer., Such recommendations are a good start, says Torres. But the issue is still “understudied” and “rarely” comes up in scientific circles, she says. “Hopefully this report will contribute to paving the way for more dialogue, interaction, and collaboration between all the sectors and actors connected by sand flows. It is time to treat sand like a resource, on a par with clean air, biodiversity, and other natural endowments that nations seek to manage for the future.”, The report, which was circulated to policymakers at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya this past March, has already resulted in a new UN resolution that calls for sustainable sand management practices., Meanwhile, some nations are eyeing the potential to exploit new sand resources. In Greenland, melting ice is expected to deposit piles of sand on the coast, where it could be exported. Greenland could be a promising source, says Rosing, because “the environmental consequences are likely to be low, governance standards are high, and there will be likely co-benefits for indigenous people.”","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/3072317592_fcaf891700_o.jpg?itok=NLo2WkTw","title":"The world needs to get serious about managing sand, says UN report","authors":"Rachel Fritts","pub_date":"May. 10, 2019 , 5:11 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/world-needs-get-serious-about-managing-sand-says-un-report"},{"abstract":"By Matthew HutsonMay. 10, 2019 , 3:20 PM, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA—Computers can master some tasks—like playing a game of Go—through trial and error. But what works for a game doesn’t work for risky real-world tasks like driving a car, where “losing” might involve a high-speed collision. To drive safely, humans have an exquisite feedback system: our fight-or-flight response, in which physiological reactions like a rapid heart rate and sweaty palms signal “fear,” and so keep us vigilant and, theoretically, out of trouble. Now, researchers at Microsoft are giving artificial intelligence (AI) programs a rough analog of anxiety to help them sense when they’re pushing their luck., The scientists placed sensors on people’s fingers to record pulse amplitude while they were in a driving simulator, as a measure of arousal. An algorithm used those recordings—80 minutes divided among four people—to learn to predict an average person’s pulse amplitude at each moment on the course. It then used those “fear” signals as a guide while learning to drive through the virtual world: If a human would be scared here, it might muse, “I’m doing something wrong.” AIs using this method still had to crash to learn safe driving skills, but they required 25% fewer crashes to reach the same level of performance as a nonfearful AI, the researchers reported this week at the International Conference on Learning Representations here., The researchers wondered whether this kind of arousal was just a rough proxy for distance to walls, so they trained another AI to drive using wall proximity instead of fear. But fear proved more useful, likely because it encodes a richer set of expectations, including the feeling of turning too rapidly, the paper hypothesizes., Emotions help humans learn and make decisions, and researchers say this paper is a proof of concept that giving AIs viscerallike responses can bring their abilities closer to our own. It also suggests another application: training autonomous vehicles to avoid driving in a way that makes passengers uncomfortable or car sick, even if it’s safe.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/driving_16x9.jpg?itok=oVFyM9WE","title":"Scientists teach computers fear—to make them better drivers","authors":"Matthew Hutson","pub_date":"May. 10, 2019 , 3:20 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/scientists-teach-computers-fear-make-them-better-drivers"},{"abstract":"Dog cognition and social behavior have hogged the scientific limelight for years—showing in study after study that canines have social skills essential to their relationships with people.

Online News Editor David Grimm joins host Sarah Crespi to discuss several brave research labs that have started to work with cats on their terms in order to show they have social smarts comparable to dogs.

But they can calm down by picking up on humans' emotional cues, as Kitty does with a smiling Kristyn Vitale., By David GrimmMay. 9, 2019 , 2:00 PM, CORVALLIS, OREGON—Carl the cat was born to beat the odds. Abandoned on the side of the road in a Rubbermaid container, the scrawny black kitten—with white paws, white chest, and a white, skunklike stripe down his nose—was rescued by Kristyn Vitale, a postdoc at Oregon State University here who just happens to study the feline mind. Now, Vitale hopes Carl will pull off another coup, by performing a feat of social smarts researchers once thought was impossible., In a stark white laboratory room, Vitale sits against the back wall, flanked by two overturned cardboard bowls. An undergraduate research assistant kneels a couple of meters away, holding Carl firmly., \"Carl!\" Vitale calls, and then points to one of the bowls. The assistant lets go., Toddlers pass this test easily. They know that when we point at something, we're telling them to look at it—an insight into the intentions of others that will become essential as children learn to interact with people around them. Most other animals, including our closest living relative, chimpanzees, fail the experiment. But about 20 years ago, researchers discovered something surprising: Dogs pass the test with flying colors. The finding shook the scientific community and led to an explosion of studies into the canine mind., Cats like Carl were supposed to be a contrast. Like dogs, cats have lived with us in close quarters for thousands of years. But unlike our canine pals, cats descend from antisocial ancestors, and humans have spent far less time aggressively molding them into companions. So researchers thought cats couldn't possibly share our brain waves the way dogs do., Yet, as cats are apt to do, Carl defies the best-laid plans of Homo sapiens. He trots right over to the bowl Vitale is pointing at, passing the test as easily as his canine rivals. \"Good boy!\" Vitale coos., Carl isn't alone. After years when scientists largely ignored social intelligence in cats, labs studying feline social cognition have popped up around the globe, and a small but growing number of studies is showing that cats match dogs in many tests of social smarts. The work could transform the widespread image of cats as aloof or untamed. It also may eventually offer insight into how domestication transformed wild animals into our best friends, and even hint at how the human mind itself changed over the course of evolution., That is, if the cats themselves deign to participate., Carl's canine predecessor was a black Labrador retriever named Oreo. In the spring of 1996, Brian Hare, then an undergrad at Emory University in Atlanta, was studying how toddlers pass the pointing test. \"I turned to my adviser,\" says Hare, now an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, \"and said, ‘I think my dog can do that.’\", In 1998, Hare and Ádám Miklósi, a cognitive ethologist at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, independently published studies showing dogs could understand human pointing. Until then, social cognition researchers had paid little attention to dogs, thinking their minds had been \"corrupted\" by thousands of years of domestication., Hare's and Miklósi's finding sparked a canine cognition revolution, helping confirm that domesticated animals such as dogs were worthy of study. More than a dozen labs around the world have since churned out hundreds of papers on the canine mind. Researchers have learned that dogs can recognize emotion in people's faces, understand components of human speech, and may even have a sense of fairness and ethics. Those abilities probably helped turn canines into loyal, trusted companions and enabled them to perform socially complex tasks, as varied as guiding the blind and serving with military units., As dogs nuzzled their way up the cognitive tree, however, cats were left clawing at the roots. By 2004, researchers had published more than two dozen papers on canine social cognition—and none on felines. And yet, aside from dogs, no other animal is as prevalent or cherished in the human home. \"The scientific output doesn't match the popularity of cats,\" Miklósi says. \"We know more about how wolves think.\", Miklósi himself tried to change that in 2005. In the first study to directly compare how cats and dogs communicate with people, he and colleagues conducted the pointing test at pet owners' homes. The cats performed as well as the dogs. But, foreshadowing a headache that would plague the field of feline social cognition, several cats \"dropped out\" of the study, according to the research paper. Some stopped paying attention. Others simply walked away from the testing site., What should have been the beginning of a revolution in feline social cognition turned out to be a dead end. No one followed up on Miklósi's study, including Miklósi himself, who vowed never to work with cats again. \"I think everybody tried, and almost everybody gave up,\" he says, laughing. It would be nearly a decade before almost anyone tried again., Back at Oregon State, a heavy-set calico named Lyla has entered the white lab room along with her owner, Clara. As we watch on a video feed, Lyla slinks low to the ground and suddenly freezes—eyes dilated—when a door slams in the adjoining hallway. Then things get worse: Clara leaves. Lyla begins to circle, seemingly in a panic, and then creeps toward the door where Clara exited. Then Lyla meows. And meows. And meows., \"Our record is 61 cries in 2 minutes,\" says Vitale, who runs the cat research program here. After 2 minutes, Clara returns to the room and sits cross-legged on the floor. Lyla immediately walks over and rubs against her owner's legs and face while Clara strokes her. Then, calmer than she's been since she arrived, Lyla walks away from Clara and begins to explore the room, sniffing its corners and batting a feather toy., \"People think that's a sign the cat doesn't care about the owner,\" Vitale says. \"But it's actually the opposite.\" Lyla, she says, is showing that she trusts Clara so much that she feels comfortable going off on her own as long as Clara is around. In essence, Clara is her security blanket., To find out whether your cat can pass some common tests of social intelligence, try these simplified experiments at home. Make sure your cat is calm and relaxed before you start., Vitale grew up with cats and, like Miklósi, wondered why no one had bothered to study their social mind. \"There was a void in the research world I was drawn to,\" she says. \"I saw the projects that could be done.\" She came to Oregon State as a graduate student in 2014 to work with Monique Udell, an animal behaviorist who had published studies on dogs, wolves, and even bats., Vitale was well prepared to add cats to the lab's repertoire. She has four at home, and at Oregon State she began to run kitten classes for the community, teaching cats to socialize with strangers and other felines and even walk on a leash. That experience came in handy for acclimating the animals to the alien environment of the laboratory. (Vitale's tricks include coaxing cats into the experimental room by leading them with a feather dangling from a plastic rod, and she wears a fanny pack loaded with five kinds of treats.), In 2017, Vitale and Udell showed that cats preferred interacting with people over food and toys. This year, the team reported that cats spend more time with humans who pay attention to them—such as by clicking at them and calling their name. Similar behavior in dogs has been used to argue that canines are tuned in to our \"attentional state,\" allowing them to pick up on our gestures, commands, and other social cues. Vitale is also exploring whether cats that have \"passed\" her kitten class are more attached to their owners or more sensitive to human emotions—a skill Lyla is about to demonstrate., Vitale enters the white lab room and places a fan taped with black and white streamers on the floor. Then, she turns it on and leaves. As the streamers shoot out from the fan and crackle against each other, Lyla crawls back to Clara and circles her, as though looking for reassurance. Then, as previously instructed by Vitale, Clara begins to make friends with the fan. \"What a nice fan,\" she murmurs soothingly to the object. And then, to Lyla, \"Don't you want to see the fan?\" Remarkably, Lyla approaches the fan and lies down next to it. \"She's picking up on Clara's positive state of mind,\" Vitale says., Few species understand what human pointing means, but Lyla aces the test (top)—assuming she’s paying attention., Similar work, published by Italian researchers in 2015, was the first to show that cats, like dogs, can shape their behavior to human emotions—something many pet owners may have suspected but that hadn't been scientifically demonstrated. The Italian group also found that most of the cats looked back and forth between the fan and their owner, as though trying to suss out how they should respond to the object., Meanwhile, ethologist Péter Pongrácz, a colleague of Miklósi's at Eötvös Loránd, has taken the pointing test to the next level. Instead of using fingers, members of his team simply gazed at an object, sometimes just for a split second. Cats followed the gaze 70% of the time, the group reported late last year, similar to the performance of dogs., Most animals rarely gaze at each other, and when they do it's often a sign of hostility, Pongrácz says. To see cats use gaze the way people do—to share information—is \"really surprising,\" he says. \"The findings provide stronger proof that cats have evolved to be capable of complex communication with humans.\", The discovery also impresses Christian Nawroth, a behavioral biologist who studies social cognition in livestock at the Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology in Dummerstorf, Germany. He has shown that pigs can follow pointing, but only with lots of training, and that they struggle to follow gaze. \"The performance rates of cats really surprised me,\" he says. \"We haven't seen that with farm animals.\", It's true that many cats won't pass social intelligence tests as well as dogs, Miklósi says. But that's likely because they're in an unfamiliar environment or with unfamiliar people, which can stress them out. What's important, he says, is that some cats can pass the tests, suggesting these abilities are inherent to the species. \"If you take a well-socialized, calm cat, I think it's going to perform similarly to a dog.\", Additional studies on cats are happening in labs from Mexico to Japan. Researchers are showing that cats perceive some optical illusions the same way we do and that they can distinguish their owners' voices from those of strangers. \"The field is definitely expanding,\" Vitale says. \"Cats are finally getting their due.\", But when it comes to catching up with dogs, cats may turn out to be their own worst enemy., A few years back, Pongrácz brought a cat into his lab for a study. \"In less than a minute, it escaped and got into an air duct,\" he says. \"We were terrified. We had to wait an hour for it to come out.\", Things didn't go much better with his gaze experiments. Pongrácz's team did the work in cats' homes, thinking they would be better behaved there, but some felines either didn't cooperate or dived under the sofa. Other cats—frustrated by being held when they knew the researchers had treats—scratched and wriggled their way out of their owners' arms. \"It's like suddenly the cat has 10 legs,\" Pongrácz says., The team started with 99 cats but got usable data on only 41. In other labs, cats have leapt out of mazes topped with nets designed to keep them inside, leaving the whole setup in disarray. And some researchers have had to deprive cats of food for up to 8 hours just to motivate them to crave a treat. \"If you want results on one cat,\" Miklósi says, \"you have to test three.\", Those stats concern Alex Taylor, a comparative psychologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who has studied cognition in crows, dogs, and other animals. \"There's a lot of solid science going on in these cat studies, but it's taking a lot of resources to produce the data,\" he says. \"It would give me pause about working with cats.\", Research money is also scarce. Pongrácz funded the gaze study out of his own pocket. And Atsuko Saito, a psychologist at Sophia University in Tokyo who just last month showed that cats seem to know their names even when a stranger says them, says she can't get grants either., Kristyn Vitale with her cat Carl. New research suggests cats are more socially bonded to humans than many people had suspected., Even Vitale is struggling. Her postdoc funding ends in October, and though she has grant applications out, she's worried that the work, lacking direct applications to people, won't win support from funding agencies such as the National Institutes of Health. \"If I leave,\" she says, \"pretty much everything I do would leave with me.\", Yet even the limited work on cats so far could help unravel some of the mysteries of how we bonded so closely with our pets. Dogs and cats traveled different roads to the human home: Dogs evolved from the social, cooperative gray wolf and are the product of thousands of years of intensive breeding and selection by humans. Cats, by contrast, descend from the fiercely antisocial and territorial Near Eastern wildcat, and they largely domesticated themselves, as the tamest cats began to hang out and hunt rodents in early farming villages. Both species seem to have evolved the same skills to live alongside us, however, suggesting those skills are crucial to domestication., Reading complex human cues such as gaze may have allowed cats and dogs to communicate with people in a way other animals can't. And puppies and kittens seem to pick up those skills right away, whereas animals such as wolves can take months to understand something even simpler, such as pointing., Still, Nawroth and Taylor say it's too early to tell whether the social intelligence of cats and dogs is more advanced than that of other domesticated animals. If we shared our beds with pigs, they might be just as good at following the human gaze. And Hare argues that to truly understand what has changed in the feline mind through evolution, researchers will need to compare cats with their direct ancestors—for example, by exploring how the wildcat responds to social cues from humans and other cats., Such work could give us a fresh insight into another domesticated species: humans. Like cats, our ancestors may have self-domesticated, becoming less aggressive and more cooperative over evolutionary time. \"It would be interesting to see if the things that changed in cats also changed in us,\" Nawroth says., Udell wonders whether one such trait was our ability to live alongside other species, the way cats and dogs have evolved to live alongside us. \"Maybe it's not just cats and dogs that have become more socially flexible,\" she says. \"Perhaps we have as well.\", As Vitale finishes her work with Lyla, a research assistant brings in her own cat, a gray and brown striped tabby named Moody. His name turns out to be appropriate. In the lab, he first encounters a person who plays with him and then one who ignores him. He quickly learns to approach the friendly person and avoid the indifferent one. Then Vitale enters the room. Will she play with him or brush him off? Moody apparently assumes the latter, keeping his distance. \"That's a sign of pessimism,\" she says., Vitale herself is cautiously optimistic. She recognizes the challenges of working with cats, but she hopes scientists see the potential, too. \"Cats are now where dogs were a couple of decades ago,\" she says. \"I hope researchers give them a chance to show what they can do.\", There's a very widespread belief that cats are stupid and selfish. The new results are pushing back on that., Despite his reservations about working with cats, Taylor thinks the field will grow. Having owners bring pets into a lab is much easier than housing other species yourself, he says. \"We're moving from the rat and pigeon phase of comparative psychology to the dog and cat phase.\", Vitale hopes the new findings will help workers make shelter cats more adoptable—they often lack the social skills of their house cat counterparts—and lead to improved ways to calm separation anxiety and other social disorders in felines., And both she and Pongrácz think the research will help dispel negative perceptions about cats. When it comes to social skills, \"There's a very widespread belief that cats are stupid and selfish,\" Pongrácz says. \"The new results are pushing back on that.\", Meanwhile, Miklósi has returned to the feline fold. For example, he's considering using touch screens to see whether cats can categorize objects such as landscapes and animals, as dogs can. \"I've been working with dogs for 25 years. It's getting harder and harder to find something new and exciting to do with them,\" he says. \"Cats are still exciting. Maybe it's the time of the cat.\"","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ca_0510NF_Cat_Cognition_Fan_1280x720.jpg?itok=kD2kQQBu","title":"Cats rival dogs on many tests of social smarts.

The nitrogen-rich feces enrich the soil and create hot spots with lots of biological diversity that can extend more than 1000 meters beyond the borders of penguin and seal colonies, according to a new study., Scientists trekked through fields of waste created by elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and Antarctic penguins, including gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), chinstrap (P. antarcticus, pictured), and Adélie penguins (P. adeliae). The team examined the soil and plants surrounding these colonies at three separate locations along the Antarctic peninsula. Where there are more seals and penguins—and more of their poop—there was more biodiversity in the land, the researchers report today in Current Biology., The feces partially evaporate as ammonia, which then can get blown more than 1000 meters inland by the wind and is absorbed into the soil, the scientists note. This ammonia then creates a cycle of nutrient enrichment: The nitrogen is consumed by plants and lichens, which in turn support an incredible number of invertebrates, including mites, springtails, and roundworms. In fact, the team identified millions of invertebrates per square meter of soil surrounding the seal and penguin colonies—up to eight times higher than the number found in other parts of the peninsula., These findings offer scientists a stronger understanding of how life can thrive in the coldest place on Earth. Now, the big question is whether these biodiversity hot spots will create perfect breeding grounds for something else: invasive plant species that can threaten the future of these environments.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/penguin_16x9_1.jpg?itok=-CGRA0bf","title":"Life thrives in Antarctic hot spots created by seal and penguin poop","authors":"Helen Santoro","pub_date":"May. 9, 2019 , 11:00 AM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/life-thrives-antarctic-hot-spots-created-seal-and-penguin-poop"},{"abstract":"He Jiankui speaks at a 2018 conference in Hong Kong, China, where he gave a public account of creating the first gene-edited human babies., By Jon CohenMay. 8, 2019 , 2:25 PM, Four prominent Chinese bioethicists have published an unusually frank and critical assessment of their country’s handling of biomedical research in the wake of what they refer to as the “CRISPR babies’ scandal.”, Their commentary, published online today in Nature, calls for “an overhaul” in the way the biomedical experiments in China are regulated, monitored, and registered and for “severe” penalties for researchers who violate regulations. “China is at a crossroads,” write Ruipeng Lei of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, Xiaomei Zhai of Peking Union Medical College in Beijing, Wei Zhu of Fudan University in Shanghai, and Renzong Qiu of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. “The government must make substantial changes to protect others from the potential effects of reckless human experimentation.”, The authors say a “soul searching” is now taking place in China because of the November 2018 revelation that He Jiankui, a biophysicist at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, had created the world’s first babies, twin girls, who had genes edited while they were embryos. He, who was subsequently fired from his job and has not spoken publicly since he described the germline editing experiment at a Hong Kong, China, meeting, used CRISPR—which cuts DNA—to cripple a cell surface protein that HIV uses to infect cells. The intent, he said, was to “genetically vaccinate” the girls so that they would not be susceptible to the virus., In the Nature commentary, the authors criticize He for his secrecy and the country for creating an environment that encouraged him. “In our view, researchers in China are increasingly motivated by the promise of fame and fortune, rather than by a genuine desire for discovery,” they write. “And transferring devices or approaches to the clinic is not always backed by solid basic research. Moreover, researchers who can declare that they are the first to discover something, both in Asia and in the world, are disproportionately rewarded when it comes to peer review, hiring decisions and funding.”, Bioethicists outside China are impressed by the editorial. “I think it’s rather remarkable that they published this in such a prominent place,” says Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison who is on an expert committee convened by the World Health Organization to assess how to better regulate germline editing. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York City, said he “admired” the article and thought it was “courageous” for his Chinese colleagues to speak so bluntly. “They’re getting into things that haven’t been said by others in China, so that’s very good.”, The four authors contend that scientific research should be governed by the State Council, China’s cabinet, rather than the collection of government ministries that now do oversight, a system they say “is fragmented and hampered by staff incompetence or resistance.” They also urged their country to confront “the eugenic thinking that has persisted among a small proportion of Chinese scholars.”, As for He, who was strongly criticized in preliminary findings made public by a Chinese government-controlled news outlet in January from an investigation run by the Guangdong Health Commission (the province where he worked), the bioethicists suggest the government conduct a more extensive inquiry. They recommend that “a committee of internationally renowned experts in gene editing assess the data resulting from He’s work” and also offer a blueprint for monitoring the health of the twin girls for their entire lives., Science corresponded by email with Qui about the investigations surrounding He’s controversial experiment. This is an edited version of that exchange., Q: Xinhua, China’s official news agency, described the initial He inquiry as a “preliminary investigation,” which suggests it was either not complete or that there was at least another investigation underway. Do you know?, A: Nothing suggests another investigation is underway. So, we suggest a further, more extensive inquiry is needed., Q: In the United States, western European countries, Australia, and Japan, a misconduct investigation of a scientist almost always leads to a thorough report that is made public. There has been nothing issued by the Guangdong Health Commission―nothing more than a press release given only to Xinhua—and your commentary did not call for any future report to be made public. Do you think these reports should be made public?, A: Of course, I think such reports should be made public. There seem to be no rules on whether and how to report the findings of investigations on cases of violating regulations. My colleagues and I have suggested to build a central registry on genome editing which is open access to the public. The registry could also be a platform where findings of investigations on cases of violating regulations are published., Q: Have any of you been asked to help with any investigations of He?, A: Immediately after the news was broke, the National Health Commission asked Xiaomei Zhai to go to Shenzhen to investigate the case―along with some commission officials. Zhai couldn’t go because she had to attend the Hong Kong summit. There were two occasions where I was invited by government think tanks to provide advice on He’s case. I suggested the government should make thorough investigation―especially any involvement of government officials and He’s colleagues and collaborators (both in China and the U.S.), including personnel at the IVF [in vitro fertilization] clinics―because He could not be the only person responsible for the incident. It’s unclear if any government officials were involved in the He incident in any way. But He certainly had ties with some governmental officials as his work on third-generation genome sequencing was prominently featured in a state television channel., Q: Your editorial calls for “rebooting” ethics governance. If any government officials or government-funded institutions supported or indicated approval of He’s germline editing in any way, are you confident that the Guangdong Health Commission’s investigation or any other investigation led by a government agency would transparently report this?, A: Sorry, I am afraid I am not in a position to answer this question. There has been no transparency regarding who the members of the investigation team are, which procedures they have followed, or what they have found. In general, I favor that the government puts together investigation teams that consist of independent experts. I don’t know if more investigation results will be disclosed, but I think the world deserves to know the truth. And I don’t think we can properly move on or prevent similar incidents from happening again until we know exactly what has happened., I don’t believe the government per se is involved. I have some contact with deputy ministry of National Health Commission and some officials at its Department of Science and Education, and I think they are not only honest persons, but also hold the view like our bioethicists in compliance with international guidelines. In many cases, they accepted our suggestions on drafting or revising relevant regulations. However, I cannot exclude some governmental officials in some departments at different levels being involved in it., Q: Do you think independence of the investigatory team is important? Is it possible in China?, A: For a bioethicist like me and many other scholars in China, that’s a given. Of course, the investigation should be both independent and transparent. I think it’s possible if China realizes the gravity of the matter. How China deals with it will determine the reputation and the future of the country and its scientific and bioethics communities.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/He_16x9_0.jpg?itok=dkW9lWyO","title":"Chinese bioethicists call for ‘reboot’ of biomedical regulation after country’s gene-edited baby scandal","authors":"Jon Cohen","pub_date":"May. 8, 2019 , 2:25 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/chinese-bioethicists-call-reboot-biomedical-regulation-after-country-s-gene-edited-baby"},{"abstract":"A Samsung Galaxy Note 7 after its lithium-ion battery caught fire, By Robert F. ServiceMay. 8, 2019 , 2:10 PM, Lithium-ion batteries power everything from laptops to lawn mowers. But they can ignite when damaged because they rely on flammable components. Now, researchers report they’ve redesigned these batteries to work with nonflammable materials. As a bonus, the new batteries might even store more power than current models., The work is “absolutely remarkable progress,” says Gleb Yushin, a materials scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, who was not involved with the research. If commercialized, the new batteries could help keep drivers of electric vehicles safe even if they wind up in an accident., Lithium-ion batteries contain three main components: two charge-storing electrodes and a liquid organic electrolyte that separate them. The electrolyte ferries lithium ions back and forth between the electrodes during charging and discharging, but they’re flammable., In recent years, researchers have experimented with replacing these organic electrolytes with solid electrolytes or water-based versions that can’t catch fire. But if the operating voltage of these water-based batteries exceeds 1.23 volts (V)—below that of even a 1.5-V AA battery—electrode materials can react with water molecules, splitting them into hydrogen and oxygen gases, often with explosive results. Yet when researchers stay below the 1.23-V threshold, they end up with batteries that store far less energy than traditional lithium-ion cells, which operate at about 4 V., Hope for an alternative arose in 2015, when researchers led by Chunsheng Wang, a materials scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park, reported they created a novel salt-rich water-based electrolyte. This water-in-salt electrolyte (WiSE) promotes the formation a protective solid shield around the electrodes that prevented them from ripping apart water molecules in the electrolyte’s interior. But the electrode materials in those batteries could only muster 3 V., Prospects brightened in 2017, when Wang and colleagues reported they had come up with a positively charged electrode, or anode, material that was compatible with 4-V operation and worked with the WiSE. That just left them to address the negatively charged electrode, or cathode., Now, Wang and his colleagues have done just that. They report today in Nature that they’ve come up with a graphite-based cathode that works with the WiSE at 4 V and above. The new electrode material includes bromine and chlorine, and it ends up protected from the water-based electrolyte by locking reactive electrode materials in solid salt particles around the electrode. The battery starts with lithium bound up in solid lithium-bromine and lithium-chloride salt particles surrounding a graphite electrode made up of layers of carbon atoms. When the battery charges, bromine and chlorine atoms ditch their lithium partners, give up electrons to the cathode, and wedge themselves between graphite’s carbon layers, forming another nice tight solid. The voltage difference between the two electrodes then drives the positively charged lithium ions through the water-based electrolyte to the anode, where they meet up with electrons provided by an external circuit., When the battery discharges during use, the lithium ions give up those electrons and reverse course to the cathode. The electrons travel back through the external circuit to the cathode, where bromine and chlorine atoms grab them and end up with a negative charge. This charge causes them to diffuse back out of the graphite. The lithium ions then snag them, reforming the solid salt particles that stay put until the next round of charging., Wang and his colleagues note that gram for gram, their cathode materials already have about 30% greater charge storage capacity than conventional cathode materials. But it remains to be seen whether the full batteries, including the new electrolyte, will end up holding more energy than commercial versions., Even if they don’t, the new WiSE batteries would not require cobalt, a toxic metal in conventional lithium-ion cathodes. Cobalt mining has been tied to widespread deaths of miners—often children—in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the rare metal is relatively abundant. That would make the batteries safer for not only consumers, but miners and the environment as well.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/phone_16x9.jpg?itok=--cDARI5","title":"New generation of lithium-ion batteries could hold more charge—without catching fire","authors":"Robert F.

The All of Us study run by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, has recruited 143,000 participants who have already taken surveys and visited a clinic to give blood and urine samples. Another 87,000 have at least registered for the study., Study leaders say these numbers give them confidence All of Us will reach 1 million participants within 5 or 6 years—although they will need to ramp up enrollment to reach that goal. And they expect to broaden the study’s geographic distribution, which so far largely covers just a few states., Announced by then-President Barack Obama 4 years ago, the All of Us study, which could cost $4 billion over 10 years, aims to enroll a diverse swath of U.S. inhabitants—citizens or not—who agree to share their health records and DNA on an anonymized basis. Researchers will use the data to develop “precision medicine,” or personalized treatments for others—the study participants themselves can request their genetic data but won’t receive medical help as part of the project. The 143,000 people who have given consent, taken surveys, and visited a clinic for physical measurements and to give blood and urine samples meet All of Us’s original diversity goal: Fifty-three percent are ethnic or racial minorities, far more than the 39% these groups constitute in the U.S. population. (For example, participants with self-identified African ancestry constitute 20% of the study, compared with 13% in the population.), And 80% are from groups All of Us has defined as “underrepresented in biomedical research.” That includes gay people, rural dwellers, the elderly, and those who are disabled or don’t have good access to medical care. In just its first year, “All of Us has managed to become one of largest, most diverse research resources in history,” said NIH Director Francis Collins at a 6 May event marking the study’s anniversary., The enrollment figures are not quite as rosy as they initially appear. For one thing, NIH had already enrolled 20% of the total before May 2018 during pilot testing. And some people who sign up online will never show up at a clinic to fully participate, says NIH’s Eric Dishman, director of All of Us. However, he expects enrollment to reach 4000 people a week by next fall—on track for 1 million within 6 years—as the study adds more sites. The pace will also pick up when the study eventually begins to enroll children., To speed things up, Dishman’s staff members are tweaking the study’s original plans. For example, the health provider organizations (HPOs) enrolling many participants can now include people who don’t get health care through that HPO. And a pilot project will soon send 13,000 saliva kits to people who sign up online or by phone through the study’s “direct enrollment” process. Study staff can then quickly test these volunteers’ DNA for disease-associated markers, then later have them visit a clinic to give blood for fuller genome sequencing., All of Us has also unveiled a “research hub” that holds pooled health and survey data for participants. (A “workbench” where approved researchers can work with the full data set will go online next winter.) The data show that more than two-thirds of fully enrolled participants come from just six states with participating HPOs, with 19% of participants from Arizona (which has 2% of the U.S. population). Dishman says Arizona surged ahead because it had effective “techniques and methods” for recruiting. Although the study won’t attempt to represent the U.S. population’s geographic diversity, the distribution will even out as more volunteers join the study via direct enrollment, which could end up including half of all participants, he says., Overall, Dishman is not worried about reaching 1 million volunteers. “What I am worried about is retaining 1 million,” or keeping people from dropping out during the study’s 10-year span, he says. All of Us plans to work on that by holding community events in key cities to “gin up excitement about the program and pull people through,” he says.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/all%20of%20us_16x9.jpg?itok=WsXngMnr","title":"NIH says its 1-million-person health study is off to good start","authors":"Jocelyn Kaiser","pub_date":"May. 8, 2019 , 5:15 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/nih-says-its-1-million-person-health-study-good-start"},{"abstract":"Living in the gloom 2000 meters down, the silver spinyfin may see color., By Elizabeth PennisiMay. 9, 2019 , 2:00 PM, When the ancestors of cave fish and certain crickets moved into pitchblack caverns, their eyes virtually disappeared over generations. But fish that ply the sea at depths greater than sunlight can penetrate have developed super-vision, highly attuned to the faint glow and twinkle given off by other creatures. They owe this power, evolutionary biologists have learned, to an extraordinary increase in the number of genes for rod opsins, retinal proteins that detect dim light. Those extra genes have diversified to produce proteins capable of capturing every possible photon at multiple wavelengths—which could mean that despite the darkness, the fish roaming the deep ocean actually see in color., The finding \"really shakes up the dogma of deep-sea vision,\" says Megan Porter, an evolutionary biologist studying vision at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu who was not involved in the work. Researchers had observed that the deeper a fish lives, the simpler its visual system is, a trend they assumed would continue to the bottom. \"That [the deepest dwellers] have all these opsins means there's a lot more complexity in the interplay between light and evolution in the deep sea than we realized,\" Porter says., At a depth of 1000 meters, the last glimmer of sunlight is gone. But over the past 15 years, researchers have realized that the depths are pervaded by a faint bioluminescence from flashing shrimp, octopus, bacteria, and even fish. Most vertebrate eyes could barely detect this subtle shimmer. To learn how fish can see it, a team led by evolutionary biologist Walter Salzburger from the University of Basel in Switzerland studied deep-sea fishes' opsin proteins. Variation in the opsins' amino acid sequences changes the wavelength of light detected, so multiple opsins make color vision possible. One opsin, RH1, works well in low light. Found in the eye's rod cells, it enables humans to see in the dark—but only in black and white., Salzburger and his colleagues searched for opsin genes in 101 fish species, including seven Atlantic Ocean deep-sea fish whose genomes they fully sequenced. Most fish have one or two RH1 opsins, like many other vertebrates, but four of the deep-sea species stood apart, the researchers report this week in Science. Those fish—the lantern-fish, a tube-eye fish, and two spinyfins—all had at least five RH1 genes, and one, the silver spinyfin (Diretmus argenteus), had 38. \"This is unheard of in vertebrate vision,\" says K. Kristian Donner, a sensory biologist at the University of Helsinki., To make sure the extra genes weren't just nonfunctional duplicates, the team measured gene activity in 36 species, including specimens of 11 deep-sea fish. Multiple RH1 genes were active in the deep-sea species, and the total was 14 in an adult silver spinyfin, which thrives down to 2000 meters. \"At first it seems paradoxical—this is where there's the least amount of light,\" Salzburger says., The retina of the silver spinyfin (Diretmus argenteus) has an unusual arrangement of low light–sensing rod cells, which house diverse photoreceptor proteins (right). Some of the rod layers are stacked to best capture the few photons available below a depth of 1000 meters., Researchers can predict the wavelengths that an opsin protein is most sensitive to from its amino acid sequence. The deep-sea fish had a total of 24 mutations that alter the function of their RH1 proteins, fine-tuning each to see a narrow range of blue and green wavelengths—the colors of bioluminescence. \"Some of these opsins might be tuned to detect particular bioluminescent signals associated with food, danger, or social interactions,\" says Gil Rosenthal, a behavioral ecologist at Texas A&M University in College Station., The four deep-sea species belong to three different branches of the fish family tree, indicating that this supervision evolved repeatedly. \"This indicates that animals living in extreme light environments may be subject to extreme natural selective pressures to improve visual performance,\" says Eric Warrant, a visual ecologist at Lund University in Sweden., The bountiful opsins also help explain the unusual anatomy of the spinyfin retina. Some of its rod cells are much longer than usual, and many are stacked one on top of another rather than arranged in a single layer. The enlarged cells and the stacking help ensure more incoming photons are detected, but researchers have long assumed these rods all had the same opsin. Now, it appears that, like the layers in old photographic film, rods of different sizes might capture different wavelengths of light. \"We now have to accept that our view [of deep-sea vision] has been too limited,\" Donner says., Because of the depths these fish inhabit, it's impossible to collect live specimens to test their vision. But the multiple rod opsins may enable them to distinguish color, Salzburger and others agree. For these fish, the faint bioluminescence in the inky depths could be as vivid and varied as the bright surface world.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/aav4632_Cover-Possibility_seq3_v1_online_only.jpg?itok=Elq1JAAK","title":"In the deep, dark, ocean fish have evolved superpowered vision","authors":"Elizabeth Pennisi","pub_date":"May. 9, 2019 , 2:00 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/deep-dark-ocean-fish-have-evolved-superpowered-vision"},{"abstract":"By Rachel FrittsMay. 10, 2019 , 5:11 PM, Our reliance on sand is staggering—by volume, the amount we use is second only to water. As a key component of cement, asphalt, and glass, sand is integral to every aspect of our lives. It is in our phones, our schools, our hospitals, and our roads. Globally, humans consume up to 50 billion metric tons of sand and gravel every year, amounting to 18 kilograms per person per day., But our insatiable demand for sand now poses “one of the major sustainability challenges of the 21stcentury,\" and meeting it will require “improved governance of global sand resources,” concludes a United Nations (UN) report released this week. In particular, the report recommends encouraging ways of reducing demand for new sand and strengthening policies aimed at discouraging the harmful environmental impacts of sand mining. It also recommends developing a more traceable sand supply chain through better monitoring and international information sharing., The UN recommendations are “very timely,” says geologist Minik Rosing of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, because sand “is a natural resource that transcends national borders, and… extraction frequently has consequences beyond national borders.”, The report represents the first global effort to recommend solutions to sand-related problems, says environmental scientist Pascal Peduzzi, an author of the report and director of GRID-Geneva, a part of the UN’s Science Division based in Châtelaine, Switzerland. He became aware of the issue after a trip to investigate beach erosion in Jamaica, he says. “We went to a small fishing village, and the villagers told us that one night some people came with trucks, armed with guns, and they stole their beach away,” Peduzzi recalls. “I was shocked that just for sand, people were ready to kill.”, In 2014, Peduzzi wrote a UN report titled, “Sand: rarer than one thinks,” that focused on sand extraction’s environmental impact. “But at the time, I had limited solutions to offer,” he says. Then, in October 2018, the UN organized a roundtable discussion in Geneva, Switzerland, at which researchers, policy experts, and industry representatives discussed both the scope of the problem and potential solutions., Demand for sand is rising, the report notes. In Asia and Africa, a construction boom has increased demand three-fold over the past two decades. Globally, extraction of sand and gravel is projected to rise to 82 billion metric tons by 2060. Abundant desert sand, however, is too smooth to use for building materials, so most sand is sourced from quarries. Increasingly, it is also mined from coastal beaches and dredged from fragile river and marine ecosystems, causing harm to aquifers, fisheries and protected areas. And rising prices have prompted “sand mafias” that illegally exploit sand resources to appear in countries such as India and Morocco., Extraction—both legal and illegal—“comes at the expense of other economic sectors, local livelihoods and biodiversity,” according to the report. And “growth in the extraction and use of these minerals is putting strain on the resource base and will likely lead to a ‘tragedy of the sand commons’ unless a more responsible appropriation of these resources is promoted,” says Aurora Torres, an ecologist at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig., To avoid that tragedy, the world should focus on “reducing natural sand extraction and its impacts in the near term,” the report states. One recommendation is to eliminate unnecessary building projects and speculative building. When building new structures is necessary, recycling old materials is a good option, particularly for developed countries that already have a lot of infrastructure, the report says. Germany, for instance, recycles 87 percent of its waste aggregate materials. Recycled ash from burned solid waste can also replace sand., When new sand is needed, it should come from stable quarries, if possible, and not aquatic ecosystems. And to ensure that users know their sand is coming from less damaging sources, governments and businesses should create supply chains and regulatory structures that trace sand from its source to the final buyer., Such recommendations are a good start, says Torres. But the issue is still “understudied” and “rarely” comes up in scientific circles, she says. “Hopefully this report will contribute to paving the way for more dialogue, interaction, and collaboration between all the sectors and actors connected by sand flows. It is time to treat sand like a resource, on a par with clean air, biodiversity, and other natural endowments that nations seek to manage for the future.”, The report, which was circulated to policymakers at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya this past March, has already resulted in a new UN resolution that calls for sustainable sand management practices., Meanwhile, some nations are eyeing the potential to exploit new sand resources. In Greenland, melting ice is expected to deposit piles of sand on the coast, where it could be exported. Greenland could be a promising source, says Rosing, because “the environmental consequences are likely to be low, governance standards are high, and there will be likely co-benefits for indigenous people.”","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/3072317592_fcaf891700_o.jpg?itok=NLo2WkTw","title":"The world needs to get serious about managing sand, says UN report","authors":"Rachel Fritts","pub_date":"May. 10, 2019 , 5:11 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/world-needs-get-serious-about-managing-sand-says-un-report"},{"abstract":"By Matthew HutsonMay. 10, 2019 , 3:20 PM, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA—Computers can master some tasks—like playing a game of Go—through trial and error. But what works for a game doesn’t work for risky real-world tasks like driving a car, where “losing” might involve a high-speed collision. To drive safely, humans have an exquisite feedback system: our fight-or-flight response, in which physiological reactions like a rapid heart rate and sweaty palms signal “fear,” and so keep us vigilant and, theoretically, out of trouble. Now, researchers at Microsoft are giving artificial intelligence (AI) programs a rough analog of anxiety to help them sense when they’re pushing their luck., The scientists placed sensors on people’s fingers to record pulse amplitude while they were in a driving simulator, as a measure of arousal. An algorithm used those recordings—80 minutes divided among four people—to learn to predict an average person’s pulse amplitude at each moment on the course. It then used those “fear” signals as a guide while learning to drive through the virtual world: If a human would be scared here, it might muse, “I’m doing something wrong.” AIs using this method still had to crash to learn safe driving skills, but they required 25% fewer crashes to reach the same level of performance as a nonfearful AI, the researchers reported this week at the International Conference on Learning Representations here., The researchers wondered whether this kind of arousal was just a rough proxy for distance to walls, so they trained another AI to drive using wall proximity instead of fear. But fear proved more useful, likely because it encodes a richer set of expectations, including the feeling of turning too rapidly, the paper hypothesizes., Emotions help humans learn and make decisions, and researchers say this paper is a proof of concept that giving AIs viscerallike responses can bring their abilities closer to our own. It also suggests another application: training autonomous vehicles to avoid driving in a way that makes passengers uncomfortable or car sick, even if it’s safe.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/driving_16x9.jpg?itok=oVFyM9WE","title":"Scientists teach computers fear—to make them better drivers","authors":"Matthew Hutson","pub_date":"May. 10, 2019 , 3:20 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/scientists-teach-computers-fear-make-them-better-drivers"},{"abstract":"By Alex FoxMay. 10, 2019 , 4:45 PM, Archaeologists find richest cache of ancient mind-altering drugs in South America, Researchers have discovered a 1000-year-old bag containing the most varied combination of psychoactive compounds found at an ancient South American site, including cocaine and the primary ingredients in a hallucinogenic tea called ayahuasca.

But they can calm down by picking up on humans' emotional cues, as Kitty does with a smiling Kristyn Vitale., By David GrimmMay. 9, 2019 , 2:00 PM, CORVALLIS, OREGON—Carl the cat was born to beat the odds. Abandoned on the side of the road in a Rubbermaid container, the scrawny black kitten—with white paws, white chest, and a white, skunklike stripe down his nose—was rescued by Kristyn Vitale, a postdoc at Oregon State University here who just happens to study the feline mind. Now, Vitale hopes Carl will pull off another coup, by performing a feat of social smarts researchers once thought was impossible., In a stark white laboratory room, Vitale sits against the back wall, flanked by two overturned cardboard bowls. An undergraduate research assistant kneels a couple of meters away, holding Carl firmly., \"Carl!\" Vitale calls, and then points to one of the bowls. The assistant lets go., Toddlers pass this test easily. They know that when we point at something, we're telling them to look at it—an insight into the intentions of others that will become essential as children learn to interact with people around them. Most other animals, including our closest living relative, chimpanzees, fail the experiment. But about 20 years ago, researchers discovered something surprising: Dogs pass the test with flying colors. The finding shook the scientific community and led to an explosion of studies into the canine mind., Cats like Carl were supposed to be a contrast. Like dogs, cats have lived with us in close quarters for thousands of years. But unlike our canine pals, cats descend from antisocial ancestors, and humans have spent far less time aggressively molding them into companions. So researchers thought cats couldn't possibly share our brain waves the way dogs do., Yet, as cats are apt to do, Carl defies the best-laid plans of Homo sapiens. He trots right over to the bowl Vitale is pointing at, passing the test as easily as his canine rivals. \"Good boy!\" Vitale coos., Carl isn't alone. After years when scientists largely ignored social intelligence in cats, labs studying feline social cognition have popped up around the globe, and a small but growing number of studies is showing that cats match dogs in many tests of social smarts. The work could transform the widespread image of cats as aloof or untamed. It also may eventually offer insight into how domestication transformed wild animals into our best friends, and even hint at how the human mind itself changed over the course of evolution., That is, if the cats themselves deign to participate., Carl's canine predecessor was a black Labrador retriever named Oreo. In the spring of 1996, Brian Hare, then an undergrad at Emory University in Atlanta, was studying how toddlers pass the pointing test. \"I turned to my adviser,\" says Hare, now an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, \"and said, ‘I think my dog can do that.’\", In 1998, Hare and Ádám Miklósi, a cognitive ethologist at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, independently published studies showing dogs could understand human pointing. Until then, social cognition researchers had paid little attention to dogs, thinking their minds had been \"corrupted\" by thousands of years of domestication., Hare's and Miklósi's finding sparked a canine cognition revolution, helping confirm that domesticated animals such as dogs were worthy of study. More than a dozen labs around the world have since churned out hundreds of papers on the canine mind. Researchers have learned that dogs can recognize emotion in people's faces, understand components of human speech, and may even have a sense of fairness and ethics. Those abilities probably helped turn canines into loyal, trusted companions and enabled them to perform socially complex tasks, as varied as guiding the blind and serving with military units., As dogs nuzzled their way up the cognitive tree, however, cats were left clawing at the roots. By 2004, researchers had published more than two dozen papers on canine social cognition—and none on felines. And yet, aside from dogs, no other animal is as prevalent or cherished in the human home. \"The scientific output doesn't match the popularity of cats,\" Miklósi says. \"We know more about how wolves think.\", Miklósi himself tried to change that in 2005. In the first study to directly compare how cats and dogs communicate with people, he and colleagues conducted the pointing test at pet owners' homes. The cats performed as well as the dogs. But, foreshadowing a headache that would plague the field of feline social cognition, several cats \"dropped out\" of the study, according to the research paper. Some stopped paying attention. Others simply walked away from the testing site., What should have been the beginning of a revolution in feline social cognition turned out to be a dead end. No one followed up on Miklósi's study, including Miklósi himself, who vowed never to work with cats again. \"I think everybody tried, and almost everybody gave up,\" he says, laughing. It would be nearly a decade before almost anyone tried again., Back at Oregon State, a heavy-set calico named Lyla has entered the white lab room along with her owner, Clara. As we watch on a video feed, Lyla slinks low to the ground and suddenly freezes—eyes dilated—when a door slams in the adjoining hallway. Then things get worse: Clara leaves. Lyla begins to circle, seemingly in a panic, and then creeps toward the door where Clara exited. Then Lyla meows. And meows. And meows., \"Our record is 61 cries in 2 minutes,\" says Vitale, who runs the cat research program here. After 2 minutes, Clara returns to the room and sits cross-legged on the floor. Lyla immediately walks over and rubs against her owner's legs and face while Clara strokes her. Then, calmer than she's been since she arrived, Lyla walks away from Clara and begins to explore the room, sniffing its corners and batting a feather toy., \"People think that's a sign the cat doesn't care about the owner,\" Vitale says. \"But it's actually the opposite.\" Lyla, she says, is showing that she trusts Clara so much that she feels comfortable going off on her own as long as Clara is around. In essence, Clara is her security blanket., To find out whether your cat can pass some common tests of social intelligence, try these simplified experiments at home. Make sure your cat is calm and relaxed before you start., Vitale grew up with cats and, like Miklósi, wondered why no one had bothered to study their social mind. \"There was a void in the research world I was drawn to,\" she says. \"I saw the projects that could be done.\" She came to Oregon State as a graduate student in 2014 to work with Monique Udell, an animal behaviorist who had published studies on dogs, wolves, and even bats., Vitale was well prepared to add cats to the lab's repertoire. She has four at home, and at Oregon State she began to run kitten classes for the community, teaching cats to socialize with strangers and other felines and even walk on a leash. That experience came in handy for acclimating the animals to the alien environment of the laboratory. (Vitale's tricks include coaxing cats into the experimental room by leading them with a feather dangling from a plastic rod, and she wears a fanny pack loaded with five kinds of treats.), In 2017, Vitale and Udell showed that cats preferred interacting with people over food and toys. This year, the team reported that cats spend more time with humans who pay attention to them—such as by clicking at them and calling their name. Similar behavior in dogs has been used to argue that canines are tuned in to our \"attentional state,\" allowing them to pick up on our gestures, commands, and other social cues. Vitale is also exploring whether cats that have \"passed\" her kitten class are more attached to their owners or more sensitive to human emotions—a skill Lyla is about to demonstrate., Vitale enters the white lab room and places a fan taped with black and white streamers on the floor. Then, she turns it on and leaves. As the streamers shoot out from the fan and crackle against each other, Lyla crawls back to Clara and circles her, as though looking for reassurance. Then, as previously instructed by Vitale, Clara begins to make friends with the fan. \"What a nice fan,\" she murmurs soothingly to the object. And then, to Lyla, \"Don't you want to see the fan?\" Remarkably, Lyla approaches the fan and lies down next to it. \"She's picking up on Clara's positive state of mind,\" Vitale says., Few species understand what human pointing means, but Lyla aces the test (top)—assuming she’s paying attention., Similar work, published by Italian researchers in 2015, was the first to show that cats, like dogs, can shape their behavior to human emotions—something many pet owners may have suspected but that hadn't been scientifically demonstrated. The Italian group also found that most of the cats looked back and forth between the fan and their owner, as though trying to suss out how they should respond to the object., Meanwhile, ethologist Péter Pongrácz, a colleague of Miklósi's at Eötvös Loránd, has taken the pointing test to the next level. Instead of using fingers, members of his team simply gazed at an object, sometimes just for a split second. Cats followed the gaze 70% of the time, the group reported late last year, similar to the performance of dogs., Most animals rarely gaze at each other, and when they do it's often a sign of hostility, Pongrácz says. To see cats use gaze the way people do—to share information—is \"really surprising,\" he says. \"The findings provide stronger proof that cats have evolved to be capable of complex communication with humans.\", The discovery also impresses Christian Nawroth, a behavioral biologist who studies social cognition in livestock at the Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology in Dummerstorf, Germany. He has shown that pigs can follow pointing, but only with lots of training, and that they struggle to follow gaze. \"The performance rates of cats really surprised me,\" he says. \"We haven't seen that with farm animals.\", It's true that many cats won't pass social intelligence tests as well as dogs, Miklósi says. But that's likely because they're in an unfamiliar environment or with unfamiliar people, which can stress them out. What's important, he says, is that some cats can pass the tests, suggesting these abilities are inherent to the species. \"If you take a well-socialized, calm cat, I think it's going to perform similarly to a dog.\", Additional studies on cats are happening in labs from Mexico to Japan. Researchers are showing that cats perceive some optical illusions the same way we do and that they can distinguish their owners' voices from those of strangers. \"The field is definitely expanding,\" Vitale says. \"Cats are finally getting their due.\", But when it comes to catching up with dogs, cats may turn out to be their own worst enemy., A few years back, Pongrácz brought a cat into his lab for a study. \"In less than a minute, it escaped and got into an air duct,\" he says. \"We were terrified. We had to wait an hour for it to come out.\", Things didn't go much better with his gaze experiments. Pongrácz's team did the work in cats' homes, thinking they would be better behaved there, but some felines either didn't cooperate or dived under the sofa. Other cats—frustrated by being held when they knew the researchers had treats—scratched and wriggled their way out of their owners' arms. \"It's like suddenly the cat has 10 legs,\" Pongrácz says., The team started with 99 cats but got usable data on only 41. In other labs, cats have leapt out of mazes topped with nets designed to keep them inside, leaving the whole setup in disarray. And some researchers have had to deprive cats of food for up to 8 hours just to motivate them to crave a treat. \"If you want results on one cat,\" Miklósi says, \"you have to test three.\", Those stats concern Alex Taylor, a comparative psychologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who has studied cognition in crows, dogs, and other animals. \"There's a lot of solid science going on in these cat studies, but it's taking a lot of resources to produce the data,\" he says. \"It would give me pause about working with cats.\", Research money is also scarce. Pongrácz funded the gaze study out of his own pocket. And Atsuko Saito, a psychologist at Sophia University in Tokyo who just last month showed that cats seem to know their names even when a stranger says them, says she can't get grants either., Kristyn Vitale with her cat Carl. New research suggests cats are more socially bonded to humans than many people had suspected., Even Vitale is struggling. Her postdoc funding ends in October, and though she has grant applications out, she's worried that the work, lacking direct applications to people, won't win support from funding agencies such as the National Institutes of Health. \"If I leave,\" she says, \"pretty much everything I do would leave with me.\", Yet even the limited work on cats so far could help unravel some of the mysteries of how we bonded so closely with our pets. Dogs and cats traveled different roads to the human home: Dogs evolved from the social, cooperative gray wolf and are the product of thousands of years of intensive breeding and selection by humans. Cats, by contrast, descend from the fiercely antisocial and territorial Near Eastern wildcat, and they largely domesticated themselves, as the tamest cats began to hang out and hunt rodents in early farming villages. Both species seem to have evolved the same skills to live alongside us, however, suggesting those skills are crucial to domestication., Reading complex human cues such as gaze may have allowed cats and dogs to communicate with people in a way other animals can't. And puppies and kittens seem to pick up those skills right away, whereas animals such as wolves can take months to understand something even simpler, such as pointing., Still, Nawroth and Taylor say it's too early to tell whether the social intelligence of cats and dogs is more advanced than that of other domesticated animals. If we shared our beds with pigs, they might be just as good at following the human gaze. And Hare argues that to truly understand what has changed in the feline mind through evolution, researchers will need to compare cats with their direct ancestors—for example, by exploring how the wildcat responds to social cues from humans and other cats., Such work could give us a fresh insight into another domesticated species: humans. Like cats, our ancestors may have self-domesticated, becoming less aggressive and more cooperative over evolutionary time. \"It would be interesting to see if the things that changed in cats also changed in us,\" Nawroth says., Udell wonders whether one such trait was our ability to live alongside other species, the way cats and dogs have evolved to live alongside us. \"Maybe it's not just cats and dogs that have become more socially flexible,\" she says. \"Perhaps we have as well.\", As Vitale finishes her work with Lyla, a research assistant brings in her own cat, a gray and brown striped tabby named Moody. His name turns out to be appropriate. In the lab, he first encounters a person who plays with him and then one who ignores him. He quickly learns to approach the friendly person and avoid the indifferent one. Then Vitale enters the room. Will she play with him or brush him off? Moody apparently assumes the latter, keeping his distance. \"That's a sign of pessimism,\" she says., Vitale herself is cautiously optimistic. She recognizes the challenges of working with cats, but she hopes scientists see the potential, too. \"Cats are now where dogs were a couple of decades ago,\" she says. \"I hope researchers give them a chance to show what they can do.\", There's a very widespread belief that cats are stupid and selfish. The new results are pushing back on that., Despite his reservations about working with cats, Taylor thinks the field will grow. Having owners bring pets into a lab is much easier than housing other species yourself, he says. \"We're moving from the rat and pigeon phase of comparative psychology to the dog and cat phase.\", Vitale hopes the new findings will help workers make shelter cats more adoptable—they often lack the social skills of their house cat counterparts—and lead to improved ways to calm separation anxiety and other social disorders in felines., And both she and Pongrácz think the research will help dispel negative perceptions about cats. When it comes to social skills, \"There's a very widespread belief that cats are stupid and selfish,\" Pongrácz says. \"The new results are pushing back on that.\", Meanwhile, Miklósi has returned to the feline fold. For example, he's considering using touch screens to see whether cats can categorize objects such as landscapes and animals, as dogs can. \"I've been working with dogs for 25 years. It's getting harder and harder to find something new and exciting to do with them,\" he says. \"Cats are still exciting. Maybe it's the time of the cat.\"","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ca_0510NF_Cat_Cognition_Fan_1280x720.jpg?itok=kD2kQQBu","title":"Cats rival dogs on many tests of social smarts.

The nitrogen-rich feces enrich the soil and create hot spots with lots of biological diversity that can extend more than 1000 meters beyond the borders of penguin and seal colonies, according to a new study., Scientists trekked through fields of waste created by elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and Antarctic penguins, including gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), chinstrap (P. antarcticus, pictured), and Adélie penguins (P. adeliae). The team examined the soil and plants surrounding these colonies at three separate locations along the Antarctic peninsula. Where there are more seals and penguins—and more of their poop—there was more biodiversity in the land, the researchers report today in Current Biology., The feces partially evaporate as ammonia, which then can get blown more than 1000 meters inland by the wind and is absorbed into the soil, the scientists note. This ammonia then creates a cycle of nutrient enrichment: The nitrogen is consumed by plants and lichens, which in turn support an incredible number of invertebrates, including mites, springtails, and roundworms. In fact, the team identified millions of invertebrates per square meter of soil surrounding the seal and penguin colonies—up to eight times higher than the number found in other parts of the peninsula., These findings offer scientists a stronger understanding of how life can thrive in the coldest place on Earth. Now, the big question is whether these biodiversity hot spots will create perfect breeding grounds for something else: invasive plant species that can threaten the future of these environments.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/penguin_16x9_1.jpg?itok=-CGRA0bf","title":"Life thrives in Antarctic hot spots created by seal and penguin poop","authors":"Helen Santoro","pub_date":"May. 9, 2019 , 11:00 AM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/life-thrives-antarctic-hot-spots-created-seal-and-penguin-poop"},{"abstract":"A Samsung Galaxy Note 7 after its lithium-ion battery caught fire, By Robert F. ServiceMay. 8, 2019 , 2:10 PM, Lithium-ion batteries power everything from laptops to lawn mowers. But they can ignite when damaged because they rely on flammable components. Now, researchers report they’ve redesigned these batteries to work with nonflammable materials. As a bonus, the new batteries might even store more power than current models., The work is “absolutely remarkable progress,” says Gleb Yushin, a materials scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, who was not involved with the research. If commercialized, the new batteries could help keep drivers of electric vehicles safe even if they wind up in an accident., Lithium-ion batteries contain three main components: two charge-storing electrodes and a liquid organic electrolyte that separate them. The electrolyte ferries lithium ions back and forth between the electrodes during charging and discharging, but they’re flammable., In recent years, researchers have experimented with replacing these organic electrolytes with solid electrolytes or water-based versions that can’t catch fire. But if the operating voltage of these water-based batteries exceeds 1.23 volts (V)—below that of even a 1.5-V AA battery—electrode materials can react with water molecules, splitting them into hydrogen and oxygen gases, often with explosive results. Yet when researchers stay below the 1.23-V threshold, they end up with batteries that store far less energy than traditional lithium-ion cells, which operate at about 4 V., Hope for an alternative arose in 2015, when researchers led by Chunsheng Wang, a materials scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park, reported they created a novel salt-rich water-based electrolyte. This water-in-salt electrolyte (WiSE) promotes the formation a protective solid shield around the electrodes that prevented them from ripping apart water molecules in the electrolyte’s interior. But the electrode materials in those batteries could only muster 3 V., Prospects brightened in 2017, when Wang and colleagues reported they had come up with a positively charged electrode, or anode, material that was compatible with 4-V operation and worked with the WiSE. That just left them to address the negatively charged electrode, or cathode., Now, Wang and his colleagues have done just that. They report today in Nature that they’ve come up with a graphite-based cathode that works with the WiSE at 4 V and above. The new electrode material includes bromine and chlorine, and it ends up protected from the water-based electrolyte by locking reactive electrode materials in solid salt particles around the electrode. The battery starts with lithium bound up in solid lithium-bromine and lithium-chloride salt particles surrounding a graphite electrode made up of layers of carbon atoms. When the battery charges, bromine and chlorine atoms ditch their lithium partners, give up electrons to the cathode, and wedge themselves between graphite’s carbon layers, forming another nice tight solid. The voltage difference between the two electrodes then drives the positively charged lithium ions through the water-based electrolyte to the anode, where they meet up with electrons provided by an external circuit., When the battery discharges during use, the lithium ions give up those electrons and reverse course to the cathode. The electrons travel back through the external circuit to the cathode, where bromine and chlorine atoms grab them and end up with a negative charge. This charge causes them to diffuse back out of the graphite. The lithium ions then snag them, reforming the solid salt particles that stay put until the next round of charging., Wang and his colleagues note that gram for gram, their cathode materials already have about 30% greater charge storage capacity than conventional cathode materials. But it remains to be seen whether the full batteries, including the new electrolyte, will end up holding more energy than commercial versions., Even if they don’t, the new WiSE batteries would not require cobalt, a toxic metal in conventional lithium-ion cathodes. Cobalt mining has been tied to widespread deaths of miners—often children—in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the rare metal is relatively abundant. That would make the batteries safer for not only consumers, but miners and the environment as well.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/phone_16x9.jpg?itok=--cDARI5","title":"New generation of lithium-ion batteries could hold more charge—without catching fire","authors":"Robert F.

The All of Us study run by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, has recruited 143,000 participants who have already taken surveys and visited a clinic to give blood and urine samples. Another 87,000 have at least registered for the study., Study leaders say these numbers give them confidence All of Us will reach 1 million participants within 5 or 6 years—although they will need to ramp up enrollment to reach that goal. And they expect to broaden the study’s geographic distribution, which so far largely covers just a few states., Announced by then-President Barack Obama 4 years ago, the All of Us study, which could cost $4 billion over 10 years, aims to enroll a diverse swath of U.S. inhabitants—citizens or not—who agree to share their health records and DNA on an anonymized basis. Researchers will use the data to develop “precision medicine,” or personalized treatments for others—the study participants themselves can request their genetic data but won’t receive medical help as part of the project. The 143,000 people who have given consent, taken surveys, and visited a clinic for physical measurements and to give blood and urine samples meet All of Us’s original diversity goal: Fifty-three percent are ethnic or racial minorities, far more than the 39% these groups constitute in the U.S. population. (For example, participants with self-identified African ancestry constitute 20% of the study, compared with 13% in the population.), And 80% are from groups All of Us has defined as “underrepresented in biomedical research.” That includes gay people, rural dwellers, the elderly, and those who are disabled or don’t have good access to medical care. In just its first year, “All of Us has managed to become one of largest, most diverse research resources in history,” said NIH Director Francis Collins at a 6 May event marking the study’s anniversary., The enrollment figures are not quite as rosy as they initially appear. For one thing, NIH had already enrolled 20% of the total before May 2018 during pilot testing. And some people who sign up online will never show up at a clinic to fully participate, says NIH’s Eric Dishman, director of All of Us. However, he expects enrollment to reach 4000 people a week by next fall—on track for 1 million within 6 years—as the study adds more sites. The pace will also pick up when the study eventually begins to enroll children., To speed things up, Dishman’s staff members are tweaking the study’s original plans. For example, the health provider organizations (HPOs) enrolling many participants can now include people who don’t get health care through that HPO. And a pilot project will soon send 13,000 saliva kits to people who sign up online or by phone through the study’s “direct enrollment” process. Study staff can then quickly test these volunteers’ DNA for disease-associated markers, then later have them visit a clinic to give blood for fuller genome sequencing., All of Us has also unveiled a “research hub” that holds pooled health and survey data for participants. (A “workbench” where approved researchers can work with the full data set will go online next winter.) The data show that more than two-thirds of fully enrolled participants come from just six states with participating HPOs, with 19% of participants from Arizona (which has 2% of the U.S. population). Dishman says Arizona surged ahead because it had effective “techniques and methods” for recruiting. Although the study won’t attempt to represent the U.S. population’s geographic diversity, the distribution will even out as more volunteers join the study via direct enrollment, which could end up including half of all participants, he says., Overall, Dishman is not worried about reaching 1 million volunteers. “What I am worried about is retaining 1 million,” or keeping people from dropping out during the study’s 10-year span, he says. All of Us plans to work on that by holding community events in key cities to “gin up excitement about the program and pull people through,” he says.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/all%20of%20us_16x9.jpg?itok=WsXngMnr","title":"NIH says its 1-million-person health study is off to good start","authors":"Jocelyn Kaiser","pub_date":"May. 8, 2019 , 5:15 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/nih-says-its-1-million-person-health-study-good-start"},{"abstract":"He Jiankui speaks at a 2018 conference in Hong Kong, China, where he gave a public account of creating the first gene-edited human babies., By Jon CohenMay. 8, 2019 , 2:25 PM, Four prominent Chinese bioethicists have published an unusually frank and critical assessment of their country’s handling of biomedical research in the wake of what they refer to as the “CRISPR babies’ scandal.”, Their commentary, published online today in Nature, calls for “an overhaul” in the way the biomedical experiments in China are regulated, monitored, and registered and for “severe” penalties for researchers who violate regulations. “China is at a crossroads,” write Ruipeng Lei of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, Xiaomei Zhai of Peking Union Medical College in Beijing, Wei Zhu of Fudan University in Shanghai, and Renzong Qiu of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. “The government must make substantial changes to protect others from the potential effects of reckless human experimentation.”, The authors say a “soul searching” is now taking place in China because of the November 2018 revelation that He Jiankui, a biophysicist at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, had created the world’s first babies, twin girls, who had genes edited while they were embryos. He, who was subsequently fired from his job and has not spoken publicly since he described the germline editing experiment at a Hong Kong, China, meeting, used CRISPR—which cuts DNA—to cripple a cell surface protein that HIV uses to infect cells. The intent, he said, was to “genetically vaccinate” the girls so that they would not be susceptible to the virus., In the Nature commentary, the authors criticize He for his secrecy and the country for creating an environment that encouraged him. “In our view, researchers in China are increasingly motivated by the promise of fame and fortune, rather than by a genuine desire for discovery,” they write. “And transferring devices or approaches to the clinic is not always backed by solid basic research. Moreover, researchers who can declare that they are the first to discover something, both in Asia and in the world, are disproportionately rewarded when it comes to peer review, hiring decisions and funding.”, Bioethicists outside China are impressed by the editorial. “I think it’s rather remarkable that they published this in such a prominent place,” says Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison who is on an expert committee convened by the World Health Organization to assess how to better regulate germline editing. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York City, said he “admired” the article and thought it was “courageous” for his Chinese colleagues to speak so bluntly. “They’re getting into things that haven’t been said by others in China, so that’s very good.”, The four authors contend that scientific research should be governed by the State Council, China’s cabinet, rather than the collection of government ministries that now do oversight, a system they say “is fragmented and hampered by staff incompetence or resistance.” They also urged their country to confront “the eugenic thinking that has persisted among a small proportion of Chinese scholars.”, As for He, who was strongly criticized in preliminary findings made public by a Chinese government-controlled news outlet in January from an investigation run by the Guangdong Health Commission (the province where he worked), the bioethicists suggest the government conduct a more extensive inquiry. They recommend that “a committee of internationally renowned experts in gene editing assess the data resulting from He’s work” and also offer a blueprint for monitoring the health of the twin girls for their entire lives., Science corresponded by email with Qui about the investigations surrounding He’s controversial experiment. This is an edited version of that exchange., Q: Xinhua, China’s official news agency, described the initial He inquiry as a “preliminary investigation,” which suggests it was either not complete or that there was at least another investigation underway. Do you know?, A: Nothing suggests another investigation is underway. So, we suggest a further, more extensive inquiry is needed., Q: In the United States, western European countries, Australia, and Japan, a misconduct investigation of a scientist almost always leads to a thorough report that is made public. There has been nothing issued by the Guangdong Health Commission―nothing more than a press release given only to Xinhua—and your commentary did not call for any future report to be made public. Do you think these reports should be made public?, A: Of course, I think such reports should be made public. There seem to be no rules on whether and how to report the findings of investigations on cases of violating regulations. My colleagues and I have suggested to build a central registry on genome editing which is open access to the public. The registry could also be a platform where findings of investigations on cases of violating regulations are published., Q: Have any of you been asked to help with any investigations of He?, A: Immediately after the news was broke, the National Health Commission asked Xiaomei Zhai to go to Shenzhen to investigate the case―along with some commission officials. Zhai couldn’t go because she had to attend the Hong Kong summit. There were two occasions where I was invited by government think tanks to provide advice on He’s case. I suggested the government should make thorough investigation―especially any involvement of government officials and He’s colleagues and collaborators (both in China and the U.S.), including personnel at the IVF [in vitro fertilization] clinics―because He could not be the only person responsible for the incident. It’s unclear if any government officials were involved in the He incident in any way. But He certainly had ties with some governmental officials as his work on third-generation genome sequencing was prominently featured in a state television channel., Q: Your editorial calls for “rebooting” ethics governance. If any government officials or government-funded institutions supported or indicated approval of He’s germline editing in any way, are you confident that the Guangdong Health Commission’s investigation or any other investigation led by a government agency would transparently report this?, A: Sorry, I am afraid I am not in a position to answer this question. There has been no transparency regarding who the members of the investigation team are, which procedures they have followed, or what they have found. In general, I favor that the government puts together investigation teams that consist of independent experts. I don’t know if more investigation results will be disclosed, but I think the world deserves to know the truth. And I don’t think we can properly move on or prevent similar incidents from happening again until we know exactly what has happened., I don’t believe the government per se is involved. I have some contact with deputy ministry of National Health Commission and some officials at its Department of Science and Education, and I think they are not only honest persons, but also hold the view like our bioethicists in compliance with international guidelines. In many cases, they accepted our suggestions on drafting or revising relevant regulations. However, I cannot exclude some governmental officials in some departments at different levels being involved in it., Q: Do you think independence of the investigatory team is important? Is it possible in China?, A: For a bioethicist like me and many other scholars in China, that’s a given. Of course, the investigation should be both independent and transparent. I think it’s possible if China realizes the gravity of the matter. How China deals with it will determine the reputation and the future of the country and its scientific and bioethics communities.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/He_16x9_0.jpg?itok=dkW9lWyO","title":"Chinese bioethicists call for ‘reboot’ of biomedical regulation after country’s gene-edited baby scandal","authors":"Jon Cohen","pub_date":"May. 8, 2019 , 2:25 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/chinese-bioethicists-call-reboot-biomedical-regulation-after-country-s-gene-edited-baby"},{"abstract":"Living in the gloom 2000 meters down, the silver spinyfin may see color., By Elizabeth PennisiMay. 9, 2019 , 2:00 PM, When the ancestors of cave fish and certain crickets moved into pitchblack caverns, their eyes virtually disappeared over generations. But fish that ply the sea at depths greater than sunlight can penetrate have developed super-vision, highly attuned to the faint glow and twinkle given off by other creatures. They owe this power, evolutionary biologists have learned, to an extraordinary increase in the number of genes for rod opsins, retinal proteins that detect dim light. Those extra genes have diversified to produce proteins capable of capturing every possible photon at multiple wavelengths—which could mean that despite the darkness, the fish roaming the deep ocean actually see in color., The finding \"really shakes up the dogma of deep-sea vision,\" says Megan Porter, an evolutionary biologist studying vision at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu who was not involved in the work. Researchers had observed that the deeper a fish lives, the simpler its visual system is, a trend they assumed would continue to the bottom. \"That [the deepest dwellers] have all these opsins means there's a lot more complexity in the interplay between light and evolution in the deep sea than we realized,\" Porter says., At a depth of 1000 meters, the last glimmer of sunlight is gone. But over the past 15 years, researchers have realized that the depths are pervaded by a faint bioluminescence from flashing shrimp, octopus, bacteria, and even fish. Most vertebrate eyes could barely detect this subtle shimmer. To learn how fish can see it, a team led by evolutionary biologist Walter Salzburger from the University of Basel in Switzerland studied deep-sea fishes' opsin proteins. Variation in the opsins' amino acid sequences changes the wavelength of light detected, so multiple opsins make color vision possible. One opsin, RH1, works well in low light. Found in the eye's rod cells, it enables humans to see in the dark—but only in black and white., Salzburger and his colleagues searched for opsin genes in 101 fish species, including seven Atlantic Ocean deep-sea fish whose genomes they fully sequenced. Most fish have one or two RH1 opsins, like many other vertebrates, but four of the deep-sea species stood apart, the researchers report this week in Science. Those fish—the lantern-fish, a tube-eye fish, and two spinyfins—all had at least five RH1 genes, and one, the silver spinyfin (Diretmus argenteus), had 38. \"This is unheard of in vertebrate vision,\" says K. Kristian Donner, a sensory biologist at the University of Helsinki., To make sure the extra genes weren't just nonfunctional duplicates, the team measured gene activity in 36 species, including specimens of 11 deep-sea fish. Multiple RH1 genes were active in the deep-sea species, and the total was 14 in an adult silver spinyfin, which thrives down to 2000 meters. \"At first it seems paradoxical—this is where there's the least amount of light,\" Salzburger says., The retina of the silver spinyfin (Diretmus argenteus) has an unusual arrangement of low light–sensing rod cells, which house diverse photoreceptor proteins (right). Some of the rod layers are stacked to best capture the few photons available below a depth of 1000 meters., Researchers can predict the wavelengths that an opsin protein is most sensitive to from its amino acid sequence. The deep-sea fish had a total of 24 mutations that alter the function of their RH1 proteins, fine-tuning each to see a narrow range of blue and green wavelengths—the colors of bioluminescence. \"Some of these opsins might be tuned to detect particular bioluminescent signals associated with food, danger, or social interactions,\" says Gil Rosenthal, a behavioral ecologist at Texas A&M University in College Station., The four deep-sea species belong to three different branches of the fish family tree, indicating that this supervision evolved repeatedly. \"This indicates that animals living in extreme light environments may be subject to extreme natural selective pressures to improve visual performance,\" says Eric Warrant, a visual ecologist at Lund University in Sweden., The bountiful opsins also help explain the unusual anatomy of the spinyfin retina. Some of its rod cells are much longer than usual, and many are stacked one on top of another rather than arranged in a single layer. The enlarged cells and the stacking help ensure more incoming photons are detected, but researchers have long assumed these rods all had the same opsin. Now, it appears that, like the layers in old photographic film, rods of different sizes might capture different wavelengths of light. \"We now have to accept that our view [of deep-sea vision] has been too limited,\" Donner says., Because of the depths these fish inhabit, it's impossible to collect live specimens to test their vision. But the multiple rod opsins may enable them to distinguish color, Salzburger and others agree. For these fish, the faint bioluminescence in the inky depths could be as vivid and varied as the bright surface world.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/aav4632_Cover-Possibility_seq3_v1_online_only.jpg?itok=Elq1JAAK","title":"In the deep, dark, ocean fish have evolved superpowered vision","authors":"Elizabeth Pennisi","pub_date":"May. 9, 2019 , 2:00 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/deep-dark-ocean-fish-have-evolved-superpowered-vision"},{"abstract":"By Alex FoxMay. 10, 2019 , 4:45 PM, Archaeologists find richest cache of ancient mind-altering drugs in South America, Researchers have discovered a 1000-year-old bag containing the most varied combination of psychoactive compounds found at an ancient South American site, including cocaine and the primary ingredients in a hallucinogenic tea called ayahuasca.

But what works for a game doesn’t work for risky real-world tasks like driving a car, where “losing” might involve a high-speed collision. To drive safely, humans have an exquisite feedback system: our fight-or-flight response, in which physiological reactions like a rapid heart rate and sweaty palms signal “fear,” and so keep us vigilant and, theoretically, out of trouble. Now, researchers at Microsoft are giving artificial intelligence (AI) programs a rough analog of anxiety to help them sense when they’re pushing their luck., The scientists placed sensors on people’s fingers to record pulse amplitude while they were in a driving simulator, as a measure of arousal. An algorithm used those recordings—80 minutes divided among four people—to learn to predict an average person’s pulse amplitude at each moment on the course. It then used those “fear” signals as a guide while learning to drive through the virtual world: If a human would be scared here, it might muse, “I’m doing something wrong.” AIs using this method still had to crash to learn safe driving skills, but they required 25% fewer crashes to reach the same level of performance as a nonfearful AI, the researchers reported this week at the International Conference on Learning Representations here., The researchers wondered whether this kind of arousal was just a rough proxy for distance to walls, so they trained another AI to drive using wall proximity instead of fear. But fear proved more useful, likely because it encodes a richer set of expectations, including the feeling of turning too rapidly, the paper hypothesizes., Emotions help humans learn and make decisions, and researchers say this paper is a proof of concept that giving AIs viscerallike responses can bring their abilities closer to our own. It also suggests another application: training autonomous vehicles to avoid driving in a way that makes passengers uncomfortable or car sick, even if it’s safe.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/driving_16x9.jpg?itok=oVFyM9WE","title":"Scientists teach computers fear—to make them better drivers","authors":"Matthew Hutson","pub_date":"May. 10, 2019 , 3:20 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/scientists-teach-computers-fear-make-them-better-drivers"},{"abstract":"Dog cognition and social behavior have hogged the scientific limelight for years—showing in study after study that canines have social skills essential to their relationships with people.

But they can calm down by picking up on humans' emotional cues, as Kitty does with a smiling Kristyn Vitale., By David GrimmMay. 9, 2019 , 2:00 PM, CORVALLIS, OREGON—Carl the cat was born to beat the odds. Abandoned on the side of the road in a Rubbermaid container, the scrawny black kitten—with white paws, white chest, and a white, skunklike stripe down his nose—was rescued by Kristyn Vitale, a postdoc at Oregon State University here who just happens to study the feline mind. Now, Vitale hopes Carl will pull off another coup, by performing a feat of social smarts researchers once thought was impossible., In a stark white laboratory room, Vitale sits against the back wall, flanked by two overturned cardboard bowls. An undergraduate research assistant kneels a couple of meters away, holding Carl firmly., \"Carl!\" Vitale calls, and then points to one of the bowls. The assistant lets go., Toddlers pass this test easily. They know that when we point at something, we're telling them to look at it—an insight into the intentions of others that will become essential as children learn to interact with people around them. Most other animals, including our closest living relative, chimpanzees, fail the experiment. But about 20 years ago, researchers discovered something surprising: Dogs pass the test with flying colors. The finding shook the scientific community and led to an explosion of studies into the canine mind., Cats like Carl were supposed to be a contrast. Like dogs, cats have lived with us in close quarters for thousands of years. But unlike our canine pals, cats descend from antisocial ancestors, and humans have spent far less time aggressively molding them into companions. So researchers thought cats couldn't possibly share our brain waves the way dogs do., Yet, as cats are apt to do, Carl defies the best-laid plans of Homo sapiens. He trots right over to the bowl Vitale is pointing at, passing the test as easily as his canine rivals. \"Good boy!\" Vitale coos., Carl isn't alone. After years when scientists largely ignored social intelligence in cats, labs studying feline social cognition have popped up around the globe, and a small but growing number of studies is showing that cats match dogs in many tests of social smarts. The work could transform the widespread image of cats as aloof or untamed. It also may eventually offer insight into how domestication transformed wild animals into our best friends, and even hint at how the human mind itself changed over the course of evolution., That is, if the cats themselves deign to participate., Carl's canine predecessor was a black Labrador retriever named Oreo. In the spring of 1996, Brian Hare, then an undergrad at Emory University in Atlanta, was studying how toddlers pass the pointing test. \"I turned to my adviser,\" says Hare, now an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, \"and said, ‘I think my dog can do that.’\", In 1998, Hare and Ádám Miklósi, a cognitive ethologist at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, independently published studies showing dogs could understand human pointing. Until then, social cognition researchers had paid little attention to dogs, thinking their minds had been \"corrupted\" by thousands of years of domestication., Hare's and Miklósi's finding sparked a canine cognition revolution, helping confirm that domesticated animals such as dogs were worthy of study. More than a dozen labs around the world have since churned out hundreds of papers on the canine mind. Researchers have learned that dogs can recognize emotion in people's faces, understand components of human speech, and may even have a sense of fairness and ethics. Those abilities probably helped turn canines into loyal, trusted companions and enabled them to perform socially complex tasks, as varied as guiding the blind and serving with military units., As dogs nuzzled their way up the cognitive tree, however, cats were left clawing at the roots. By 2004, researchers had published more than two dozen papers on canine social cognition—and none on felines. And yet, aside from dogs, no other animal is as prevalent or cherished in the human home. \"The scientific output doesn't match the popularity of cats,\" Miklósi says. \"We know more about how wolves think.\", Miklósi himself tried to change that in 2005. In the first study to directly compare how cats and dogs communicate with people, he and colleagues conducted the pointing test at pet owners' homes. The cats performed as well as the dogs. But, foreshadowing a headache that would plague the field of feline social cognition, several cats \"dropped out\" of the study, according to the research paper. Some stopped paying attention. Others simply walked away from the testing site., What should have been the beginning of a revolution in feline social cognition turned out to be a dead end. No one followed up on Miklósi's study, including Miklósi himself, who vowed never to work with cats again. \"I think everybody tried, and almost everybody gave up,\" he says, laughing. It would be nearly a decade before almost anyone tried again., Back at Oregon State, a heavy-set calico named Lyla has entered the white lab room along with her owner, Clara. As we watch on a video feed, Lyla slinks low to the ground and suddenly freezes—eyes dilated—when a door slams in the adjoining hallway. Then things get worse: Clara leaves. Lyla begins to circle, seemingly in a panic, and then creeps toward the door where Clara exited. Then Lyla meows. And meows. And meows., \"Our record is 61 cries in 2 minutes,\" says Vitale, who runs the cat research program here. After 2 minutes, Clara returns to the room and sits cross-legged on the floor. Lyla immediately walks over and rubs against her owner's legs and face while Clara strokes her. Then, calmer than she's been since she arrived, Lyla walks away from Clara and begins to explore the room, sniffing its corners and batting a feather toy., \"People think that's a sign the cat doesn't care about the owner,\" Vitale says. \"But it's actually the opposite.\" Lyla, she says, is showing that she trusts Clara so much that she feels comfortable going off on her own as long as Clara is around. In essence, Clara is her security blanket., To find out whether your cat can pass some common tests of social intelligence, try these simplified experiments at home. Make sure your cat is calm and relaxed before you start., Vitale grew up with cats and, like Miklósi, wondered why no one had bothered to study their social mind. \"There was a void in the research world I was drawn to,\" she says. \"I saw the projects that could be done.\" She came to Oregon State as a graduate student in 2014 to work with Monique Udell, an animal behaviorist who had published studies on dogs, wolves, and even bats., Vitale was well prepared to add cats to the lab's repertoire. She has four at home, and at Oregon State she began to run kitten classes for the community, teaching cats to socialize with strangers and other felines and even walk on a leash. That experience came in handy for acclimating the animals to the alien environment of the laboratory. (Vitale's tricks include coaxing cats into the experimental room by leading them with a feather dangling from a plastic rod, and she wears a fanny pack loaded with five kinds of treats.), In 2017, Vitale and Udell showed that cats preferred interacting with people over food and toys. This year, the team reported that cats spend more time with humans who pay attention to them—such as by clicking at them and calling their name. Similar behavior in dogs has been used to argue that canines are tuned in to our \"attentional state,\" allowing them to pick up on our gestures, commands, and other social cues. Vitale is also exploring whether cats that have \"passed\" her kitten class are more attached to their owners or more sensitive to human emotions—a skill Lyla is about to demonstrate., Vitale enters the white lab room and places a fan taped with black and white streamers on the floor. Then, she turns it on and leaves. As the streamers shoot out from the fan and crackle against each other, Lyla crawls back to Clara and circles her, as though looking for reassurance. Then, as previously instructed by Vitale, Clara begins to make friends with the fan. \"What a nice fan,\" she murmurs soothingly to the object. And then, to Lyla, \"Don't you want to see the fan?\" Remarkably, Lyla approaches the fan and lies down next to it. \"She's picking up on Clara's positive state of mind,\" Vitale says., Few species understand what human pointing means, but Lyla aces the test (top)—assuming she’s paying attention., Similar work, published by Italian researchers in 2015, was the first to show that cats, like dogs, can shape their behavior to human emotions—something many pet owners may have suspected but that hadn't been scientifically demonstrated. The Italian group also found that most of the cats looked back and forth between the fan and their owner, as though trying to suss out how they should respond to the object., Meanwhile, ethologist Péter Pongrácz, a colleague of Miklósi's at Eötvös Loránd, has taken the pointing test to the next level. Instead of using fingers, members of his team simply gazed at an object, sometimes just for a split second. Cats followed the gaze 70% of the time, the group reported late last year, similar to the performance of dogs., Most animals rarely gaze at each other, and when they do it's often a sign of hostility, Pongrácz says. To see cats use gaze the way people do—to share information—is \"really surprising,\" he says. \"The findings provide stronger proof that cats have evolved to be capable of complex communication with humans.\", The discovery also impresses Christian Nawroth, a behavioral biologist who studies social cognition in livestock at the Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology in Dummerstorf, Germany. He has shown that pigs can follow pointing, but only with lots of training, and that they struggle to follow gaze. \"The performance rates of cats really surprised me,\" he says. \"We haven't seen that with farm animals.\", It's true that many cats won't pass social intelligence tests as well as dogs, Miklósi says. But that's likely because they're in an unfamiliar environment or with unfamiliar people, which can stress them out. What's important, he says, is that some cats can pass the tests, suggesting these abilities are inherent to the species. \"If you take a well-socialized, calm cat, I think it's going to perform similarly to a dog.\", Additional studies on cats are happening in labs from Mexico to Japan. Researchers are showing that cats perceive some optical illusions the same way we do and that they can distinguish their owners' voices from those of strangers. \"The field is definitely expanding,\" Vitale says. \"Cats are finally getting their due.\", But when it comes to catching up with dogs, cats may turn out to be their own worst enemy., A few years back, Pongrácz brought a cat into his lab for a study. \"In less than a minute, it escaped and got into an air duct,\" he says. \"We were terrified. We had to wait an hour for it to come out.\", Things didn't go much better with his gaze experiments. Pongrácz's team did the work in cats' homes, thinking they would be better behaved there, but some felines either didn't cooperate or dived under the sofa. Other cats—frustrated by being held when they knew the researchers had treats—scratched and wriggled their way out of their owners' arms. \"It's like suddenly the cat has 10 legs,\" Pongrácz says., The team started with 99 cats but got usable data on only 41. In other labs, cats have leapt out of mazes topped with nets designed to keep them inside, leaving the whole setup in disarray. And some researchers have had to deprive cats of food for up to 8 hours just to motivate them to crave a treat. \"If you want results on one cat,\" Miklósi says, \"you have to test three.\", Those stats concern Alex Taylor, a comparative psychologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who has studied cognition in crows, dogs, and other animals. \"There's a lot of solid science going on in these cat studies, but it's taking a lot of resources to produce the data,\" he says. \"It would give me pause about working with cats.\", Research money is also scarce. Pongrácz funded the gaze study out of his own pocket. And Atsuko Saito, a psychologist at Sophia University in Tokyo who just last month showed that cats seem to know their names even when a stranger says them, says she can't get grants either., Kristyn Vitale with her cat Carl. New research suggests cats are more socially bonded to humans than many people had suspected., Even Vitale is struggling. Her postdoc funding ends in October, and though she has grant applications out, she's worried that the work, lacking direct applications to people, won't win support from funding agencies such as the National Institutes of Health. \"If I leave,\" she says, \"pretty much everything I do would leave with me.\", Yet even the limited work on cats so far could help unravel some of the mysteries of how we bonded so closely with our pets. Dogs and cats traveled different roads to the human home: Dogs evolved from the social, cooperative gray wolf and are the product of thousands of years of intensive breeding and selection by humans. Cats, by contrast, descend from the fiercely antisocial and territorial Near Eastern wildcat, and they largely domesticated themselves, as the tamest cats began to hang out and hunt rodents in early farming villages. Both species seem to have evolved the same skills to live alongside us, however, suggesting those skills are crucial to domestication., Reading complex human cues such as gaze may have allowed cats and dogs to communicate with people in a way other animals can't. And puppies and kittens seem to pick up those skills right away, whereas animals such as wolves can take months to understand something even simpler, such as pointing., Still, Nawroth and Taylor say it's too early to tell whether the social intelligence of cats and dogs is more advanced than that of other domesticated animals. If we shared our beds with pigs, they might be just as good at following the human gaze. And Hare argues that to truly understand what has changed in the feline mind through evolution, researchers will need to compare cats with their direct ancestors—for example, by exploring how the wildcat responds to social cues from humans and other cats., Such work could give us a fresh insight into another domesticated species: humans. Like cats, our ancestors may have self-domesticated, becoming less aggressive and more cooperative over evolutionary time. \"It would be interesting to see if the things that changed in cats also changed in us,\" Nawroth says., Udell wonders whether one such trait was our ability to live alongside other species, the way cats and dogs have evolved to live alongside us. \"Maybe it's not just cats and dogs that have become more socially flexible,\" she says. \"Perhaps we have as well.\", As Vitale finishes her work with Lyla, a research assistant brings in her own cat, a gray and brown striped tabby named Moody. His name turns out to be appropriate. In the lab, he first encounters a person who plays with him and then one who ignores him. He quickly learns to approach the friendly person and avoid the indifferent one. Then Vitale enters the room. Will she play with him or brush him off? Moody apparently assumes the latter, keeping his distance. \"That's a sign of pessimism,\" she says., Vitale herself is cautiously optimistic. She recognizes the challenges of working with cats, but she hopes scientists see the potential, too. \"Cats are now where dogs were a couple of decades ago,\" she says. \"I hope researchers give them a chance to show what they can do.\", There's a very widespread belief that cats are stupid and selfish. The new results are pushing back on that., Despite his reservations about working with cats, Taylor thinks the field will grow. Having owners bring pets into a lab is much easier than housing other species yourself, he says. \"We're moving from the rat and pigeon phase of comparative psychology to the dog and cat phase.\", Vitale hopes the new findings will help workers make shelter cats more adoptable—they often lack the social skills of their house cat counterparts—and lead to improved ways to calm separation anxiety and other social disorders in felines., And both she and Pongrácz think the research will help dispel negative perceptions about cats. When it comes to social skills, \"There's a very widespread belief that cats are stupid and selfish,\" Pongrácz says. \"The new results are pushing back on that.\", Meanwhile, Miklósi has returned to the feline fold. For example, he's considering using touch screens to see whether cats can categorize objects such as landscapes and animals, as dogs can. \"I've been working with dogs for 25 years. It's getting harder and harder to find something new and exciting to do with them,\" he says. \"Cats are still exciting. Maybe it's the time of the cat.\"","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ca_0510NF_Cat_Cognition_Fan_1280x720.jpg?itok=kD2kQQBu","title":"Cats rival dogs on many tests of social smarts.

As a key component of cement, asphalt, and glass, sand is integral to every aspect of our lives. It is in our phones, our schools, our hospitals, and our roads. Globally, humans consume up to 50 billion metric tons of sand and gravel every year, amounting to 18 kilograms per person per day., But our insatiable demand for sand now poses “one of the major sustainability challenges of the 21stcentury,\" and meeting it will require “improved governance of global sand resources,” concludes a United Nations (UN) report released this week. In particular, the report recommends encouraging ways of reducing demand for new sand and strengthening policies aimed at discouraging the harmful environmental impacts of sand mining. It also recommends developing a more traceable sand supply chain through better monitoring and international information sharing., The UN recommendations are “very timely,” says geologist Minik Rosing of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, because sand “is a natural resource that transcends national borders, and… extraction frequently has consequences beyond national borders.”, The report represents the first global effort to recommend solutions to sand-related problems, says environmental scientist Pascal Peduzzi, an author of the report and director of GRID-Geneva, a part of the UN’s Science Division based in Châtelaine, Switzerland. He became aware of the issue after a trip to investigate beach erosion in Jamaica, he says. “We went to a small fishing village, and the villagers told us that one night some people came with trucks, armed with guns, and they stole their beach away,” Peduzzi recalls. “I was shocked that just for sand, people were ready to kill.”, In 2014, Peduzzi wrote a UN report titled, “Sand: rarer than one thinks,” that focused on sand extraction’s environmental impact. “But at the time, I had limited solutions to offer,” he says. Then, in October 2018, the UN organized a roundtable discussion in Geneva, Switzerland, at which researchers, policy experts, and industry representatives discussed both the scope of the problem and potential solutions., Demand for sand is rising, the report notes. In Asia and Africa, a construction boom has increased demand three-fold over the past two decades. Globally, extraction of sand and gravel is projected to rise to 82 billion metric tons by 2060. Abundant desert sand, however, is too smooth to use for building materials, so most sand is sourced from quarries. Increasingly, it is also mined from coastal beaches and dredged from fragile river and marine ecosystems, causing harm to aquifers, fisheries and protected areas. And rising prices have prompted “sand mafias” that illegally exploit sand resources to appear in countries such as India and Morocco., Extraction—both legal and illegal—“comes at the expense of other economic sectors, local livelihoods and biodiversity,” according to the report. And “growth in the extraction and use of these minerals is putting strain on the resource base and will likely lead to a ‘tragedy of the sand commons’ unless a more responsible appropriation of these resources is promoted,” says Aurora Torres, an ecologist at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig., To avoid that tragedy, the world should focus on “reducing natural sand extraction and its impacts in the near term,” the report states. One recommendation is to eliminate unnecessary building projects and speculative building. When building new structures is necessary, recycling old materials is a good option, particularly for developed countries that already have a lot of infrastructure, the report says. Germany, for instance, recycles 87 percent of its waste aggregate materials. Recycled ash from burned solid waste can also replace sand., When new sand is needed, it should come from stable quarries, if possible, and not aquatic ecosystems. And to ensure that users know their sand is coming from less damaging sources, governments and businesses should create supply chains and regulatory structures that trace sand from its source to the final buyer., Such recommendations are a good start, says Torres. But the issue is still “understudied” and “rarely” comes up in scientific circles, she says. “Hopefully this report will contribute to paving the way for more dialogue, interaction, and collaboration between all the sectors and actors connected by sand flows. It is time to treat sand like a resource, on a par with clean air, biodiversity, and other natural endowments that nations seek to manage for the future.”, The report, which was circulated to policymakers at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya this past March, has already resulted in a new UN resolution that calls for sustainable sand management practices., Meanwhile, some nations are eyeing the potential to exploit new sand resources. In Greenland, melting ice is expected to deposit piles of sand on the coast, where it could be exported. Greenland could be a promising source, says Rosing, because “the environmental consequences are likely to be low, governance standards are high, and there will be likely co-benefits for indigenous people.”","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/3072317592_fcaf891700_o.jpg?itok=NLo2WkTw","title":"The world needs to get serious about managing sand, says UN report","authors":"Rachel Fritts","pub_date":"May. 10, 2019 , 5:11 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/world-needs-get-serious-about-managing-sand-says-un-report"},{"abstract":"Living in the gloom 2000 meters down, the silver spinyfin may see color., By Elizabeth PennisiMay. 9, 2019 , 2:00 PM, When the ancestors of cave fish and certain crickets moved into pitchblack caverns, their eyes virtually disappeared over generations. But fish that ply the sea at depths greater than sunlight can penetrate have developed super-vision, highly attuned to the faint glow and twinkle given off by other creatures. They owe this power, evolutionary biologists have learned, to an extraordinary increase in the number of genes for rod opsins, retinal proteins that detect dim light. Those extra genes have diversified to produce proteins capable of capturing every possible photon at multiple wavelengths—which could mean that despite the darkness, the fish roaming the deep ocean actually see in color., The finding \"really shakes up the dogma of deep-sea vision,\" says Megan Porter, an evolutionary biologist studying vision at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu who was not involved in the work. Researchers had observed that the deeper a fish lives, the simpler its visual system is, a trend they assumed would continue to the bottom. \"That [the deepest dwellers] have all these opsins means there's a lot more complexity in the interplay between light and evolution in the deep sea than we realized,\" Porter says., At a depth of 1000 meters, the last glimmer of sunlight is gone. But over the past 15 years, researchers have realized that the depths are pervaded by a faint bioluminescence from flashing shrimp, octopus, bacteria, and even fish. Most vertebrate eyes could barely detect this subtle shimmer. To learn how fish can see it, a team led by evolutionary biologist Walter Salzburger from the University of Basel in Switzerland studied deep-sea fishes' opsin proteins. Variation in the opsins' amino acid sequences changes the wavelength of light detected, so multiple opsins make color vision possible. One opsin, RH1, works well in low light. Found in the eye's rod cells, it enables humans to see in the dark—but only in black and white., Salzburger and his colleagues searched for opsin genes in 101 fish species, including seven Atlantic Ocean deep-sea fish whose genomes they fully sequenced. Most fish have one or two RH1 opsins, like many other vertebrates, but four of the deep-sea species stood apart, the researchers report this week in Science. Those fish—the lantern-fish, a tube-eye fish, and two spinyfins—all had at least five RH1 genes, and one, the silver spinyfin (Diretmus argenteus), had 38. \"This is unheard of in vertebrate vision,\" says K. Kristian Donner, a sensory biologist at the University of Helsinki., To make sure the extra genes weren't just nonfunctional duplicates, the team measured gene activity in 36 species, including specimens of 11 deep-sea fish. Multiple RH1 genes were active in the deep-sea species, and the total was 14 in an adult silver spinyfin, which thrives down to 2000 meters. \"At first it seems paradoxical—this is where there's the least amount of light,\" Salzburger says., The retina of the silver spinyfin (Diretmus argenteus) has an unusual arrangement of low light–sensing rod cells, which house diverse photoreceptor proteins (right). Some of the rod layers are stacked to best capture the few photons available below a depth of 1000 meters., Researchers can predict the wavelengths that an opsin protein is most sensitive to from its amino acid sequence. The deep-sea fish had a total of 24 mutations that alter the function of their RH1 proteins, fine-tuning each to see a narrow range of blue and green wavelengths—the colors of bioluminescence. \"Some of these opsins might be tuned to detect particular bioluminescent signals associated with food, danger, or social interactions,\" says Gil Rosenthal, a behavioral ecologist at Texas A&M University in College Station., The four deep-sea species belong to three different branches of the fish family tree, indicating that this supervision evolved repeatedly. \"This indicates that animals living in extreme light environments may be subject to extreme natural selective pressures to improve visual performance,\" says Eric Warrant, a visual ecologist at Lund University in Sweden., The bountiful opsins also help explain the unusual anatomy of the spinyfin retina. Some of its rod cells are much longer than usual, and many are stacked one on top of another rather than arranged in a single layer. The enlarged cells and the stacking help ensure more incoming photons are detected, but researchers have long assumed these rods all had the same opsin. Now, it appears that, like the layers in old photographic film, rods of different sizes might capture different wavelengths of light. \"We now have to accept that our view [of deep-sea vision] has been too limited,\" Donner says., Because of the depths these fish inhabit, it's impossible to collect live specimens to test their vision.

The nitrogen-rich feces enrich the soil and create hot spots with lots of biological diversity that can extend more than 1000 meters beyond the borders of penguin and seal colonies, according to a new study., Scientists trekked through fields of waste created by elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and Antarctic penguins, including gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), chinstrap (P. antarcticus, pictured), and Adélie penguins (P. adeliae). The team examined the soil and plants surrounding these colonies at three separate locations along the Antarctic peninsula. Where there are more seals and penguins—and more of their poop—there was more biodiversity in the land, the researchers report today in Current Biology., The feces partially evaporate as ammonia, which then can get blown more than 1000 meters inland by the wind and is absorbed into the soil, the scientists note. This ammonia then creates a cycle of nutrient enrichment: The nitrogen is consumed by plants and lichens, which in turn support an incredible number of invertebrates, including mites, springtails, and roundworms. In fact, the team identified millions of invertebrates per square meter of soil surrounding the seal and penguin colonies—up to eight times higher than the number found in other parts of the peninsula., These findings offer scientists a stronger understanding of how life can thrive in the coldest place on Earth. Now, the big question is whether these biodiversity hot spots will create perfect breeding grounds for something else: invasive plant species that can threaten the future of these environments.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/penguin_16x9_1.jpg?itok=-CGRA0bf","title":"Life thrives in Antarctic hot spots created by seal and penguin poop","authors":"Helen Santoro","pub_date":"May. 9, 2019 , 11:00 AM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/life-thrives-antarctic-hot-spots-created-seal-and-penguin-poop"},{"abstract":"The National Institutes of Health’s All of Us health study aims to enroll 1 million participants, including children, within 6 years., By Jocelyn KaiserMay. 8, 2019 , 5:15 PM, A plan to entice 1 million people in the United States to volunteer for a huge study of health and genes is making good progress 1 year after its national launch, organizers said this week. The All of Us study run by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, has recruited 143,000 participants who have already taken surveys and visited a clinic to give blood and urine samples. Another 87,000 have at least registered for the study., Study leaders say these numbers give them confidence All of Us will reach 1 million participants within 5 or 6 years—although they will need to ramp up enrollment to reach that goal. And they expect to broaden the study’s geographic distribution, which so far largely covers just a few states., Announced by then-President Barack Obama 4 years ago, the All of Us study, which could cost $4 billion over 10 years, aims to enroll a diverse swath of U.S. inhabitants—citizens or not—who agree to share their health records and DNA on an anonymized basis. Researchers will use the data to develop “precision medicine,” or personalized treatments for others—the study participants themselves can request their genetic data but won’t receive medical help as part of the project. The 143,000 people who have given consent, taken surveys, and visited a clinic for physical measurements and to give blood and urine samples meet All of Us’s original diversity goal: Fifty-three percent are ethnic or racial minorities, far more than the 39% these groups constitute in the U.S. population. (For example, participants with self-identified African ancestry constitute 20% of the study, compared with 13% in the population.), And 80% are from groups All of Us has defined as “underrepresented in biomedical research.” That includes gay people, rural dwellers, the elderly, and those who are disabled or don’t have good access to medical care. In just its first year, “All of Us has managed to become one of largest, most diverse research resources in history,” said NIH Director Francis Collins at a 6 May event marking the study’s anniversary., The enrollment figures are not quite as rosy as they initially appear. For one thing, NIH had already enrolled 20% of the total before May 2018 during pilot testing. And some people who sign up online will never show up at a clinic to fully participate, says NIH’s Eric Dishman, director of All of Us. However, he expects enrollment to reach 4000 people a week by next fall—on track for 1 million within 6 years—as the study adds more sites. The pace will also pick up when the study eventually begins to enroll children., To speed things up, Dishman’s staff members are tweaking the study’s original plans. For example, the health provider organizations (HPOs) enrolling many participants can now include people who don’t get health care through that HPO. And a pilot project will soon send 13,000 saliva kits to people who sign up online or by phone through the study’s “direct enrollment” process. Study staff can then quickly test these volunteers’ DNA for disease-associated markers, then later have them visit a clinic to give blood for fuller genome sequencing., All of Us has also unveiled a “research hub” that holds pooled health and survey data for participants. (A “workbench” where approved researchers can work with the full data set will go online next winter.) The data show that more than two-thirds of fully enrolled participants come from just six states with participating HPOs, with 19% of participants from Arizona (which has 2% of the U.S. population). Dishman says Arizona surged ahead because it had effective “techniques and methods” for recruiting. Although the study won’t attempt to represent the U.S. population’s geographic diversity, the distribution will even out as more volunteers join the study via direct enrollment, which could end up including half of all participants, he says., Overall, Dishman is not worried about reaching 1 million volunteers. “What I am worried about is retaining 1 million,” or keeping people from dropping out during the study’s 10-year span, he says. All of Us plans to work on that by holding community events in key cities to “gin up excitement about the program and pull people through,” he says.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/all%20of%20us_16x9.jpg?itok=WsXngMnr","title":"NIH says its 1-million-person health study is off to good start","authors":"Jocelyn Kaiser","pub_date":"May. 8, 2019 , 5:15 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/nih-says-its-1-million-person-health-study-good-start"},{"abstract":"A Samsung Galaxy Note 7 after its lithium-ion battery caught fire, By Robert F. ServiceMay. 8, 2019 , 2:10 PM, Lithium-ion batteries power everything from laptops to lawn mowers. But they can ignite when damaged because they rely on flammable components. Now, researchers report they’ve redesigned these batteries to work with nonflammable materials. As a bonus, the new batteries might even store more power than current models., The work is “absolutely remarkable progress,” says Gleb Yushin, a materials scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, who was not involved with the research. If commercialized, the new batteries could help keep drivers of electric vehicles safe even if they wind up in an accident., Lithium-ion batteries contain three main components: two charge-storing electrodes and a liquid organic electrolyte that separate them. The electrolyte ferries lithium ions back and forth between the electrodes during charging and discharging, but they’re flammable., In recent years, researchers have experimented with replacing these organic electrolytes with solid electrolytes or water-based versions that can’t catch fire. But if the operating voltage of these water-based batteries exceeds 1.23 volts (V)—below that of even a 1.5-V AA battery—electrode materials can react with water molecules, splitting them into hydrogen and oxygen gases, often with explosive results. Yet when researchers stay below the 1.23-V threshold, they end up with batteries that store far less energy than traditional lithium-ion cells, which operate at about 4 V., Hope for an alternative arose in 2015, when researchers led by Chunsheng Wang, a materials scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park, reported they created a novel salt-rich water-based electrolyte. This water-in-salt electrolyte (WiSE) promotes the formation a protective solid shield around the electrodes that prevented them from ripping apart water molecules in the electrolyte’s interior. But the electrode materials in those batteries could only muster 3 V., Prospects brightened in 2017, when Wang and colleagues reported they had come up with a positively charged electrode, or anode, material that was compatible with 4-V operation and worked with the WiSE. That just left them to address the negatively charged electrode, or cathode., Now, Wang and his colleagues have done just that. They report today in Nature that they’ve come up with a graphite-based cathode that works with the WiSE at 4 V and above. The new electrode material includes bromine and chlorine, and it ends up protected from the water-based electrolyte by locking reactive electrode materials in solid salt particles around the electrode. The battery starts with lithium bound up in solid lithium-bromine and lithium-chloride salt particles surrounding a graphite electrode made up of layers of carbon atoms. When the battery charges, bromine and chlorine atoms ditch their lithium partners, give up electrons to the cathode, and wedge themselves between graphite’s carbon layers, forming another nice tight solid. The voltage difference between the two electrodes then drives the positively charged lithium ions through the water-based electrolyte to the anode, where they meet up with electrons provided by an external circuit., When the battery discharges during use, the lithium ions give up those electrons and reverse course to the cathode. The electrons travel back through the external circuit to the cathode, where bromine and chlorine atoms grab them and end up with a negative charge. This charge causes them to diffuse back out of the graphite. The lithium ions then snag them, reforming the solid salt particles that stay put until the next round of charging., Wang and his colleagues note that gram for gram, their cathode materials already have about 30% greater charge storage capacity than conventional cathode materials. But it remains to be seen whether the full batteries, including the new electrolyte, will end up holding more energy than commercial versions., Even if they don’t, the new WiSE batteries would not require cobalt, a toxic metal in conventional lithium-ion cathodes. Cobalt mining has been tied to widespread deaths of miners—often children—in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the rare metal is relatively abundant. That would make the batteries safer for not only consumers, but miners and the environment as well.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/phone_16x9.jpg?itok=--cDARI5","title":"New generation of lithium-ion batteries could hold more charge—without catching fire","authors":"Robert F.

He, who was subsequently fired from his job and has not spoken publicly since he described the germline editing experiment at a Hong Kong, China, meeting, used CRISPR—which cuts DNA—to cripple a cell surface protein that HIV uses to infect cells. The intent, he said, was to “genetically vaccinate” the girls so that they would not be susceptible to the virus., In the Nature commentary, the authors criticize He for his secrecy and the country for creating an environment that encouraged him. “In our view, researchers in China are increasingly motivated by the promise of fame and fortune, rather than by a genuine desire for discovery,” they write. “And transferring devices or approaches to the clinic is not always backed by solid basic research. Moreover, researchers who can declare that they are the first to discover something, both in Asia and in the world, are disproportionately rewarded when it comes to peer review, hiring decisions and funding.”, Bioethicists outside China are impressed by the editorial. “I think it’s rather remarkable that they published this in such a prominent place,” says Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison who is on an expert committee convened by the World Health Organization to assess how to better regulate germline editing. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York City, said he “admired” the article and thought it was “courageous” for his Chinese colleagues to speak so bluntly. “They’re getting into things that haven’t been said by others in China, so that’s very good.”, The four authors contend that scientific research should be governed by the State Council, China’s cabinet, rather than the collection of government ministries that now do oversight, a system they say “is fragmented and hampered by staff incompetence or resistance.” They also urged their country to confront “the eugenic thinking that has persisted among a small proportion of Chinese scholars.”, As for He, who was strongly criticized in preliminary findings made public by a Chinese government-controlled news outlet in January from an investigation run by the Guangdong Health Commission (the province where he worked), the bioethicists suggest the government conduct a more extensive inquiry. They recommend that “a committee of internationally renowned experts in gene editing assess the data resulting from He’s work” and also offer a blueprint for monitoring the health of the twin girls for their entire lives., Science corresponded by email with Qui about the investigations surrounding He’s controversial experiment. This is an edited version of that exchange., Q: Xinhua, China’s official news agency, described the initial He inquiry as a “preliminary investigation,” which suggests it was either not complete or that there was at least another investigation underway. Do you know?, A: Nothing suggests another investigation is underway. So, we suggest a further, more extensive inquiry is needed., Q: In the United States, western European countries, Australia, and Japan, a misconduct investigation of a scientist almost always leads to a thorough report that is made public. There has been nothing issued by the Guangdong Health Commission―nothing more than a press release given only to Xinhua—and your commentary did not call for any future report to be made public. Do you think these reports should be made public?, A: Of course, I think such reports should be made public. There seem to be no rules on whether and how to report the findings of investigations on cases of violating regulations. My colleagues and I have suggested to build a central registry on genome editing which is open access to the public. The registry could also be a platform where findings of investigations on cases of violating regulations are published., Q: Have any of you been asked to help with any investigations of He?, A: Immediately after the news was broke, the National Health Commission asked Xiaomei Zhai to go to Shenzhen to investigate the case―along with some commission officials. Zhai couldn’t go because she had to attend the Hong Kong summit. There were two occasions where I was invited by government think tanks to provide advice on He’s case. I suggested the government should make thorough investigation―especially any involvement of government officials and He’s colleagues and collaborators (both in China and the U.S.), including personnel at the IVF [in vitro fertilization] clinics―because He could not be the only person responsible for the incident. It’s unclear if any government officials were involved in the He incident in any way. But He certainly had ties with some governmental officials as his work on third-generation genome sequencing was prominently featured in a state television channel., Q: Your editorial calls for “rebooting” ethics governance. If any government officials or government-funded institutions supported or indicated approval of He’s germline editing in any way, are you confident that the Guangdong Health Commission’s investigation or any other investigation led by a government agency would transparently report this?, A: Sorry, I am afraid I am not in a position to answer this question. There has been no transparency regarding who the members of the investigation team are, which procedures they have followed, or what they have found. In general, I favor that the government puts together investigation teams that consist of independent experts. I don’t know if more investigation results will be disclosed, but I think the world deserves to know the truth. And I don’t think we can properly move on or prevent similar incidents from happening again until we know exactly what has happened., I don’t believe the government per se is involved. I have some contact with deputy ministry of National Health Commission and some officials at its Department of Science and Education, and I think they are not only honest persons, but also hold the view like our bioethicists in compliance with international guidelines. In many cases, they accepted our suggestions on drafting or revising relevant regulations. However, I cannot exclude some governmental officials in some departments at different levels being involved in it., Q: Do you think independence of the investigatory team is important? Is it possible in China?, A: For a bioethicist like me and many other scholars in China, that’s a given. Of course, the investigation should be both independent and transparent. I think it’s possible if China realizes the gravity of the matter. How China deals with it will determine the reputation and the future of the country and its scientific and bioethics communities.","origin":"News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/He_16x9_0.jpg?itok=dkW9lWyO","title":"Chinese bioethicists call for ‘reboot’ of biomedical regulation after country’s gene-edited baby scandal","authors":"Jon Cohen","pub_date":"May. 8, 2019 , 2:25 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/chinese-bioethicists-call-reboot-biomedical-regulation-after-country-s-gene-edited-baby"}]
