    "abstract_annotation": "Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) have been identified in certain high-latitude marine fish, insects and other terrestrial arthropods, and plants. Despite considerable structural variation, the mechanisms of their noncolligative antifreeze activity are probably quite similar. AFPs hydrogen bond onto the surface of potential seed ice crystals at preferred growth sites, thereby preventing growth of the crystals. AFPs from overwintering larvae of the beetle Dendroides canadensis are among the most active AFPs. These 8.7 kDa proteins consist of seven 12- or 13-mer repeating units. Their most striking feature is the location of cysteines every six residues throughout their length. Consequently, identification of the disulfide linkages of these cysteines is essential to understanding the structure of these AFPs. This study demonstrated that all of the 16 Cys residues in the Dendroides AFPs are disulfide bridged. All of the seven 12- or 13-mer repeats have internal disulfide bridges, and in all but the first repeat the Cys residues at positions 1 and 7 of the repeats are linked. In repeat 1 the Cys at position 1 is linked to the Cys at position 10, rather than the Cys at position 7 as in the other repeats, and the Cys at position 7 of the first repeat is linked to a Cys at position 4 of the second repeat. The disulfide bridges probably function to position the hydrophilic side chains of serine and threonine residues so that they hydrogen bond with ice",

    "abstract_annotation": "Like all terrestrial organisms, insect eggs face a tradeoff between exchanging metabolic gases (O(2) and CO(2)) and conserving water. Here I summarize the physiology underlying this tradeoff and the ecological contexts in which it may be important. The ideas are illustrated primarily by work from my laboratory on eggs of the sphingid moth Manduca sexta. In particular, I discuss: (1) dynamic changes in metabolic demand and water loss during development; and (2) how the eggshell layers and embryonic tracheal system control the traffic of gases between the embryo and its environment. Subsequently, I identify three areas with interesting but unresolved issues: (1) what eggs actually experience in their microclimates, focusing particularly on the leaf microclimates relevant to eggs of M. sexta; (2) how egg experience influences whether or not hatchling larvae succeed in establishing feeding sites on host plants; and (3) whether Hetz and Bradley's [Hetz, S.K., Bradley, T.J., 2005. Insects breathe discontinuously to avoid oxygen toxicity. Nature 433, 516-519] oxygen toxicity hypothesis for discontinuous gas-exchange cycles applies to insect eggs.",

Therefore, we have identified a physiological tradeoff between mating and immunity. Our results suggest that increasing mating success can result in increasing periods of immune suppression, which in turn implies that reproductively successful individuals may be more vulnerable to infection by, and the negative fitness effects of, pathogens.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Corticosterone is seasonally modulated in many passerines, with plasma Corticosterone concentrations lowest during the prebasic molt when all feathers are replaced. To explain why, we proposed that the birds down regulate natural Corticosterone release during molt in order to avoid Corticosterone's degradative effects on proteins and its inhibition of protein synthesis. If Corticosterone exerted these effects during molt, it could slow protein deposition during feather production and potentially result in a longer period of degraded flight performance. To test this hypothesis, either empty or Corticosterone-filled silastic implants were inserted into captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) undergoing induced (feather replacement after plucking) and natural molts. We then measured the rate of feather regrowth by regularly measuring the length of primary, secondary, and tail feathers. Corticosterone implanted birds showed a significantly decreased rate of feather growth compared to control animals. Basal Corticosterone concentrations of induced molt and non-molting birds were also compared but no difference was noted. The results suggest a tradeoff; a complete set of new feathers may be more important to the survival of a bird than the ability of Corticosterone to respond maximally to a stressor.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Movement speed is fundamental to all animal behaviour, yet no general framework exists for understanding why animals move at the speeds they do. Even during fitness-defining behaviours like running away from predators, an animal should select a speed that balances the benefits of high speed against the increased probability of mistakes. In this study, we explored this idea by quantifying trade-offs between speed, manoeuvrability and motor control in wild northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus) - a medium-sized carnivorous marsupial native to northern Australia. First, we quantified how running speed affected the probability of crashes when rounding corners of 45, 90 and 135 deg. We found that the faster an individual approached a turn, the higher the probability that they would crash, and these risks were greater when negotiating tighter turns. To avoid crashes, quolls modulated their running speed when they moved through turns of varying angles. Average speed for quolls when sprinting along a straight path was around 4.5 m s(-1) but this decreased linearly to speeds of around 1.5 m s(-1) when running through 135 deg turns. Finally, we explored how an individual's morphology affects their manoeuvrability. We found that individuals with larger relative foot sizes were more manoeuvrable than individuals with smaller relative foot sizes. Thus, movement speed, even during extreme situations like escaping predation, should be based on a compromise between high speed, manoeuvrability and motor control. We advocate that optimal - rather than maximal - performance capabilities underlie fitness-defining behaviours such as escaping predators and capturing prey.",

    "title_annotation": "Increased Toxicity of Karenia brevis during Phosphate Limited Growth: Ecological and Evolutionary Implications",
    "abstract_annotation": "Karenia brevis is the dominant toxic red tide algal species in the Gulf of Mexico. It produces potent neurotoxins (brevetoxins [PbTxs]), which negatively impact human and animal health, local economies, and ecosystem function. Field measurements have shown that cellular brevetoxin contents vary from 1-68 pg/cell but the source of this variability is uncertain. Increases in cellular toxicity caused by nutrient-limitation and inter-strain differences have been observed in many algal species. This study examined the effect of P-limitation of growth rate on cellular toxin concentrations in five Karenia brevis strains from different geographic locations. Phosphorous was selected because of evidence for regional P-limitation of algal growth in the Gulf of Mexico. Depending on the isolate, P-limited cells had 2.3- to 7.3-fold higher PbTx per cell than P-replete cells. The percent of cellular carbon associated with brevetoxins (%C-PbTx) was approximately 0.7 to 2.1% in P-replete cells, but increased to 1.6-5% under P-limitation. Because PbTxs are potent anti-grazing compounds, this increased investment in PbTxs should enhance cellular survival during periods of nutrient-limited growth. The %C-PbTx was inversely related to the specific growth rate in both the nutrient-replete and P-limited cultures of all strains. This inverse relationship is consistent with an evolutionary tradeoff between carbon investment in PbTxs and other grazing defenses, and C investment in growth and reproduction. In aquatic environments where nutrient supply and grazing pressure often vary on different temporal and spatial scales, this tradeoff would be selectively advantageous as it would result in increased net population growth rates. The variation in PbTx/cell values observed in this study can account for the range of values observed in the field, including the highest values, which are not observed under N-limitation. These results suggest P-limitation is an important factor regulating cellular toxicity and adverse impacts during at least some K. brevis blooms.",

We examined two leg extensors of a running cockroach to test the hypothesis that leg muscles within an anatomical muscle group necessarily manage (i.e. produce, store, transmit or absorb) energy similarly during running. Using electromyographic and video motion-analysis techniques, we determined that muscles 177c and 179 are both active during the first half of the stance period during muscle shortening. Using the in vivo strain and stimulation patterns determined during running, we measured muscle power output. Although both muscles were stimulated during the first half of shortening, muscle 177c generated mechanical energy (28Wkg\u20131) like a motor, while muscle 179 absorbed energy (\u201319Wkg\u20131) like a brake. Both muscles exhibited nearly identical intrinsic characteristics including similar twitch kinetics and force\u2013velocity relationships. Differences in the extrinsic factors of activation and relative shortening velocity caused the muscles to operate very differently during running. Presumed redundancy in a multiple muscle group may, therefore, represent diversity in muscle function. Discovering how muscles manage energy during behavior requires the measurement of a large number of dynamically interacting variables.  \n",

    "title_annotation": "Adaptive changes in prey vulnerability shape the response of predator populations to mortality",
    "abstract_annotation": "Simple models are used to explore how adaptive changes in prey vulnerability alter the population response of their predator to increased mortality. If the mortality is an imposed harvest, the change in prey vulnerability also influences the relationship between harvest effort and yield of the predator. The models assume that different prey phenotypes share a single resource, but have different vulnerabilities to the predator. Decreased vulnerability is assumed to decrease resource consumption rate. Adaptive change may occur by phenotypic changes in the traits of a single species or by shifts in the abundances of a pair of coexisting species or morphs. The response of the predator population is influenced by the shape of the predator's functional response, the shape of resource density dependence, and the shape of the tradeoff between vulnerability and food intake in the prey. Given a linear predator functional response, adaptive prey defense tends to produce a decelerating decline in predator population size with increased mortality. Prey defense may also greatly increase the range of mortality rates that allow predator persistence. If the predator has a type-2 response with a significant handling time, adaptive prey defense may have a greater variety of effects on the predator's response to mortality, sometimes producing alternative attractors, population cycles, or increased mean predator density. Situations in which there is disruptive selection on prey defense often imply a bimodal change in yield as a function of harvesting effort, with a minimum at intermediate effort. These results argue against using single-species models of density dependent growth to manage predatory species, and illustrate the importance of incorporating anti-predator behavior into models in applied population ecology.",

Strong correlations amongst traits previously defined as the leaf economics spectrum reflect a tradeoff between investments in productive leaves with rapid turnover vs. costly physical leaf structure with a long revenue stream. A second axis of variation, the 'stem economics spectrum', defines a similar tradeoff at the stem level: dense wood vs. high wood water content and thick bark. Most importantly, these two axes are orthogonal, suggesting that tradeoffs operate independently at the leaf and at the stem levels. By simplifying the multivariate ecological strategies of tropical trees into positions along these two spectra, our results provide a basis to improve global vegetation models predicting responses of tropical forests to global change.",

To test the existence of costs associated with inducible defense, we cultured S. obliquus along resource availability gradients in the presence or absence of infochemical cues from Daphnia, and measured the strength of defensive colony formation and fitness characters. Under the lowest phosphorous concentration, the expression of inducible defensive colony resulted in decreased growth rate, which provides direct evidence for physiological costs. Along the gradient reduction of phosphorous concentration or light intensity, inducible defense in S. obliquus showed a decreasing trend. However, the photosynthetic efficiency of S. obliquus was barely affected by its defense responses, suggesting that the negative correlations between resource availability and colony formation of this alga may be due to resource-based trade-offs in the allocation of limited resources. Thus, our results indicated that expression of inducible defense of S. obliquus was impaired under insufficient phosphorus or light. Furthermore, under severe phosphate deficiency, obvious physiological costs of inducible defense could be detected even though defensive colony formation also decreased significantly.",

We used radiotracer and endocrine approaches to investigate the extent to which morphs of a wing-polymorphic insect differ in the biosynthesis of lipid classes important for dispersal capability vs. reproduction (ovarian growth). The flight-capable genotype of Gryllus firmus biosynthesized a greater amount of total lipid and triglyceride (main flight fuel), which was preferentially allocated to somatic tissue during early adulthood. By contrast, the flightless genotype biosynthesized a significantly greater amount of phospholipid (important in egg development), which was preferentially allocated to ovaries. Topical application of a juvenile-hormone mimic to the flight-capable morph caused it to express all aspects of lipid metabolism seen in the flightless morph. Differences in biosynthesis between morphs (i) occur coincident with 100-400% greater ovarian growth in the flightless morph, (ii) result from alterations of both de novo biosynthesis of fatty acid and downstream partitioning of fatty acids into triglyceride vs. phospholipid, and (iii) possibly result from genetically polymorphic hormonal regulators with negative pleiotropic effects on lipid biosynthesis and ovarian growth.

    "abstract_annotation": "The evolution of encephalization requires that energetic challenges be met. Several hypotheses, such as the maternal energy and expensive tissue hypotheses, have been proposed to explain how some species are able to provide adequate energetic resources for large brains. The former incorporates maternal investment strategies, such as extended life history and elevated resting metabolic rate, which contribute to the growth of a large brain. The latter incorporates the reduction of gut size, which increases available energy for the maintenance of adult brain size. This study examines a sample of strepsirrhines, testing the hypothesis that encephalized species utilize some combination of the above-mentioned strategies. Infants and juveniles from three species at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) were measured periodically to arrive at head and body growth trajectories. These data were used to determine the energetic tradeoff among the offspring. The examination of gestation length, weaning age, intestinal size and resting metabolic rate was used to assess adult brain maintenance and maternal energetic contribution. The results reveal that Daubentonia, the most encephalized and thus human-like of the lemurs, does not experience an energetic trade-off between brain and body during ontogeny, but does exhibit a trade-off between extensive brain growth and possibly reduced intestinal growth. Also, maternal energy is utilized. Encephalized lemurs, such as Daubentonia, have higher resting metabolic rate, while encephalized lorisiforms have a longer period of gestation. These results demonstrate that there are several strategies for meeting the energetic demands of encephalization, and they can be manifested differentially across taxa.",

We characterized mechanisms of drought resistance in early and late-successional species and tested whether risk of drought differs across sites at different successional stages, and whether early and late-successional species differ in resistance to experimentally imposed soil drought. The microenvironment in early successional sites was warmer and drier than in mature forest. Nevertheless, successional groups did not differ in resistance to soil drought. Late-successional species resisted drought through two independent mechanisms: high resistance of xylem to embolism, or reliance on high stem water storage capacity. High sapwood water reserves delayed the effects of soil drying by transiently decoupling plant and soil water status. Resistance to soil drought resulted from the interplay between variations in xylem vulnerability to embolism, reliance on sapwood water reserves and leaf area reduction, leading to a tradeoff of avoidance against tolerance of soil drought, along which successional groups were not differentiated. Overall, our data suggest that ranking species' performance under soil drought based solely on xylem resistance to embolism may be misleading, especially for species with high sapwood water storage capacity.",

Decrease in xylem pressure during drought provoked a progressive collapse of tracheids below a specific threshold pressure (P(collapse)) that correlates with the onset of cavitation in the stems. P(collapse) was more negative for species with smaller tracheid diameter and thicker walls, suggesting a tradeoff between xylem efficiency, xylem vulnerability to collapse, and the cost of wall stiffening. Upon severe dehydration, tracheid walls were completely collapsed, but lumens still appeared filled with sap. When dehydration proceeded further, tracheids embolized and walls relaxed. Wall collapse in dehydrated needles was rapidly reversed upon rehydration.

Erecting the fur significantly increases pelt depth (6.5 mm) and coat resistance (79.2\u201364.2 s/m) at wind speeds between 0.5 m/s and 3 m/s. Numbat coat resistance is much lower than that of other marsupials, and wind speed has a greater influence on coat resistance for numbats than for other mammals, reflecting the low pelt density and thickness.  Solar heat gain by numbats through the pelt to the level of the skin (60\u201363%) is similar to the highest value measured for any mammal. However the numbat's high solar heat gain is not associated with the same degree of reduction in coat resistance as seen for other mammals, suggesting that its pelt has structural and spectral characteristics that enhance both solar heat acquisition and endogenous heat conservation. Maximum solar heat gain is estimated to be 0.5\u20133.6 times resting metabolic heat production for the numbat at ambient temperatures of 15\u201332.5�C, so radiative heat gain is probably an important aspect of thermoregulation for wild numbats.  \n",

    "abstract_annotation": "Mirrored and colored surfaces are common adaptations for crypsis in pelagic habitats. Although highly successful when optimized for a particular situation, either may become less successful if it is then viewed in a different situation. In this study we examine the relative robustness of these two strategies by determining how visible an organism becomes when viewed under optical conditions different from those under which the camouflage is optimal. Underwater radiance distributions were calculated using inherent optical properties measured in coastal waters 80 km off the coast of New Hampshire. These radiance distributions were then used to calculate optimally cryptic diffuse and specular reflectance spectra as a function of depth, solar elevation, viewing angle, and azimuth. Then the visibilities of organisms cryptic in one situation viewed in a different situation were calculated, using the Atlantic Cod, Gadus morhua, as the viewer. In contrast to benthic organisms, pelagic organisms cryptic under one set of optical conditions were quite visible under a different set, particularly when viewed from a different azimuth. The crypsis afforded by mirrored surfaces was generally more robust than that resulting from colored surfaces. However, because mirrored surfaces could never be perfectly cryptic when viewed in the azimuth of the sun, neither strategy clearly outperformed the other. In general, crypsis by colored or mirrored surfaces was not robust in near-surface water, which may help explain both the predominance of transparent species in near-surface pelagic habitats and the vertical migration of many colored and mirrored species. The results also show that three common foraging strategies-circling, crepuscular activity, and driving prey toward the surface-all increase the visibility of cryptically colored or mirrored prey.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Interspecific competition in natural plant communities is highly dependent on nutrient availability. At high levels of nutrient availability, competition is mainly for light. As light is a unidirectional resource, high-nutrient habitats are dominated by fast-growing perennials with a tall stature and a rather uniform vertical distribution of leaf area. Moreover, these species have high turnover rates of leaves and roots and a high morphological plasticity during the differentiation of leaves. There is less consensus, however, about the importance and intensity of interspecific competition in nutrient-poor environments. It is argued that selection in nutrient-poor habitats is not necessarily on a high competitive ability for nutrients and a high growth rate, but rather on traits which reduce nutrient losses (low tissue nutrient concentrations, slow tissue turnover rates, high nutrient resorption efficiency). Due to evolutionary trade-offs plants can not maximize both growth rate and nutrient retention. Thus, the low growth rate of species from nutrient-poor habitats should be considered as the consequence of nutrient retention rather than as a feature on which direct selection takes place. The contrasting traits of species from nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich habitats mutually exclude them from each others' habitats. Moreover, these traits have severe consequences for litter decomposability and thereby also for nutrient cycling. This leads both in nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich habitats to a positive feedback between plant species dominance and nutrient availability, thereby promoting ecosystem stability.",

Karst.) trunkwood with different anatomical and hydraulic properties. Hydraulically less safe mature sapwood had bigger hydraulic lumen diameters and higher specific hydraulic conductivities than hydraulically safer juvenile wood. Bending stiffness (MOE) was higher, whereas radial compression strength lower in mature than in juvenile wood. A density-based tradeoff between MOE and hydraulic efficiency was apparent in mature wood only. Across cambial age, bending stiffness did not compromise hydraulic efficiency due to variation in latewood percent and because of the structural demands of the tree top (e.g. high flexibility). Radial compression strength compromised, however, hydraulic efficiency because it was extremely dependent on the characteristics of the \\weakest\\ wood part, the highly conductive earlywood. An increase in conduit wall reinforcement of earlywood tracheids would be too costly for the tree. Increasing radial compression strength by modification of microfibril angles or ray cell number could result in a decrease of MOE, which would negatively affect the trunk's capability to support the crown. We propose that radial compression strength could be an easily assessable and highly predictive parameter for the resistance against implosion or vulnerability to cavitation across conifer species, which should be topic of further studies.",

Here, a testosterone-mediated trade-off in the carotenoid allocation between colour expression and the fight against oxidative stress is proposed. Male red-legged partridges were treated with testosterone, anti-androgens or manipulated as controls. Testosterone-treated males maintained the highest circulating carotenoid levels, but showed the palest red traits and no evidence of oxidative damage. Increased levels of a key intracellular antioxidant (i.e. glutathione) indicated that an oxidative challenge was in fact induced but controlled. The trade-off was apparently solved by reducing redness, allowing increased carotenoid availability, which could have contributed to buffer oxidative stress.",

Freshwater snails with translucent shells, e.g.  Radix spp, differ considerably in their mantle pigmentation patterns, with snails from the same water body ranging from being completely dark pigmented to having only a few dark patterns. These pigmentation differences have previously been suggested to be genetically fixed, but we propose that this polymorphism is owing to phenotypic plasticity in response to a fluctuating environment. Hence, we here aimed to assess whether common stressors, including ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and predation, induce a plastic response in mantle pigmentation patterns of Radix balthica. We show, in contrast to previous studies, that snails are plastic in their expression of mantle pigmentation in response to changes in UVR and predator threats, i.e. differences among populations are not genetically fixed. When exposed to cues from visually hunting fish, R. balthica increased the proportion of their dark pigmentation, suggesting a crypsis strategy. Snails increased their pigmentation even further in response to UVR, but this also led to a reduction in pattern complexity. Furthermore, when exposed to UVR and fish simultaneously, snails responded in the same way as in the UVR treatment, suggesting a trade-off between photoprotection and crypsis.",

    "abstract_annotation": "BACKGROUND: Vision in starlight relies on our ability to detect single absorbed photons. Indeed, the sensitivity of dark-adapted vision approaches limits set by the quantal nature of light. This sensitivity requires neural mechanisms that selectively transmit quantal responses and suppress noise. Such mechanisms face an inevitable tradeoff because signal and noise cannot be perfectly separated, and rejecting noise also means rejecting signal. RESULTS: We report measurements of single-photon responses in the output signals of the primate retina. We find that visual signals arising from a few absorbed photons are read out fundamentally differently by primate On and Off parasol ganglion cells, key retinal output neurons. Off parasol cells respond linearly to near-threshold flashes, retaining sensitivity to each absorbed photon but maintaining a high level of noise. On parasol cells respond nonlinearly due to thresholding of their excitatory synaptic inputs. This nonlinearity reduces neural noise but also limits information about single-photon absorptions. CONCLUSIONS: The long-standing idea that information about each photon absorption is available for behavior at the sensitivity limit of vision is not universally true across retinal outputs. More generally, our work shows how a neural circuit balances the competing needs for sensitivity and noise rejection.",

Using this approach, we identified the Drosophila melanogaster gene takeout. takeout is upregulated in a variety of long-lived flies, and extends life span when overexpressed. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of takeout-dependent longevity. takeout overexpression specifically in the fat body is sufficient to increase fly longevity and is additive to the longevity effects of Dietary Restriction. takeout long-lived flies do not show phenotypes often associated with increased longevity, such as enhanced stress resistance or major metabolic abnormalities. However, males exhibit greatly diminished courtship behavior, leading to a reduction in fertility. Interestingly, takeout contains a binding domain for Juvenile Hormone, a fly hormone that plays a role in the regulation of developmental transitions. Importantly, the longevity and courtship phenotypes of takeout overexpressing flies are reversed by treatment with the Juvenile Hormone analog methoprene. These data suggest that takeout is a key player in the tradeoff-switch between fertility and longevity. takeout may control fertility via modulation of courtship behavior. This regulation may occur through Juvenile Hormone binding to takeout and a subsequent reduction in Juvenile Hormone signaling activity.",

We assessed genetic and cultural contributions to song in a species where social association was not strongly correlated with kinship: the cooperatively breeding, reproductively promiscuous splendid fairy-wren (Malurus splendens). We found that song characters of socially associated father-son pairs were more strongly correlated (and thus songs were more similar) than songs of father-son pairs with a genetic, but no social, association (i.e. cuckolding fathers). Song transmission was, therefore, vertical and cultural, with minimal signatures of kinship. Additionally, song characters were not correlated with several phenotypic indicators of male quality, supporting the idea that there may be a tradeoff between accurate copying of tutors and quality signalling via maximizing song performance, particularly when social and genetic relationships are decoupled.

Here, we consider a mechanistic explanation, that the slower-growing species invested relatively more resources to storage. We compared the relative levels of root storage compounds between eight monocarpic species using metabolomic profiling, and characterized plant growth using a size-corrected estimate of relative growth rate (RGR). Growth rate was negatively correlated with the proportional allocation of root metabolites identified as sucrose, raffinose and stachyose and with amino acids known for their roles in nitrogen storage, particularly proline and arginine. The total amount and concentration of energy-corrected carbohydrates were also negatively correlated with RGR. Our results show for the first time that slower-growing species invest proportionally more of their total root metabolites in carbon- and nitrogen-storage compounds. We conclude that the increased investment in these reserves is an important resource allocation strategy underlying the growth-survival trade-off in plants.",

What remains unknown is the relative costs of different defensive traits and how prey reconcile investment into these traits when energetically limited. We tested the simple allocation model of prey defense, which predicts an additive effect of increasing predation risk and resource availability, resulting in the full deployment of defensive traits under conditions of high risk and resource saturation. We collected morphometric, developmental, and behavioural data in an experiment using dragonfly larvae (predator) and Northern leopard frog tadpoles (prey) subject to variable levels of food availability and predation risk. Larvae exposed to food restriction showed limited response to predation risk; larvae at food saturation altered behaviour, development, and growth in response to predation risk. Responses to risk varied through time, suggesting ontogeny may affect the deployment of particular defensive traits. The observed negative correlation between body size and activity level for food-restricted prey--and the absence of a similar response among adequately-fed prey--suggests that a trade-off exists between behavioural and growth responses when energy budgets are limited. Our research is the first to demonstrate how investment into these defensive traits is mediated along gradients of both predation risk and resource availability over time. The interactions we demonstrate between resource availability and risk level on deployment of inducible defenses provide evidence that both internal condition and extrinsic risk factors play a critical role in the production of inducible defenses over time.",

One key physiological pathway likely to contribute to the partitioning of resources is the vertebrate stress response. By increasing circulating glucocorticoids the stress response can exert a suite of physiological effects, such as altering immune function. We investigated the effects of stress physiology on individual immunity, reproduction and oxidative stress, across an urban landscape. We sampled populations in and around St. George, Utah, examining corticosterone in response to restraint stress, two innate immune measures, reproductive output, and the presence of both reactive oxygen metabolites and antioxidant binding capacity, in populations of common side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana) experiencing variable levels of environmental stress. Additionally, using capture-mark-recapture techniques, we examined the relationships between these physiological parameters and population-level differences. Our results reveal elevated physiological stress corresponds with suppressed immunity and increased oxidative stress. Interestingly, urban populations experiencing the most physiological stress also exhibited greater reproductive output and decreased survival relative to rural populations experiencing less physiological stress, demonstrating a tradeoff between reproduction and life maintenance processes. Our results suggest that environmental stress may augment life history strategy in this fast-paced species, and that shifts in life history strategy can in turn affect the population at large. Finally, the urban environment poses definite challenges for organisms, and while it appears that side-blotched lizards are adjusting physiologically, it is unknown what fitness costs these physiological adjustments accrue.",

Using the socially flexible African striped mouse, we tested through a series of dyadic encounters in a neutral arena whether group-living mice that later became solitary differed from their philopatric conspecifics. We compared philopatric and solitary mice both before and after dispersal. We predicted striped mice that became solitary would be more aggressive, less amicable and more investigative than individuals that remained group living, and would change their social behaviour after changing from group to solitary living in the same direction (becoming more aggressive, etc.). Dyadic encounters were conducted on 42 group-living individuals and 13 individuals that were first group living and later became solitary. Striped mice that became solitary showed higher levels of aggression and social investigation than their conspecifics that remained group living, differences that were already present before individuals dispersed. Dispersing striped mice showed a negative correlation between amicability and aggression towards opposite-sex individuals, which could be linked to sexual motivation. A second behavioural syndrome in the form of a positive correlation between aggression and social investigation towards same-sex individuals might have indicated that dispersing striped mice were ready to defend their own territory. Our study provides evidence that within the same population and at the same time, individuals that disperse and become solitary differ behaviourally from their group-living conspecifics even before dispersal, and further change their behaviour after dispersal in an evolutionarily adaptive way.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Many parasites depress the expression of the carotenoid-based colour displays of their hosts, and it has been hypothesized that animals face a trade-off in carotenoid allocation between immune functions and 'degree of ornamentation'. While numerous correlative studies suggest that parasite infection decreases the intensity of carotenoid-based colour displays, the existence of this trade-off has never been demonstrated experimentally in a host-parasite model. In this study, we used the blackbird (Turdus merula) and Isospora (an intestinal parasite) to assess whether this trade-off does indeed exist. Blackbirds were supplemented with carotenoids while simultaneously being exposed to parasites. Supplemented males circulated more carotenoids in the blood and developed more brightly coloured bills than unsupplemented males. In addition, supplementation slowed down the replication rate of parasites. Supplementation with carotenoids enabled infected birds to maintain their bill coloration, whereas birds that were infected but not supplemented showed reduced bill coloration. At the same time, infection slowed carotenoid assimilation in the blood. Overall, we demonstrated that bill colour reflects a bird's health, and that only males with a carotenoid-rich diet are capable of coping with costs associated with parasitic infection. Carotenoids are thus traded off between host physiological response to parasites and secondary sexual traits. Further investigations are required to determine the physiological mechanisms that govern this trade-off.",

    "abstract_annotation": "In species with reduced locomotory abilities, camouflage seems to be far more important than other behavioural tactics (e.g. running) to elude predatory attacks. In this study, we examined the effects of camouflage on escape decisions in the common chameleon Chamaeleo chamaeleon. The effectiveness of camouflage was assessed by the ability of humans to detect different sized chameleons placed on different backgrounds (vegetation of high and low density, defined here as open and dense bushes), both in the field and in photographs. Escape behaviour was analysed by simulating a predator attack (in our case, approach by a human). As expected, the probability of detection by a potential predator was size- and background dependent. in the field, detection time (but not distance) was significantly higher for chameleons of a given size perched on dense (myoporum) than open (Retama) bushes. When using photographs, the probability of detection was higher for large (adult) chameleons perched on open (Retama or Nerium) bushes and lower for hatchlings perched on dense (myoporum or cupressus) bushes. Conspicuousness greatly influenced the escape tactics of individuals. chameleons perched on more protected myoporum allowed closest approach than those perched on less protected retama. In general, antipredatory responses (defined here as \u2018first movement\u2019, \u2018fleeing\u2019, \u2018mouth opening\u2019 or \u2018free falling\u2019) occurred significantly earlier in the trial sequence in chameleons perched on clear Retama than those perched in myoporum. Two antipredatory responses were size-dependent: juveniles and adults exhibited \u2018mouth opening\u2019 more frequently than hatchlings whereas \u2018free falling\u2019 was more frequently recorded for hatchlings. Our results suggest that size and vegetation greatly influence the risk of detection by predators and this variation influences an individual\u2019s decision about when and how to escape.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Evolutionary biologists increasingly recognize that evolution can be constrained by trade-offs, yet our understanding of how and when such constraints are manifested and whether they restrict adaptive divergence in populations remains limited. Here, we show that spatial heterogeneity in moisture maintains a polymorphism for pungency (heat) among natural populations of wild chilies (Capsicum chacoense) because traits influencing water-use efficiency are functionally integrated with traits controlling pungency (the production of capsaicinoids). Pungent and non-pungent chilies occur along a cline in moisture that spans their native range in Bolivia, and the proportion of pungent plants in populations increases with greater moisture availability. In high moisture environments, pungency is beneficial because capsaicinoids protect the fruit from pathogenic fungi, and is not costly because pungent and non-pungent chilies grown in well-watered conditions produce equal numbers of seeds. In low moisture environments, pungency is less beneficial as the risk of fungal infection is lower, and carries a significant cost because, under drought stress, seed production in pungent chilies is reduced by 50 per cent relative to non-pungent plants grown in identical conditions. This large difference in seed production under water-stressed (WS) conditions explains the existence of populations dominated by non-pungent plants, and appears to result from a genetic correlation between pungency and stomatal density: non-pungent plants, segregating from intra-population crosses, exhibit significantly lower stomatal density (p = 0.003), thereby reducing gas exchange under WS conditions. These results demonstrate the importance of trait integration in constraining adaptive divergence among populations.",

Initially, diploid populations did not pay this cost of adaptation but haploidized after about 1000-3000 generations of selection, and this ploidy transition was associated with a decline in yield caused by reduced cell size.

    "abstract_annotation": "Human vision is approximately 10 times less sensitive than toad vision on a cool night. Here, we investigate (1) how far differences in the capacity for temporal integration underlie such differences in sensitivity and (2) whether the response kinetics of the rod photoreceptors can explain temporal integration at the behavioral level. The toad was studied as a model that allows experimentation at different body temperatures. Sensitivity, integration time, and temporal accuracy of vision were measured psychophysically by recording snapping at worm dummies moving at different velocities. Rod photoresponses were studied by ERG recording across the isolated retina. In both types of experiments, the general timescale of vision was varied by using two temperatures, 15 and 25 degrees C. Behavioral integration times were 4.3 s at 15 degrees C and 0.9 s at 25 degrees C, and rod integration times were 4.2-4.3 s at 15 degrees C and 1.0-1.3 s at 25 degrees C. Maximal behavioral sensitivity was fivefold lower at 25 degrees C than at 15 degrees C, which can be accounted for by inability of the \\warm\\ toads to integrate light over longer times than the rods. However, the long integration time at 15 degrees C, allowing high sensitivity, degraded the accuracy of snapping toward quickly moving worms. We conclude that temporal integration explains a considerable part of all variation in absolute visual sensitivity. The strong correlation between rods and behavior suggests that the integration time of dark-adapted vision is set by rod phototransduction at the input to the visual system. This implies that there is an inexorable trade-off between temporal integration and resolution.",

    "title_annotation": "Ecological modulation of plant defense via phytochrome control of jasmonate sensitivity",
    "abstract_annotation": "For plants, the tradeoff between resource investment in defense and increased growth to out-compete neighbors creates an allocation dilemma. How plants resolve this dilemma, at the mechanistic level, is unclear. We found that Arabidopsis plants produced an attenuated defense phenotype under conditions of crowding and when exposed to far-red (FR) radiation, a light signal that plants use to detect the proximity of neighbors via the photoreceptor phytochrome. This phenotype was detectable through standard bioassays that measured the growth of Spodoptera frugiperda caterpillars. Two possible explanations for the effect of FR are: (i) a simple by-product of the diversion of resources to competition, and (ii) a specific effect of phytochrome on defense signaling. The first possibility was ruled out by the fact that the auxin-deficient sav3 mutant, which fails to induce growth responses to FR, still responded to FR with an attenuated defense phenotype. In support of the second hypothesis, we found that phytochrome inactivation by FR caused a strong reduction of plant sensitivity to jasmonates, which are key regulators of plant immunity. The effects of FR on jasmonate sensitivity were restricted to certain elements of the pathway. Supporting the idea that the FR effects on jasmonate signaling are functionally significant, we found that FR failed to increase tissue quality in jar1, a mutant impaired in jasmonate response. We conclude that the plant modulates its investment in defense as a function of the perceived risk of competition, and that this modulation is effected by phytochrome via selective desensitization to jasmonates.",

    "abstract_annotation": "The surprising incidence of nonlethal skeletal fractures implies that many organisms operate near their upper performance limits, yet we know little about the loads at which biological structures break or about the material properties of those structures. In addition, biologically realistic estimates of how closely normal maximal loads approach breaking strengths (i.e., safety factors) remain elusive. We measured cuticular breaking strength (a material property) and safety factors (breaking force/maximum biting force) for intact claws of six species of predatory Cancer crabs (Crustacea, Brachyura). Cuticular breaking stresses in Cancer claws (40-120 MN m -2) exceeded those reported for the carapace of shore crabs (Carcinus) and swimming crabs (Scylla), but were similar to published values for the claws of stone crabs (Menippe). Cuticular breaking strength increased towards the tip of the pollex (fixed finger), correlated with visible changes in the claw cuticle, but decreased with increasing claw size. Safety factors of the pollex varied within and among Cancer species and ranged from 2 to 7. Safety factors increased with increasing claw size (ocmanus length), due to proportionally thicker cuticle (ocmanus length 1.31 ~O.078) and proportionally lower maximum biting forces (ocmanus length 1.49~O.082). Why larger crabs have proportionally lower biting forces remains an important unsolved problem. The higher safety factors of larger claws appear adaptive, however, since costs of failure and unpredictability of cuticle strength increase with increasing size. Patterns of intraspecific size-dependence offer an attractive test of whether safety factors vary adaptively. A brief review of the literature suggests that positive size-dependence often signals adaptive variation in safety factors, whereas negative size-dependence may signal the action of constraints on growth or form.",

Despite over a century of research on the evolution of brain size, empirical support for the trade-off between cognitive ability and energetic costs is based exclusively on correlative evidence, and the theory remains controversial. Here we provide experimental evidence for costs and benefits of increased brain size. We used artificial selection for large and small brain size relative to body size in a live-bearing fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), and found that relative brain size evolved rapidly in response to divergent selection in both sexes. Large-brained females outperformed small-brained females in a numerical learning assay designed to test cognitive ability. Moreover, large-brained lines, especially males, developed smaller guts, as predicted by the expensive-tissue hypothesis, and produced fewer offspring. We propose that the evolution of brain size is mediated by a functional trade-off between increased cognitive ability and reproductive performance and discuss the implications of these findings for vertebrate brain evolution.",

Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) exhibit larger caudal regions and higher burst-swimming capabilities when coexisting with higher densities of predatory fish. It is hypothesized that a trade-off between steady (constant-speed cruising; important for acquiring resources) and unsteady (rapid bursts and turns; important for escaping predators) locomotion, combined with divergent selection on locomotor performance (favouring steady swimming in high-competition scenarios of low-predation environments, but unsteady swimming in high-predation localities) has caused such phenotypic divergence. Here, I found that morphological differences had a strong genetic basis, and low-predation fish required less hydromechanical power during steady swimming, leading to increased endurance. I further found individual-level support for cause-and-effect relationships between morphology, swimming kinematics and endurance. Results indicate that mosquitofish populations inhabiting low-predation environments have evolved increased steady-swimming abilities via stiffer bodies, larger anterior body/head regions, smaller caudal regions and greater three-dimensional streamlining.",

These range from expected differences in genes involved in reproductive physiology to those involved in amino acid utilization, sensory perception, immune response, and growth control. A striking difference was observed in purine and the tightly interconnected folate metabolism upon protein starvation.

Glue contributes little to the tensile strength of the capture spiral it decorates. However, viscid silk utilizes a unique suspension bridge mechanism which increases stickiness by recruiting the adhesion of multiple glue droplets.  The force required to break capture spiral fibers explains about 90% of the variation in stickiness among orb spiders. Stickiness increases linearly with capture spiral strength, but with a significant safety factor because stickiness is always less than the force required to break the silk.  Evolutionary changes in the stickiness of the capture spiral are largely constrained by the strength of the fiber the glue is placed on rather than by the chemistry of the glue itself. This implies that orb webs function optimally when threads are able to detach and adhere repeatedly to struggling prey.",

We used a comparative phylogenetic approach to examine a previously untested hypothesis (Recombination-Mating System Hypothesis) that posits that reduced sexual reproduction limits adaptive evolution of plant defenses against arthropod herbivores. To test this hypothesis we focused on the evening primrose family (Onagraceae), which includes both sexual and functionally asexual species. Ancestral state reconstructions on a 5-gene phylogeny of the family revealed between 18 and 21 independent transitions between sexual and asexual reproduction. Based on these analyses, we examined susceptibility to herbivores on 32 plant species representing 15 independent transitions. Generalist caterpillars consumed 32% more leaf tissue, gained 13% greater mass, and experienced 21% higher survival on functionally asexual than on sexual plant species. Survival of a generalist feeding mite was 19% higher on asexual species. In a field experiment, generalist herbivores consumed 64% more leaf tissue on asexual species. By contrast, a specialist beetle fed more on sexual than asexual species, suggesting that a tradeoff exists between the evolution of defense to generalist and specialist herbivores. Measures of putative plant defense traits indicate that both secondary compounds and physical leaf characteristics may mediate this tradeoff. These results support the Recombination-Mating System Hypothesis and suggest that variation in sexual reproduction among plant species may play an important, yet overlooked, role in shaping the macroevolution of plant defenses against arthropod herbivores.",

Here we provide, to our knowledge, the first rigorous experimental test of this hypothesis, and find dramatic changes in lifespan in the predicted direction in response to both upward and downward manipulations of growth rates. We used brief (less than 4% of median lifespan) exposure to relatively cold or warm temperatures early in life to deflect juvenile three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus from their normal growth trajectories; this induced catch-up or slowed-down growth when ambient temperatures were restored, and all groups attained the same average adult size. Catch-up growth led to a reduction in median lifespan of 14.5 per cent, while slowed-down growth extended lifespan by 30.6 per cent. These lifespan effects were independent of eventual size attained or reproductive investment in adult life. Photoperiod manipulations showed that the effects of compensatory growth on lifespan were also influenced by time available for growth prior to breeding, being more extreme when less time was available. These results demonstrate the growth-lifespan trade-off. While growing more slowly can increase longevity, the optimal resolution of the growth-lifespan trade-off is influenced by time constraints in a seasonal environment.",

In particular, we tested a hypothesis that the Mandarin Chinese and American English are similar in showing logarithmic dependences between speech time and index of difficulty (ID), while they differ significantly in the amount of time needed to describe simple pictures, this difference increases for more complex pictures, and it is associated with a proportional difference in the number of syllables used. Subjects (eight Chinese speakers and eight English speakers) were tested in pairs. One subject (the Speaker) described simple pictures, while the other subject (the Performer) tried to reproduce the pictures based on the verbal description as quickly as possible with a set of objects. The Chinese speakers initiated speech production significantly faster than the English speakers. Speech time scaled linearly with ln(ID) in all subjects, but the regression coefficient was significantly higher in the English speakers as compared with the Chinese speakers. The number of errors was somewhat lower in the Chinese participants (not significantly). The Chinese pairs also showed a shorter delay between the initiation of speech and initiation of action by the Performer, shorter movement time by the Performer, and shorter overall performance time. The number of syllables scaled with ID, and the Chinese speakers used significantly smaller numbers of syllables. Speech rate was comparable between the two groups, about 3 syllables/s; it dropped for more complex pictures (higher ID). When asked to reproduce the same pictures without speaking, movement time scaled linearly with ln(ID); the Chinese performers were slower than the English performers. We conclude that natural languages show a speed-difficulty trade-off similar to Fitts' law; the trade-offs in movement and speech production are likely to originate at a cognitive level. The time advantage of the Chinese participants originates not from similarity of the simple pictures and Chinese written characters and not from more sloppy performance.

We have analyzed the subtle physical mechanism responsible for drop transport and demonstrated experimentally that the beak geometry and the dynamics of tweezering may be tuned to optimize transport efficiency. We also highlight the critical dependence of the capillary ratchet on the beak's wetting properties, thus making clear the vulnerability of capillary feeders to surface pollutants.",

This stiff yet tough behavior is desirable for both medical and military applications but it is difficult to reproduce in engineering materials. While the nonlinear hyperelastic behavior of fibrous networks has been extensively studied, the understanding of toughness is still incomplete. Here, we identify a microstructure mimicking the branched bundles of a natural type I collagen network, in which partially cross-linked long fibers give rise to novel combinations of stiffness and toughness. Finite element analysis shows that the stiffness of fully cross-linked fibrous networks is amplified by increasing the fibril length and cross-link density. However, a trade-off of such stiff networks is reduced toughness. By having partially cross-linked networks with long fibrils, the networks have comparable stiffness and improved toughness as compared to the fully cross-linked networks. Further, the partially cross-linked networks avoid the formation of kinks, which cause fibril rupture during deformation. As a result, the branching allows the networks to have stiff yet tough behavior.^^rdfs:Literal",

    "abstract_annotation": "Several prominent hypotheses have been posed to explain the immense variability among plant species in defense against herbivores. A major concept in the evolutionary ecology of plant defenses is that tradeoffs of defense strategies are likely to generate and maintain species diversity. In particular, tradeoffs between constitutive and induced resistance and tradeoffs relating these strategies to growth and competitive ability have been predicted. We performed three independent experiments on 58 plant species from 15 different plant families to address these hypotheses in a phylogenetic framework. Because evolutionary tradeoffs may be altered by human-imposed artificial selection, we used 18 wild plant species and 40 cultivated garden-plant species. Across all 58 plant species, we demonstrate a tradeoff between constitutive and induced resistance, which was robust to accounting for phylogenetic history of the species. Moreover, the tradeoff was driven by wild species and was not evident for cultivated species. In addition, we demonstrate that more competitive species-but not fast growing ones-had lower constitutive but higher induced resistance. Thus, our multispecies experiments indicate that the competition-defense tradeoff holds for constitutive resistance and is complemented by a positive relationship of competitive ability with induced resistance. We conclude that the studied genetically determined tradeoffs are indeed likely to play an important role in shaping the high diversity observed among plant species in resistance against herbivores and in life history traits.",

Integration of these movements over time will lead to a weeping habit unless gravitropic correction occurs. This correction is achieved by asymmetric internal forces induced during the maturation of new wood. The long-term stability of a growing stem therefore depends on how the gravitropic correction that is generated by diametric growth balances the disturbance due to increasing self weight. The balance between the correction and the disturbance depends on the efficiency of the gravitropic correction, which depends on the asymmetry of wood maturation strain, eccentric growth, and gradients in wood stiffness. The necessity for gravitropic correction might constrain allometric growth of the stem.  Gravitropic performance limits the increase in height of tilted stem and branches. The performance of this function may thus limit the slenderness and lean of stems, and therefore the ability of the tree to capture light in a heterogeneous environment.",

While more negative xylem water potentials provide a larger driving force for water transport, they also cause cavitation that limits hydraulic conductivity. An optimum balance between driving force and cavitation occurs at intermediate water potentials, thus defining the maximum transpiration rate the xylem can sustain (denoted as E(max)). The presence of this maximum raises the question as to whether plants regulate transpiration through stomata to function near E(max). To address this question, we calculated E(max) across plant functional types and climates using a hydraulic model and a global database of plant hydraulic traits. The predicted E(max) compared well with measured peak transpiration across plant sizes and growth conditions and was relatively conserved among plant types (for a given plant size), while increasing across climates following the atmospheric evaporative demand. The fact that E(max) was roughly conserved across plant types and scales with the product of xylem saturated conductivity and water potential at 50% cavitation was used here to explain the safety-efficiency trade-off in plant xylem. Stomatal conductance allows maximum transpiration rates despite partial cavitation in the xylem thereby suggesting coordination between stomatal regulation and xylem hydraulic characteristics.",

We trained macaque monkeys to trade speed for accuracy on cue during visual search and recorded the activity of neurons in the frontal eye field. Unpredicted by any model, we discovered that speed-accuracy tradeoff is accomplished through several distinct adjustments. Visually responsive neurons modulated baseline firing rate, sensory gain, and the duration of perceptual processing. Movement neurons triggered responses with activity modulated in a direction opposite of model predictions. Thus, current stochastic accumulator models provide an incomplete description of the neural processes accomplishing speed-accuracy tradeoffs.

Photoassimilates are required for defensive compounds and carbon storage below ground and may therefore be depleted or enriched in the roots of herbivore-defoliated plants. The potential role of belowground tissues as mediators of induced tolerance-defense trade-offs is unknown. We evaluated signaling and carbohydrate dynamics in the roots of Nicotiana attenuata following Manduca sexta attack. Experimental and natural genetic variability was exploited to link the observed metabolite patterns to plant tolerance and resistance. Leaf-herbivore attack decreased sugar and starch concentrations in the roots and reduced regrowth from the rootstock and flower production in the glasshouse and the field. Leaf-derived jasmonates were identified as major regulators of this root-mediated resource-based trade-off: lower jasmonate levels were associated with decreased defense, increased carbohydrate levels and improved regrowth from the rootstock. Application and transport inhibition experiments, in combination with silencing of the sucrose non-fermenting (SNF) -related kinase GAL83, indicated that auxins may act as additional signals that regulate regrowth patterns. In conclusion, our study shows that the ability to mobilize defenses has a hidden resource-based cost below ground that constrains defoliation tolerance.

Traditionally, speed-accuracy tradeoffs (SATs) have been almost exclusively ascribed to changes in the amount of sensory evidence required to support a response (\\response caution\\) and the neural correlates associated with the later stages of decision making (e.g., motor response generation and execution). Here, we investigated whether performance decrements under speed pressure also reflect suboptimal information processing in early sensory areas such as primary visual cortex (V1). Human subjects performed an orientation discrimination task while emphasizing either response speed or accuracy. A model of choice behavior revealed that the rate of sensory evidence accumulation was selectively modulated when subjects emphasized accuracy, but not speed, suggesting that changes in sensory processing also influence the SAT. We then used fMRI and a forward encoding model to derive orientation-selective tuning functions based on activation patterns in V1. When accuracy was emphasized, the extent to which orientation-selective tuning profiles exhibited a theoretically optimal gain pattern predicted both response accuracy and the rate of sensory evidence accumulation. However, these relationships were not observed when subjects emphasized speed. Collectively, our findings suggest that, in addition to lowered response thresholds, the performance decrements observed during speeded decision making may result from a failure to optimally process sensory signals.",

A meniscus surrounding the area of contact shows that pad and surface are connected by a fluid-filled joint. The pads exhibit the velocity-dependent resistance to shear forces expected of any system employing a fluid as an adhesive mechanism.  The largest adhesive forces that toe pads can generate (approx. 1.2 mN/mm2, calculated from data on sticking ability) are within the range that can be produced by wet adhesion. \nBoth viscous forces and surface tension (the two components of wet adhesion) are likely to play significant roles in the tree frog's adhesive mechanism.  The toe pads are detached from surfaces by peeling, the pads being removed from the rear forwards during forward locomotion up a vertical surface. When the frogs walk backwards down a vertical slope, the front of the pad peeled to the rear. During forward locomotion up a vertical slope, this peeling is not accompanied by any detectable detachment forces. Such forces of detachment are seen, however, during backward walking down the slope and when belly skin comes into contact with the platform. That peeling occurs automatically during forward locomotion is supported both by observations of peeling in single toe pads of anaesthetised frogs and by the inability of frogs to adhere to vertical surfaces in a head-down orientation. Indeed, frogs on a rotating vertical surface were observed to adjust their orientations back towards the vertical whenever their deviation from the vertical reached 85.1 {+/-}21.5{degrees}. During forward locomotion peeling seems to occur as a natural consequence of the way in which the toes are lifted off surfaces from the rear forwards, while during backward locomotion it is an active process involving the distal tendons of the toes.  \n",

Previous research has suggested that the size and topology of the gene network underlying a quantitative trait should constrain or facilitate adaptation and thereby alter population dynamics. Here, I consider a scenario in which two species with different genetic architectures compete and evolve in fluctuating environments. An important trade-off emerges between adaptive accuracy and adaptive speed, driven by the size of the gene network underlying the ecologically-critical trait and the rate of environmental change. Smaller, scale-free networks confer a competitive advantage in rapidly-changing environments, but larger networks permit increased adaptive accuracy when environmental change is sufficiently slow to allow a species time to adapt. As the differences in network characteristics increase, the time-to-resolution of competition decreases. These results augment and refine previous conclusions about the ecological implications of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits, emphasizing a role of adaptive accuracy. Along with previous work, in particular that considering the role of gene network connectivity, these results provide a set of expectations for what we may observe as the field of ecological genomics develops.",

However, since most mutations are destabilizing (DeltaDeltaG>0), one should ask how destabilizing mutations that confer new or altered enzymatic functions relative to all other mutations are. We applied DeltaDeltaG computations by FoldX to analyze the effects of 548 mutations that arose from the directed evolution of 22 different enzymes. The stability effects, location, and type of function-altering mutations were compared to DeltaDeltaG changes arising from all possible point mutations in the same enzymes. We found that mutations that modulate enzymatic functions are mostly destabilizing (average DeltaDeltaG = +0.9 kcal/mol), and are almost as destabilizing as the \\average\\ mutation in these enzymes (+1.3 kcal/mol). Although their stability effects are not as dramatic as in key catalytic residues, mutations that modify the substrate binding pockets, and thus mediate new enzymatic specificities, place a larger stability burden than surface mutations that underline neutral, non-adaptive evolutionary changes. How are the destabilizing effects of functional mutations balanced to enable adaptation? Our analysis also indicated that many mutations that appear in directed evolution variants with no obvious role in the new function exert stabilizing effects that may compensate for the destabilizing effects of the crucial function-altering mutations. Thus, the evolution of new enzymatic activities, both in nature and in the laboratory, is dependent on the compensatory, stabilizing effect of apparently \\silent\\ mutations in regions of the protein that are irrelevant to its function.",

Carbon-specific light-saturated gross photosynthesis rates were not significantly different between cells acclimated to LL and HL. Acclimation to LL benefited cells by increasing biomass-specific light absorption and gross photosynthesis rates under low light, whereas acclimation to HL benefited cells by reducing the rate of photoinactivation of PSII under high light. Differences in the relative abundances of proteins assigned to light-harvesting (Lhcf), photoprotection (LI818-like), and the photosystem II (PSII) core complex accompanied differences in photophysiology: specifically, Lhcf:PSII was greater under LL, whereas LI818:PSII was greater in HL.

    "abstract_annotation": "The dictionary definition of stability as \\Firmly established, not easily to be changed\\ immediately indicates the conflict between stability and maneuverability in aquatic locomotion. The present paper addresses several issues resulting from these opposing requirements. Classical stability theory for bodies moving in fluids is based on developments in submarine and airship motions. These have lateral symmetry, in common with most animals. This enables the separation of the equations of motion into two sets of 3 each. The vertical (longitudinal) set, which includes motions in the axial (surge), normal (heave) and pitching directions, can thus be separated from the lateral-horizontal plane which includes yaw, roll and sideslip motions. This has been found useful in the past for longitudinal stability studies based on coasting configurations but is not applicable to the analysis of turning, fast starts and vigorous swimming, where the lateral symmetry of the fish body is broken by bending motions. The present paper will also examine some of the aspects of the stability vs. maneuverability tradeoff for these asymmetric motions. An analysis of the conditions under which the separation of equations of motions into vertical and horizontal planes is justified, and a definition of the equations to be used in cases where this separation is not accurate enough is presented.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Natural proteins often partake in several highly specific protein-protein interactions. They are thus subject to multiple opposing forces during evolutionary selection. To be functional, such multispecific proteins need to be stable in complex with each interaction partner, and, at the same time, to maintain affinity toward all partners. How is this multispecificity acquired through natural evolution? To answer this compelling question, we study a prototypical multispecific protein, calmodulin (CaM), which has evolved to interact with hundreds of target proteins. Starting from high-resolution structures of sixteen CaM-target complexes, we employ state-of-the-art computational methods to predict a hundred CaM sequences best suited for interaction with each individual CaM target. Then, we design CaM sequences most compatible with each possible combination of two, three, and all sixteen targets simultaneously, producing almost 70,000 low energy CaM sequences. By comparing these sequences and their energies, we gain insight into how nature has managed to find the compromise between the need for favorable interaction energies and the need for multispecificity. We observe that designing for more partners simultaneously yields CaM sequences that better match natural sequence profiles, thus emphasizing the importance of such strategies in nature. Furthermore, we show that the CaM binding interface can be nicely partitioned into positions that are critical for the affinity of all CaM-target complexes and those that are molded to provide interaction specificity. We reveal several basic categories of sequence-level tradeoffs that enable the compromise necessary for the promiscuity of this protein. We also thoroughly quantify the tradeoff between interaction energetics and multispecificity and find that facilitating seemingly competing interactions requires only a small deviation from optimal energies. We conclude that multispecific proteins have been subjected to a rigorous optimization process that has fine-tuned their sequences for interactions with a precise set of targets, thus conferring their multiple cellular functions.",

    "abstract_annotation": "In locomotion that involves repetitive motion of propulsive structures (arms, legs, fins, wings) there are resonant frequencies at which the energy consumption is a minimum. As animals need to change their speed, they can maintain this energy minimum by tuning their body resonances. We discuss the physical principles of frequency tuning, and how it relates to forces, damping, and oscillation amplitude. The resonant frequency of pendulum-type oscillators (e.g. swinging arms and legs) may be changed by varying the mass moment of inertia, or the vertical acceleration of the pendulum pivot. The frequency of elastic vibrations (e.g. the bell of a jellyfish) can be tuned with a non-linear modulus of elasticity: soft for low deflection amplitudes (low resonant frequency), and stiff for large displacements (high resonant frequency). Tuning of elastic oscillations can also be achieved by changing the effective length or cross-sectional area of the elastic members, or by allowing springs in parallel or in series to become active. We propose that swimming and flying animals generate oscillating propulsive forces from precisely placed shed vortices and that these tuned motions can only occur when vortex shedding and the simple harmonic motion of the elastic elements of the propulsive structures are in resonance.  \n",

However, trade-offs may play a crucial role in species evolution and should be found in host-parasitoid interactions where the host quality may differ between different sizes. Here, we investigated the effects of host size differences of Monochamus alternatus larva on foraging decisions, parasitism and related fitness in a gregarious ectoparasitoid, Sclerodermus harmandi. Two-choice and non-choice experiments were conducted with M. alternatus larvae to evaluate preference and performance of S. harmandi, respectively. Results from two-choice test showed that adult females prefer to attack large larvae rather than small larvae. In no-choice tests, adult females needed more time to paralyze large larvae than small larvae before laying eggs on the body surface of M. alternatus larvae and had lower survival and parasitism rate on those large larvae. Foraging decisions of S. harmandi led to the selection of the most profitable host size for parasitoid development, which showed more offspring gained on large M. alternatus larvae than on small larvae and got higher body weight on those large hosts. This study demonstrates the existence of trade-off occurring during host-parasitoids interactions according to host size related quality.",

    "abstract_annotation": "In the open ocean, many animals are highly transparent, some achieving near invisibility. However, little is known about how this transparency is attained. The effects of cellular ultrastructure on tissue transparency were mathematically modeled. Given a specific constant volume or surface area of a higher refractive index material (e.g. protein, lipid, etc.), Within a lower refractive index cytoplasm or other matrix, the model calculates the total amount of light scattered as a function of how the volume or surface area is subdivided. Given a constant volume, the scattering peaks strongly when the volume is divided into spheres of critical radii. The critical radii depend upon the refractive index of the material relative to its surroundings. Similarly, given a constant surface area, the scattering increases rapidly with sphere size until critical radii (approximating the critical radii for constant volume) are reached, after which the scattering is relatively constant. Under both constraints, refractive index is critical when the particles are small, but becomes progressively less important as particle size increases. When only forward scattering is considered, the results are essentially similar to those found for total scattering. When scattering at only larger angles is considered, the critical radii are independent of refractive index, and the scattered radiance depends critically on refractive index at all particle sizes. The effects of particle shape on scattering depend on the geometric constraint and particle size. Under constant volume constraints, small particles of any shape scatter light equally, but large spheres scatter less light than other larger shapes. Under constant surface area constraints, small spheres scatter more light than any small shape, but large particles of any shape scatter equally. This suggests that the attenuation of light in the highly and moderately transparent tissues sampled is mostly due to light scattering by medium-sized particles and that the attenuation in the nearly opaque tissues is mostly due to scattering by large particles.",

Interspecific comparisons suggest an inverse relationship between sperm velocity and sperm longevity but this trade-off has never been demonstrated within a species. Here I investigate how sperm velocity and sperm longevity influence the patterns of fertilization in the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. In the laboratory I examined 11 male female pairs of sea urchins for variation in sperm velocity and sperm longevity, and determined the correlations of these traits with the percentage of eggs fertilized with serially diluted sperm. Males with faster sperm had higher rates of fertilization than males with slower sperm. Within individual males, as sperm aged they slowed down and showed a reduced percentage activity and lower rates of fertilization. Across males, the average velocity of freshly spawned sperm was inversely related to sperm longevity. These results establish the possibility that sperm traits are adapted for varying conditions along a continuum from sperm limitation to sperm competition.",

In many species, individuals visit foraging patches in predictable sequences called traplines.

After introducing a single highly rewarding flower to the array, they re-adjusted their routes visiting the most rewarding flower first provided the departure distance from the shortest possible route remained small (18%). When routes optimizing the initial rate of reward intake were much longer (42%), bees prioritized short travel distances.4.Under natural conditions, in which individual flowers vary in nectar productivity and replenish continuously, it might pay bees to prioritize highly rewarding locations, both to minimize the overall number of flowers to visit and to beat competitors.5.We discuss how combined memories of location and quality of resource patches could allow bees and other traplining animals to optimize their routing decisions in heterogeneous environments.",

Humpback whales utilize extremely mobile, wing-like flippers for banking and turning. Large rounded tubercles along the leading edge of the flipper are morphological structures that are unique in nature. The tubercles on the leading edge act as passive-flow control devices that improve performance and maneuverability of the flipper. Experimental analysis of finite wing models has demonstrated that the presence of tubercles produces a delay in the angle of attack until stall, thereby increasing maximum lift and decreasing drag. Possible fluid-dynamic mechanisms for improved performance include delay of stall through generation of a vortex and modification of the boundary layer, and increase in effective span by reduction of both spanwise flow and strength of the tip vortex. The tubercles provide a bio-inspired design that has commercial viability for wing-like structures. Control of passive flow has the advantages of eliminating complex, costly, high-maintenance, and heavy control mechanisms, while improving performance for lifting bodies in air and water. The tubercles on the leading edge can be applied to the design of watercraft, aircraft, ventilation fans, and windmills.  \n",

Nevertheless, the motion of the freshwater snail, Sorbeoconcha physidae, is reminiscent of that of its terrestrial counterparts, being generated by the undulation of the snail foot that is separated from the free surface by a thin layer of mucus. Here, a lubrication model is used to describe the mucus flow in the limit of small amplitude interfacial deformations. By assuming the shape of the snail foot to be a traveling sine wave and the mucus to be Newtonian, an evolution equation for the interface shape is obtained and the resulting propulsive force on the snail is calculated. This propulsive force is found to be non-zero for moderate values of Capillary number but vanishes in the limits of high and low Capillary numbers. Physically, this force arises because the snail\u2019s foot deforms the free surface, thereby generating curvature pressures and lubrication flows inside the mucus layer that couple to the topography of the foot.",

In a Sonoran Desert winter annual plant community, we have identified a tradeoff between relative growth rate (RGR) and water-use efficiency (WUE) that predicts interannual variation in reproductive success. Here we test the hypothesis that traits underlying RGR and WUE differences are linked to seasonal phenology. We use long-term demographic data and finer-scale, short-term data to investigate timing of germination, reproduction, and death of several winter annual species in multiple years in open and under-shrub habitats. We hypothesized that species with high WUE and less interannual demographic variability would have life cycle transitions early in the winter to spring growing season. This would be due to an ability to use small amounts of rain and photosynthesize at low temperatures. By contrast, we hypothesized that species with low WUE whose survival and reproductive rates vary greatly from year to year would have life cycle transitions later in the season. In any given year, species with high WUE germinated and reproduced earlier in the season than species with low WUE, whereas low-WUE species germinated later and had shorter reproductive phases. Our results demonstrate a direct relationship between phenology and physiological trait differences. This link between phenology and physiology is of interest because it clarifies the mechanism by which trait differences determine species' relative abundances.",

Surprisingly, little empirical evidence exists on the co-variation of multiple plant defenses. We analyzed different genotypes of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) for the expression of two direct chemical defenses [cyanogenic potential (constitutive), polyphenolase (inducible)], two indirect chemical defenses [volatiles and extrafloral nectar (both inducible)] and a constitutive mechanical defense (hook-shaped trichomes). While the occurrence of trichomes was positively correlated with cyanogenesis, these traits showed a tradeoff with polyphenol oxidase activity, release of volatiles, and secretion of nectar. Hook-shaped trichomes were abundantly present in four of 14 genotypes investigated, and were found only in one monophyletic group of an AFLP-based tree, thus indicating a single evolutionary origin within the species. Our findings show that different lima bean genotypes express either one of two defense systems: 1) high constitutive defense via cyanogenesis and trichomes or 2) high inducible defense via volatiles, nectar, and polyphenolase activity.",

Spiders depend upon these properties for survival, yet the impressive performance of silk is not limited solely to tensile mechanics. Here, we show that silk also exhibits powerful cyclic contractions, allowing it to act as a high performance mimic of biological muscles. These contractions are actuated by changes in humidity alone and repeatedly generate work 50 times greater than the equivalent mass of human muscle. Although we demonstrate that this response is general and occurs weakly in diverse hydrophilic materials, the high modulus of spider silk is such that it generates exceptional force. Furthermore, because this effect already operates at the level of single silk fibers, only 5 {micro}m in diameter, it can easily be scaled across the entire size range at which biological muscles operate. By contrast, the most successful synthetic muscles developed so far are driven by electric voltage, such that they cannot scale easily across large ranges in cross-sectional areas. The potential applicability of silk muscles is further enhanced by our finding that silkworm fibers also exhibit cyclic contraction because they are already available in commercial quantities. The simplicity of using wet or dry air to drive the biomimetic silk muscle fibers and the incredible power generated by silk offer unique possibilities in designing lightweight and compact actuators for robots and micro-machines, new sensors, and green energy production.",

Therefore, a potential tradeoff between these pathways mediated by BAK1 is often postulated. Here, we show a unidirectional inhibition of FLS2-mediated immune signaling by BR perception. Unexpectedly, this effect occurred downstream or independently of complex formation with BAK1 and associated downstream phosphorylation. Thus, BAK1 is not rate-limiting in these pathways. BRs also inhibited signaling triggered by the BAK1-independent recognition of the fungal PAMP chitin.

    "abstract_annotation": "Ecological studies have rarely been performed at the community level across a large biogeographic region. Sponges are now the primary habitat-forming organisms on Caribbean coral reefs. Recent species-level investigations have demonstrated that predatory fishes (angelfishes and some parrotfishes) differentially graze sponges that lack chemical defenses, while co-occurring, palatable species heal, grow, reproduce, or recruit at faster rates than defended species. Our prediction, based on resource allocation theory, was that predator removal would result in a greater proportion of palatable species in the sponge community on overfished reefs. We tested this prediction by performing surveys of sponge and fish community composition on reefs having different levels of fishing intensity across the Caribbean. A total of 109 sponge species was recorded from 69 sites, with the 10 most common species comprising 51.0% of sponge cover (3.6\u20137.7% per species). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling indicated that the species composition of sponge communities depended more on the abundance of sponge-eating fishes than geographic location. Across all sites, multiple-regression analyses revealed that spongivore abundance explained 32.8% of the variation in the proportion of palatable sponges, but when data were limited to geographically adjacent locations with strongly contrasting levels of fishing pressure (Cayman Islands and Jamaica; Cura�ao, Bonaire, and Martinique), the adjusted R2 values were much higher (76.5% and 94.6%, respectively). Overfishing of Caribbean coral reefs, particularly by fish trapping, removes sponge predators and is likely to result in greater competition for space between fastergrowing palatable sponges and endangered reef-building corals.",

Thus far, artificial wet and dry adhesives have included hierarchical mushroom-shaped or porous structures that allow suction or capillarity, supramolecular structures comprising nanoparticles, and chemistry-based attractants that use various protein polyelectrolytes. However, it is challenging to develop adhesives that are simple to make and also perform well-and repeatedly-under both wet and dry conditions, while avoiding non-chemical contamination on the adhered surfaces. Here we present an artificial, biologically inspired, reversible wet/dry adhesion system that is based on the dome-like protuberances found in the suction cups of octopi. To mimic the architecture of these protuberances, we use a simple, solution-based, air-trap technique that involves fabricating a patterned structure as a polymeric master, and using it to produce a reversed architecture, without any sophisticated chemical syntheses or surface modifications. The micrometre-scale domes in our artificial adhesive enhance the suction stress. This octopus-inspired system exhibits strong, reversible, highly repeatable adhesion to silicon wafers, glass, and rough skin surfaces under various conditions (dry, moist, under water and under oil). To demonstrate a potential application, we also used our adhesive to transport a large silicon wafer in air and under water without any resulting surface contamination.",

Microbiologists should be aware that all of these traits are subject to constraints imposed by trade-offs, so adaptations improving one trait may be at the cost of another. A deeper appreciation of trade-offs is thus crucial for assessing the mechanistic limits on important bacterial characteristics. Studies of the negative correlations between various traits have revealed three molecular mechanisms, namely, trade-offs involving resource allocation, design constraint, and information processing. This review further discusses why these trade-off mechanisms are important in the establishment of models capable of predicting bacterial competition, coexistence, and sources of diversity.",

Army ants (Eciton) form collective assemblages out of their own bodies to perform a variety of functions that benefit the entire colony. Here we examine bridges\\ of linked individuals that are constructed to span gaps in the colony's foraging trail. How these living structures adjust themselves to varied and changing conditions remains poorly understood. Our field experiments show that the ants continuously modify their bridges, such that these structures lengthen, widen, and change position in response to traffic levels and environmental geometry. Ants initiate bridges where their path deviates from their incoming direction and move the bridges over time to create shortcuts over large gaps. The final position of the structure depended on the intensity of the traffic and the extent of path deviation and was influenced by a cost-benefit trade-off at the colony level, where the benefit of increased foraging trail efficiency was balanced by the cost of removing workers from the foraging pool to form the structure. To examine this trade-off, we quantified the geometric relationship between costs and benefits revealed by our experiments. We then constructed a model to determine the bridge location that maximized foraging rate, which qualitatively matched the observed movement of bridges. Our results highlight how animal self-assemblages can be dynamically modified in response to a group-level cost-benefit trade-off, without any individual unit's having information on global benefits or costs.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Covalent modification provides a mechanism for modulating molecular state and regulating physiology. A cycle of competing enzymes that add and remove a single modification can act as a molecular switch between \\on\\ and \\off\\ and has been widely studied as a core motif in systems biology. Here, we exploit the recently developed \\linear framework\\ for time scale separation to determine the general principles of such switches. These methods are not limited to Michaelis-Menten assumptions, and our conclusions hold for enzymes whose mechanisms may be arbitrarily complicated. We show that switching efficiency improves with increasing irreversibility of the enzymes and that the on/off transition occurs when the ratio of enzyme levels reaches a value that depends only on the rate constants. Fluctuations in enzyme levels, which habitually occur due to cellular heterogeneity, can cause flipping back and forth between on and off, leading to incoherent mosaic behavior in tissues, that worsens as switching becomes sharper. This trade-off can be circumvented if enzyme levels are correlated. In particular, if the competing catalytic domains are on the same protein but do not influence each other, the resulting bifunctional enzyme can switch sharply while remaining coherent. In the mammalian liver, the switch between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is regulated by the bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2). We suggest that bifunctionality of PFK-2/FBPase-2 complements the metabolic zonation of the liver by ensuring coherent switching in response to insulin and glucagon.",

We recently characterized the mechanics of the slime's fibrous component, and here we report the first mechanical properties of the mucin component and the slime as a whole. Our results suggest that hagfishes can produce remarkable quantities of the slime because it is almost three orders of magnitude more dilute than typical mucus secretions. Mechanical experiments using whole slime produced in vitro demonstrate that the slime threads dominate the slime's material properties and impart elasticity. Mucins impart viscosity at the strain rates tested and are important for rapid deployment of the slime. We also found that slime threads are tapered at both ends, which suggested to us that hagfish slime might best be modeled as a discontinuous fibre-reinforced composite. Our measurements demonstrate that the mucins are not capable of providing shear linkage between threads, but this is not necessary because the threads are long enough to span an entire slime mass. Our findings suggest that hagfish slime consists mainly of bulk seawater entrained between mucin-coated threads, and in this way functions more like a fine sieve than coherent mucus. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the slime has evolved as a defense against gill-breathing predators.  \n",

The wall of the corpus cavernosum contains layers of highly organized collagen fibers arranged at 0o and 90o to the penile long axis. Flaccid wall tissue is folded. Collagen fiber straightening during erection expands the tunica albuginea and increases both its stiffness and its second moment of area.

    "abstract_annotation": "Hummingbird flight muscle is estimated to have among the highest mass-specific power output among vertebrates, based on aerodynamic models. However, little is known about the fundamental contractile properties of their remarkable flight muscles. We hypothesized that hummingbird pectoralis fibers generate relatively low force when activated in a tradeoff for high shortening speeds associated with the characteristic high wingbeat frequencies that are required for sustained hovering. Our objective was to measure maximal force-generating ability (maximal force/cross-sectional area, Po/CSA) in single, skinned fibers from the pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles, which power the wing downstroke and upstroke, respectively, in hummingbirds (Calypte anna) and in another similarly sized species, zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), which also has a very high wingbeat frequency during flight but does not perform a sustained hover. Mean Po/CSA in hummingbird pectoralis fibers was very low - 1.6, 6.1 and 12.2 kN m(-2), at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C, respectively. Po/CSA in finch pectoralis fibers was also very low (for both species, ~5% of the reported Po/CSA of chicken pectoralis fast fibers at 15 degrees C). Q10-force (force generated at 20 degrees C/force generated at 10 degrees C) was very high for hummingbird and finch pectoralis fibers (mean=15.3 and 11.5, respectively) compared with rat slow and fast fibers (1.8 and 1.9, respectively). Po/CSA in hummingbird leg fibers was much higher than in pectoralis fibers at each temperature, and the mean Q10-force was much lower. Thus, hummingbird and finch pectoralis fibers have an extremely low force-generating ability compared with other bird and mammalian limb fibers, and an extremely high temperature dependence of force generation. However, the extrapolated maximum force-generating ability of hummingbird pectoralis fibers in vivo (~48 kN m(-2)) is substantially higher than the estimated requirements for hovering flight of C. anna. The unusually low Po/CSA of hummingbird and zebra finch pectoralis fibers may reflect a constraint imposed by a need for extremely high contraction frequencies, especially during hummingbird hovering.",

Here we provide, to our knowledge, the first rigorous experimental test of this hypothesis, and find dramatic changes in lifespan in the predicted direction in response to both upward and downward manipulations of growth rates. We used brief (less than 4% of median lifespan) exposure to relatively cold or warm temperatures early in life to deflect juvenile three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus from their normal growth trajectories; this induced catch-up or slowed-down growth when ambient temperatures were restored, and all groups attained the same average adult size. Catch-up growth led to a reduction in median lifespan of 14.5 per cent, while slowed-down growth extended lifespan by 30.6 per cent. These lifespan effects were independent of eventual size attained or reproductive investment in adult life. Photoperiod manipulations showed that the effects of compensatory growth on lifespan were also influenced by time available for growth prior to breeding, being more extreme when less time was available. These results demonstrate the growth-lifespan trade-off. While growing more slowly can increase longevity, the optimal resolution of the growth-lifespan trade-off is influenced by time constraints in a seasonal environment.",

The few taxa that inhabit this zone have presumably made specific adjustments to their neuromuscular function and have enhanced their metabolic capacity. However, support for this assertion is equivocal and the details of specific compensations are largely unknown. This can generally be attributed to the fact that most Antarctic organisms are either too distantly related to their temperate relatives to permit direct comparisons (e.g., notothenioid fishes) or because they are not amenable to neuromuscular recording. Here, as a comparative model, we take advantage of 2 pelagic molluscs in the genus Clione to conduct a broadly integrative investigation on neuromuscular adaptation to the extreme cold. We find that for the Antarctic congener aerobic capacity is enhanced, but at a cost. To support a striking proliferation of mitochondria, the Antarctic species has shed a 2-gear swim system and the associated specialized neuromuscular components, resulting in greatly reduced scope for locomotor activity.

Size regulation of body parts typically requires no external control and is thought to be relatively insensitive to signals from the developmental environment. We show in two very different systems, butterfly wings and beetle horns, that experimentally induced changes in the allocation of developmental resources to one trait produces compensatory changes in the relative sizes of other traits. These findings illustrate that interaction among body parts in development is part of the mechanism of size regulation of those parts. Furthermore, in the case of beetle horns, we show that the tradeoff in size is manifest as a significant negative genetic correlation among the involved body parts and, therefore, constitutes a developmental source of genetic constraint on the evolution of body form.",

    "abstract_annotation": "During the process of skill learning, synaptic connections in our brains are modified to form motor memories of learned sensorimotor acts. The more plastic the adult brain is, the easier it is to learn new skills or adapt to neurological injury. However, if the brain is too plastic and the pattern of synaptic connectivity is constantly changing, new memories will overwrite old memories, and learning becomes unstable. This trade-off is known as the stability-plasticity dilemma. Here a theory of sensorimotor learning and memory is developed whereby synaptic strengths are perpetually fluctuating without causing instability in motor memory recall, as long as the underlying neural networks are sufficiently noisy and massively redundant. The theory implies two distinct stages of learning--preasymptotic and postasymptotic--because once the error drops to a level comparable to that of the noise-induced error, further error reduction requires altered network dynamics. A key behavioral prediction derived from this analysis is tested in a visuomotor adaptation experiment, and the resultant learning curves are modeled with a nonstationary neural network. Next, the theory is used to model two-photon microscopy data that show, in animals, high rates of dendritic spine turnover, even in the absence of overt behavioral learning. Finally, the theory predicts enhanced task selectivity in the responses of individual motor cortical neurons as the level of task expertise increases. From these considerations, a unique interpretation of sensorimotor memory is proposed--memories are defined not by fixed patterns of synaptic weights but, rather, by nonstationary synaptic patterns that fluctuate coherently.",

Recent research has shown that the ratio of protein to carbohydrate (P : C) of a fly's diet mediates the lifespan-reproduction trade-off, with higher P : C diets increasing egg production but decreasing lifespan. To test whether this P : C effect is because of changing allocation strategies (Y-model hypothesis) or detrimental effects of protein ingestion on lifespan (lethal protein hypothesis), we measured lifespan and egg production in Queensland fruit flies varying in reproductive status (mated, virgin and sterilized females, virgin males) that were fed one of 18 diets varying in protein and carbohydrate amounts. The Y-model predicts that for sterilized females and for males, which require little protein for reproduction, there will be no effect of P : C ratio on lifespan; the lethal protein hypothesis predicts that the effect of P : C ratio should be similar in all groups. In support of the lethal protein hypothesis, and counter to the Y-model, the P : C ratio of the ingested diets had similar effects for all groups.

    "abstract_annotation": "The specific growth rate (SGR) of a cohort of 2000 tagged juvenile European sea bass was measured in a common tank, during two sequential cycles comprising three-weeks feed deprivation followed by three-weeks ad libitum re-feeding. After correction for initial size at age as fork length, there was a direct correlation between negative SGR (rate of mass loss) during feed deprivation and positive SGR (rate of compensatory growth) during re-feeding (Spearman rank correlation R=0.388, P=0.000002). Following a period of rearing under standard culture conditions, individuals representing 'high growth' phenotypes (GP) and 'high tolerance of feed deprivation' phenotypes (DP) were selected from either end of the SGR spectrum. Static and swimming respirometry could not demonstrate lower routine or standard metabolic rate in DP to account for greater tolerance of feed deprivation. Increased rates of compensatory growth in GP were not linked to greater maximum metabolic rate, aerobic metabolic scope or maximum cardiac performance than DP. When fed a standard ration, however, GP completed the specific dynamic action (SDA) response significantly faster than DP. Therefore, higher growth rate in GP was linked to greater capacity to process food. There was no difference in SDA coefficient, an indicator of energetic efficiency. The results indicate that individual variation in growth rate in sea bass reflects, in part, a trade-off against tolerance of food deprivation. The two phenotypes represented the opposing ends of a spectrum. The GP aims to exploit available resources and grow as rapidly as possible but at a cost of physiological and/or behavioural attributes, which lead to increased energy dissipation when food is not available. An opposing strategy, exemplified by DP, is less 'boom and bust', with a lower physiological capacity to exploit resources but which is less costly to sustain during periods of food deprivation.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Opaque screening pigments are a fundamental requisite for preserving resolution in image-forming eyes. Possession of any type of image-forming eye in a transparent, pelagic animal will thus undermine the ability of that animal to be invisible in the water column. Transparent, pelagic animals must therefore deal with the trade-off between the ability to see and the ability of other animals to see them. Stomatopod larvae, like many transparent crustaceans, possess specialized optics in their compound eyes that minimize the volume of the opaque retina. Though the volumes of these retinas are reduced, their opacity remains conspicuous to an observer. The light reflected from structures overlying the retinas of stomatopod crustacean larval eyes, referred to here as eyeshine, is hypothesized to further reduce the visibility of opaque retinas. Blue or green wavelengths of light are most strongly reflected in stomatopod larval eyeshine, suggesting a putative spectral matching to the light environment against which the larval eyes are viewed. We tested the efficacy of stomatopod crustacean larval eyeshine as an ocular camouflaging mechanism by photographing larvae in their natural light environment and analysing the contrast of eyes with the background light. To test for spectral matching between stomatopod larval eyeshine and the background light environment, we characterized the spectrum of eyeshine and calculated its performance using radiometric measurements collected at the time of each photographic series. These results are the first to demonstrate an operative mirror camouflage matched in both spectrum and radiance to the pelagic background light environment.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Many natural and artificial decision-making systems face decision problems where there is an inherent compromise between two or more objectives. One such common compromise is between the speed and accuracy of a decision. The ability to exploit the characteristics of a decision problem in order to vary between the extremes of making maximally rapid, or maximally accurate decisions, is a useful property of such systems. Colonies of the ant Temnothorax albipennis (formerly Leptothorax albipennis) are a paradigmatic decentralized decision-making system, and have been shown flexibly to compromise accuracy for speed when making decisions during house-hunting. During emigration, a colony must typically evaluate and choose between several possible alternative new nest sites of differing quality. In this paper, we examine this speed-accuracy trade-off through modelling, and conclude that noise and time-cost of assessing alternative choices are likely to be significant for T. albipennis. Noise and cost of such assessments are likely to mean that T. albipennis' decision-making mechanism is Pareto-optimal in one crucial regard; increasing the willingness of individuals to change their decisions cannot improve collective accuracy overall without impairing speed. We propose that a decentralized control algorithm based on this emigration behaviour may be derived for applications in engineering domains and specify the characteristics of the problems to which it should be suited, based on our new results.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Cells sense chemical spatial gradients and respond by polarizing internal components. This process can be disrupted by gradient noise caused by fluctuations in chemical concentration. RESULTS: We investigated how external gradient noise affects spatial sensing and response focusing on noise-filtering and the resultant tradeoffs. First, using a coarse-grained mathematical model of gradient-sensing and cell polarity, we characterized three negative consequences of noise: Inhibition of the extent of polarization, degradation of directional accuracy, and production of a noisy output polarization. Next, we explored filtering strategies and discovered that a combination of positive feedback, multiple signaling stages, and time-averaging produced good results. There was an important tradeoff, however, because filtering resulted in slower polarization. Simulations demonstrated that a two-stage filter-amplifier resulted in a balanced outcome. Then, we analyzed the effect of noise on a mechanistic model of yeast cell polarization in response to gradients of mating pheromone. This analysis showed that yeast cells likely also combine the above three filtering mechanisms into a filter-amplifier structure to achieve impressive spatial-noise tolerance, but with the consequence of a slow response time. Further investigation of the amplifier architecture revealed two positive feedback loops, a fast inner and a slow outer, both of which contributed to noise-tolerant polarization. This model also made specific predictions about how orientation performance depended upon the ratio between the gradient slope (signal) and the noise variance. To test these predictions, we performed microfluidics experiments measuring the ability of yeast cells to orient to shallow gradients of mating pheromone. The results of these experiments agreed well with the modeling predictions, demonstrating that yeast cells can sense gradients shallower than 0.1% mum-1, approximately a single receptor-ligand molecule difference between front and back, on par with motile eukaryotic cells.: Spatial noise impedes the extent, accuracy, and smoothness of cell polarization. A combined filtering strategy implemented by a filter-amplifier architecture with slow dynamics was effective. Modeling and experimental data suggest that yeast cells employ these elaborate mechanisms to filter gradient noise resulting in a slow but relatively accurate polarization response.",

Using the toadfish swimbladder muscle, the fastest known vertebrate muscle, we examined the crossbridge kinetic rates responsible for high contraction rates and how these might affect force generation. Swimbladder fibers have evolved a 10-fold faster crossbridge detachment rate than fast-twitch locomotory fibers, but surprisingly the crossbridge attachment rate has remained unchanged. These kinetics result in very few crossbridges being attached during contraction of superfast fibers (only 1/6 of that in locomotory fibers) and thus low force. This imbalance between attachment and detachment rates is likely to be a general mechanism that imposes a tradeoff of force for speed in all superfast fibers.",

In natural populations of Petrobius brevistylis at least 67% of animals had broken antennae. In twenty-four trials, all antennae broke at a breakpoint under the animal\u2019s weight. Breakpoints consist of two cylinders of laminated cuticle, one stuck inside the other. For half the length of the breakpoint the cylinders are separated by a non-laminated layer of cuticle; thus a tripartite cuticle is formed. During a breakage, the two cylinders slide apart along that non-laminated middle layer that seems to act like a lubricant. While the cylinders pull apart, a thin cuticle unfolds that closes off the new tip of the antenna formed by the outer breakpoint cylinder. Later on, the cylinder is not replaced by a new terminal antennomere. Instead, the antennomere directly proximal to a breakpoint, i.e. the one that after the break forms the last antennomere, already possess the same complement of sensilla as the original terminal antennomere. This includes sensilla basiconica Type A and B found exclusively on these antennomeres and the original terminal antennomere.

    "abstract_annotation": "In a resonant vibration, two reactive elements, such as a mass and a spring, interact: the resonant frequency depends on the magnitude of these two elements. The build-up and decay of the vibration depend on the way the resonator is driven and on the damping in the system.  Mechanical frequency-multiplier mechanisms, which convert the relatively slow contraction of muscles to the higher frequency of the sound, are commonly used to convert the comparatively slow muscle contraction rate to the higher frequency of the sound. The phasing and rate of mechanical excitation may also affect the frequency and duration of the sound that is produced. Although in many insects the song may appear to be produced by the excitation of a simple resonator, the song frequency may not be constant, suggesting that other factors, such as the mechanism of excitation, or variation of the effective mass or elasticity of the system during sound production, may be additional determinants of the song frequency. Loud, and hence efficient, transduction of the energy of a mechanical resonator into sound may involve a second stage of transduction which, by damping the resonator, may compromise tonal purity. Some insect singers resolve this problem by tuning both stages of transduction to the same frequency, thereby maintaining tonal purity.  \n",

    "abstract_annotation": "Females often select their mates on the basis of the size or intensity of sexual ornaments, and it is thought that such traits are reliable indicators of male quality because the costliness of these traits prevents cheating. The immuno-competence handicap hypothesis is a recently proposed mechanistic explanation of these costs and states that males carry ornaments at the expense of their resistance to disease and parasites. The tradeoff between immunocompetence and sexual ornamentation was hypothesized to arise as a consequence of the dual effect of androgens on ornamentation and immune functiono. T test this hypothesis, we compared comb size between male domestic chickens Gallus domesticus of lines divergently selected for antibody responses to sheep erythrocytes (three lines: selected for low response or high response and a control line). The importance of comb size in inter- and intrasexual selection is well established, and comb size is strongly dependent on testosterone level. Comb size was larger in the males of the low line than in the high line, and comb size of control males was intermediate, indicating a tradeoff between ornamentation and immunocompetence. Testosterone (T) levels varied in a similar fashion (TLow > TControl > THigh), suggesting that this hormone could mediate the tradeoff between ornamentation and immunocompetence. These results support the idea that a tradeoff with immune function may constrain the expression of secondary sexual ornaments.",

    "abstract_annotation": "For most insects, size determines the call frequency. This paper describes the acoustics of a small brachypterous cricket (Rufocephalus sp.; body length 9.6 mm) producing a call with a carrier frequency of approximately 3.2 khz from a subterranean burrow. Crickets such as Gryllus campestris are approximately twice this length and produce a call frequency close to 5 khz. The burrow of Rufocephalus opens via a small hole with a diameter of 3.2 mm. The neck of the hole at approximately 1.4 mm depth opens to a vertical two-part burrow with an upper vase-shaped chamber 16.1 mm in height with a diameter of 9.4 mm. This top chamber connects via a 6.4 mm high (diameter 5.2 mm) neck to a more irregular chamber approximately 18 mm high with a width of approximately 11 mm. The walls of the top chamber neck and of the upper part of the lower chamber are smooth and appear to be sealed with saliva. The song has a mean centre frequency of 3.2 khz and is made up of variable-length trills of pulses of mean duration 15.8 ms. Many song pulses had smooth envelopes and their frequency did not vary by more than �40hz from the centre frequency, With a relative bandwidth Q-3db of over 50, other pulses showed considerable amplitude and frequency modulation within the pulse. When driven by external sound, burrows resonated at a mean frequency of 3.5 khz with a mean quality factor Q of 7.4. Natural-size model burrows resonated at similar frequencies with similar Q values. One cricket, which had previously called from its own burrow at 2.95 khz, sang at 3.27 khz from a burrow that resonated at the same frequency. Life-size model burrows driven by external sound resonated at similar frequencies to the actual burrows; models three times life size resonated at one-third of this frequency. In all models, the sound pressure was more or less constant throughout the top chamber but fell rapidly in the neck of the burrow; the phase of the sound was effectively constant in the top chamber and neck and fell through approximately 180� in passing from the neck into the lower chamber. A numerical model of the sound flow from region to region gave essentially similar results. A resonant electrical model fed from a high-impedance source with discrete tone bursts at different frequencies showed similar amplitude and frequency modulation to the various types of song pulses that were observed. It is suggested that the high purity of the songs results from close entrainment of the sound-producing mechanism of the insect\u2019s wings to the sharply resonant burrow.",

We used multibeam sonar to observe three-dimensional structure of Antarctic krill shoals acoustically. Shoal size and packing density varied greatly, but surface area:volume ratios (roughnesses) were distributed narrowly about w3.3 m21. Shoals of clupeid fish (e.g., sardine, anchovy) from geographically and oceanographically diverse locations have very similar roughnesses. This common emergent shape property suggests common driving forces across diverse ecosystems. Group behavior can be complex, but a simple tradeoff that we model\u2014in which individual fish and krill juggle only their access to oxygen-replete water and exposure to predation can explain the observed shoal shape.

However, carotenoids also seem to play an important role in immune defence as free radical scavengers. To test whether predation risk influences carotenoid levels and whether changes in carotenoid levels are related to changes in immune defence, I examined individual changes in large carotenoid and other lipid droplets upon exposure to predation risk and subsequent exposure to parasites in the copepod Macrocyclops albidus. Copepods reduced carotenoid reserves upon exposure to predators, through which they potentially avoided the costs of being conspicuous under predation risk. Thus, the size of carotenoid reserves is a plastic trait. Such a decrease in carotenoid reserves may also have a negative impact on the copepods' immune system as individuals that decreased their reserves suffered higher parasite prevalence upon exposure to the cestode Schistocephalus solidus. These results suggest that carotenoid reserves may be individually optimized to trade-off each individual's unique costs (predation risk) and benefits (immune defence) of having these reserves.",

We examined the landscape-level distribution of groups of blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, and Burchell's zebra, Equus burchelli, in a predominantly woodland area (Karongwe Game Reserve, South Africa; KGR) to test the hypothesis that group dynamics are a function of minimizing predation risk from their primary predator, lion, Panthera leo. Using generalized linear models, we examined the relative importance of habitat type (differing in vegetation density), probability of encountering lion (based on utilization distribution of all individual lions in the reserve), and season in predicting group size and composition. We found that only in open scrub habitat, group size for both ungulate species increased with the probability of encountering lion. Group composition differed between the two species and was driven by habitat selection as well as predation risk. For both species, composition of groups was, however, dominated by males in open scrub habitats, irrespective of the probability of encountering lion. Distribution patterns of wildebeest and zebra groups at the landscape level directly support the theoretical and empirical evidence from a range of taxa predicting that grouping is favored in open habitats and when predation risk is high. Group composition reflected species-specific social, physiological and foraging constraints, as well as the importance of predation risk. Avoidance of high resource open scrub habitat by females can lead to loss of foraging opportunities, which can be particularly costly in areas such as KGR, where this resource is limited. Thus, landscape-level grouping dynamics are species specific and particular to the composition of the group, arising from a tradeoff between maximizing resource selection and minimizing predation risk.",

Such a trade-off would be consistent with the observed trade-off between maximum speed and endurance in athletes and some animals that has been explained by cost-benefit theory. This trend would have importance for the general understanding of leaf design, and would simplify models of annual leaf carbon relations. We tested for such a trade-off using a database analysis across vascular plants and using an experimental approach for 29 cycad species, representing an ancient plant lineage with diversified evergreen leaves. In both tests, a higher photosynthetic rate per mass or per area in the favorable season was associated with a stronger absolute or percent decline in the unfavorable season. We resolved a possible mechanism based on biomechanics and nitrogen allocation; cycads with high leaf toughness (leaf mass per area) and higher investment in leaf construction than in physiological function (C/N ratio) tended to have lower warm season photosynthesis but less depression in the cool season. We propose that this trade-off, consistent with cost-benefit theory, represents a significant physio-phenological constraint on the diversity and seasonal dynamics of photosynthetic rate.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Bumblebee foragers spend a significant portion of their lives transporting nectar and pollen, often carrying loads equivalent to more than half their body mass. Whereas nectar is stored in the abdomen near the bee's center of mass, pollen is carried on the hind legs, farther from the center of mass. We examine how load position changes the rotational moment of inertia in bumblebees and whether this affects their flight maneuverability and/or stability. We applied simulated pollen or nectar loads of equal mass to Bombus impatiens bumblebees and examined flight performance in a wind tunnel under three conditions: flight in unsteady flow, tracking an oscillating flower in smooth flow, and flower tracking in unsteady flow. Using an inertial model, we estimated that carrying a load on the legs rather than in the abdomen increases a bee's moment of inertia about the roll and yaw axes but not the pitch axis. Consistent with these predictions, we found that bees carrying a load on their legs displayed slower rotations about their roll and yaw axes, regardless of whether these rotations were driven by external perturbations or self-initiated steering maneuvers. This allowed pollen-loaded bees to maintain a more stable body orientation and higher median flight speed in unsteady flow but reduced their performance when tracking a moving flower, supporting the concept of a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability. These results demonstrate that the types of resources collected by bees affect their flight performance and energetics and suggest that wind conditions may influence resource selection.",

    "abstract_annotation": "The ubiquitous trade-off between survival and costly reproduction is one of the most fundamental constraints governing life-history evolution. In numerous animals, gonadotropic hormones antagonistically suppressing immunocompetence cause this trade-off. The queens of many social insects defy the reproduction-survival trade-off, achieving both an extraordinarily long life and high reproductive output, but how they achieve this is unknown. Here we show experimentally, by integrating quantification of gene expression, physiology and behaviour, that the long-lived queens of the ant Lasius niger have escaped the reproduction-immunocompetence trade-off by decoupling the effects of a key endocrine regulator of fertility and immunocompetence in solitary insects, juvenile hormone (JH). This modification of the regulatory architecture enables queens to sustain a high reproductive output without elevated JH titres and suppressed immunocompetence, providing an escape from the reproduction-immunocompetence trade-off that may contribute to the extraordinary lifespan of many social insect queens.",

    "abstract_annotation": "We explored how functional diversity among predators of the freshwater snail Physa creates an adaptive trade-off for the snail\u2019s shell morphology. Physid shells range continuously between elongate and rotund in overall shape. The protection conferred by alternative shell shapes depends on the mode of attack employed by predators. Predators attack Physa primarily through shell entry (by crayfish, Orconectes obscurus) and shell crushing (by fish, Lepomis gibbosus, Cyprinus carpio, Carrasius auratus). The narrow apertures associated with elongate shells were expected to restrict apertural access by crayfish, as it does in several marine gastropod\u2013decapod interactions. The orbicular body whorls of rotund shells were predicted to disperse better the crushing forces applied by fish. Resistance to one predator then implies susceptibility to the other because shells can be relatively rotund or elongate but not both. Three levels of evidence from this study supported the idea of a trade-off: (1) measurement with laboratory instruments indicated that rotund shells were relatively crush-resistant, whereas elongate shells were more entry-resistant; (2) foraging trials showed that rotund shells required more handling time and were rejected more frequently by fish, whereas snails with elongate shells were more likely to survive with crayfish; and (3) field samples revealed rotund shell morphology in habitats where fish were common. The physical tests, foraging trials and field survey of the present study demonstrate the functional basis for predator-induced plasticity, which has been documented elsewhere for physid shell morphology and serves as a fourth line of support for the existence of an adaptive trade-off. Implications of the trade-off for the behaviour of predators and prey are also discussed.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Honey bees, Apis mellifera, face many parasites and pathogens and consequently rely on a diverse set of individual and group-level defenses to prevent disease. One route by which honey bees and other insects might combat disease is through the shielding effects of their microbial symbionts. Bees carry a diverse assemblage of bacteria, very few of which appear to be pathogenic. Here we explore the inhibitory effects of these resident bacteria against the primary bacterial pathogen of honey bees, Paenibacillus larvae. Here we isolate, culture, and describe by 16S rRNA and protein-coding gene sequences 61 bacterial isolates from honey bee larvae, reflecting a total of 43 distinct bacterial taxa. We culture these bacteria alongside the primary larval pathogen of honey bees, Paenibacillus larvae, and show that many of these isolates severely inhibit the growth of this pathogen. Accordingly, symbiotic bacteria including those described here are plausible natural antagonists toward this widespread pathogen. The results suggest a tradeoff in social insect colonies between the maintenance of potentially beneficial bacterial symbionts and deterrence at the individual and colony level of pathogenic species. They also provide a novel mechanism for recently described social components behind disease resistance in insect colonies, and point toward a potential control strategy for an important bee disease.",

We now report that mean, median, and maximum life spans are increased by 40-50% for Snell dwarf (Pit1(dw)/Pit1(dw)) DW/J females, and 25-50% for dwarf DWC3F1 males and females with the compound heterozygous Pit1(dw)/Pit1(dw-J) genotype. We previously observed aspects of delayed senescence in Snell dwarf (Pit1(dw)/Pit1(dw)) DW/J males; however, their median life span was shortened by about 25% (Genetic Effects on Aging II, 1990, The Telford Press, Caldwell, NJ, pp. 435-456). This short life span was not an intrinsic effect of the mutation, but a consequence of housing male dwarfs with normal-sized male littermates; our present results demonstrate that Snell dwarf males attain very long life spans when housed with normal-sized females. We conclude that the dwarf mutation interacts with environmental factors to alter life spans and, probably, rates of ageing, over an extremely broad range. We propose that this variation in the effect of the Snell dwarf mutation results from a tradeoff between physical vigor and life span that is mediated by pituitary hormones, and that growth hormone, thyroid hormone, and possibly prolactin regulate mechanisms that schedule mortality in mammals.",

Why are great apes, the largest primates, not also those endowed with the largest brains? Recently, we showed that the energetic cost of the brain is a linear function of its numbers of neurons. Here we show that metabolic limitations that result from the number of hours available for feeding and the low caloric yield of raw foods impose a tradeoff between body size and number of brain neurons, which explains the small brain size of great apes compared with their large body size. This limitation was probably overcome in Homo erectus with the shift to a cooked diet. Absent the requirement to spend most available hours of the day feeding, the combination of newly freed time and a large number of brain neurons affordable on a cooked diet may thus have been a major positive driving force to the rapid increased in brain size in human evolution.",

    "abstract_annotation": "On Caribbean coral reefs, some sponge species produce chemical defenses, while others do not and are non-fatally grazed by predatory fishes. It has been hypothesized that the latter may compensate for fish grazing by growing faster or rapidly healing wounds. Rates of wound-healing were measured for chemically defended and undefended tubular and vase-shaped sponges on patch reefs in the Florida Keys and Bahamas in 2002. Healing rates were significantly faster during the first few days of the experiment, with rates leveling off after the third day. Chemically undefended sponges healed at significantly faster rates (Callyspongia plicifera, 8% area regenerated per day; Callyspongia vaginalis, 6%; Niphates digitalis, 6%; Xestospongia muta, 6.5%) than chemically defended sponges (Cribrochalina vasculum, 2%; Ircinia campana, 2%; Verongula gigantea, 0%). Orientation of wounds relative to the tidal current had no influence on healing rates. Specimens of Niphates digitalis growing in tubular form had faster healing rates than individuals with vasiform shapes. Our results suggest that Caribbean reef sponges followed two different evolutionary trajectories: chemically defended species deter fish predation and have slow healing rates, while chemically undefended species allocate resources to rapid wound-healing in response to grazing.",

    "abstract_annotation": "When simple shoots and flowers are examined, a restricted set of patterns is found. Characterization involves three levels of scale: \n(1) the overall array is roughly radially symmetrical. \n(2) the elements within it are usually arranged in either straight radii or in spiral lines. \n(3) the element itself, e.g., A leaf or petal, has a plane of bilateral symmetry that lies on a radius of the overall array.  \nThe buckling of a constrained sheet can propagate pattern. Formation of bumps on a sheet under uniform upward pressure is influenced both by the edge constraints and by humps already present on it. I propose that in meristems the tunica exhibits minimal energy buckling, and the corpus supplies upward pressure. Simulations involving bumps can propagate patterns with straight or spiral configurations. This is feed-forward of pattern, at the second level. When bumps also develop adaxial creases tangential to the margin of the dome, these creases link the bilateral symmetry of the appendage with the overall radial symmetry (levels 1 and 3). By serving as an apparent new linear anchor for buckling of the dome, a new crease converts the influence of a leaf on the dome from modifying internal curvature to becoming an external boundary condition. Creases appear stiff and tend to form a ring. When such a ring is kept taut by internal pressure, it promotes radial symmetry, stabilizing the whole array. The mechanical model ties together all three levels of scale. Cyclic buckling could explain why the number of patterns is restricted and why they take the form that they do^^rdfs:Literal",

Here, we examine the complex trade-off between flexibility and inertial loading using a simple computational model of the bull kelp Nereocystis luetkeana. In field and laboratory tests, the model accurately predicts the forces and motions imposed on flexible structures in wave-induced flows. Subsequent predictions from the model suggest that mature N. luetkeana can indeed benefit from moving with the flow, but that the forces imposed on juveniles are actually increased by the plant\u2019s flexibility. Furthermore, the benefit accrued from going with the flow is sensitive to the shape of the plant. If the bull kelp were to grow while maintaining a juvenile shape, the stress placed on its stipe would be drastically increased by dynamic loading, and these inappropriately shaped plants would be subjected to a high risk of breakage. For certain combinations of wave height, wave period and stipe length, the increased stress in hypothetical \u2018small\u2019-shaped plants may be associated with chaotic motion of the blade mass.  \n",

Typical animal responses to predator exposure include reduced feeding, elevated metabolism, and altered development rate, all of which can be beneficial in the presence of predators but detrimental in their absence. How then do animals balance growth and predator avoidance? In a series of field and greenhouse experiments, we document that the tobacco hornworm caterpillar, Manduca sexta, reduced feeding by 30-40% owing to the risk of predation by stink bugs, but developed more rapidly and gained the same mass as unthreatened caterpillars. Assimilation efficiency, extraction of nitrogen from food, and percent body lipid content all increased during the initial phase (1-3 d) of predation risk, indicating that enhanced nutritional physiology allows caterpillars to compensate when threatened. However, we report physiological costs of predation risk, including altered body composition (decreased glycogen) and reductions in assimilation efficiency later in development. Our findings indicate that hornworm caterpillars use temporally dynamic compensatory mechanisms that ameliorate the trade-off between predator avoidance and growth in the short term, deferring costs to a period when they are less vulnerable to predation.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Some species of Ovalipes display spectacular iridescence resulting from multilayer reflectors in the cuticle. This reflector is unique in animals because each layer is corrugated and slightly out of phase with adjacent layers. Solid layers are separated from fluid layers in the reflector by side branches acting as support struts. A consequence is that blue light is reflected over a 'broad' angle around a plane parallel to the sea floor when the host crab is resting.  All species of Ovalipes possess stridulatory structures. The shallow-water species with the best developed stridulatory structures are non-iridescent and use sound as a signal. Deep-water species possess poorly developed stridulatory structures and display iridescence from most regions of the body in deep water, where incident light is blue. A light display is highly directional in contrast to sound produced via stridulation. Sound and light display probably perform the same function of sexual signalling in Ovalipes, although the directional signal is less likely to attract predators. Deep-water species of Ovalipes appear to have evolved towards using light in conspecific signalling. This change from using sound to using light reflects the change in habitat light properties, perhaps the hunting mechanisms of cohabitees, and its progression is an indicator of phylogeny. The changes in sexual signalling mechanisms, following spatial- geographical isolation, may have promoted speciation in Ovalipes.  \n",

    "abstract_annotation": "A substantial increase in grain yield potential is required, along with better use of water and fertilizer, to ensure food security and environmental protection in future decades. For improvements in photosynthetic capacity to result in additional wheat yield, extra assimilates must be partitioned to developing spikes and grains and/or potential grain weight increased to accommodate the extra assimilates. At the same time, improvement in dry matter partitioning to spikes should ensure that it does not increase stem or root lodging. It is therefore crucial that improvements in structural and reproductive aspects of growth accompany increases in photosynthesis to enhance the net agronomic benefits of genetic modifications. In this article, six complementary approaches are proposed, namely: (i) optimizing developmental pattern to maximize spike fertility and grain number, (ii) optimizing spike growth to maximize grain number and dry matter harvest index, (iii) improving spike fertility through desensitizing floret abortion to environmental cues, (iv) improving potential grain size and grain filling, and (v) improving lodging resistance. Since many of the traits tackled in these approaches interact strongly, an integrative modelling approach is also proposed, to (vi) identify any trade-offs between key traits, hence to define target ideotypes in quantitative terms. The potential for genetic dissection of key traits via quantitative trait loci analysis is discussed for the efficient deployment of existing variation in breeding programmes. These proposals should maximize returns in food production from investments in increased crop biomass by increasing spike fertility, grain number per unit area and harvest index whilst optimizing the trade-offs with potential grain weight and lodging resistance.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Predation is one of the main causes of adult mortality and breeding failure for ground-nesting birds. Micro-habitat structure around nests plays a critical role in minimizing predation risk. Plovers nest in sites with little vegetation cover to maximize the incubating adult visibility, but many studies suggest a trade-off between nest-crypsis and predator detection strategies. However, this trade-off has not been explored in detail because methods used so far do not allow estimating the visibility with regards to critical factors such as slope or plant permeability to vision. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Kentish plovers select exposed sites according to a predator detection strategy, and the hypothesis that more concealed nests survive longer according to a crypsis strategy. To this end, we obtained an accurate estimation of the incubating adult's field of vision through a custom built inverted periscope. Our results showed that plovers selected nest sites with higher visibility than control points randomly selected with regards to humans and dogs, although nests located in sites with higher vegetation cover survived longer. In addition, the flushing distance (i.e., the distance at which incubating adults leave the nest when they detect a potential predator) decreased with vegetation cover. Consequently, the advantages of concealing the nest were limited by the ability to detect predators, thus indirectly supporting the existence of the trade-off between crypsis and predator detection. Finally, human disturbance also constrained nest choice, forcing plovers to move to inland sites that were less suitable because of higher vegetation cover, and modulated flushing behavior, since plovers that were habituated to humans left their nests closer to potential predators. This constraint on the width of suitable breeding habitat is particularly relevant for the conservation of Kentish Plover in sand beaches, especially under the current context of coastal regression and increase of recreational activities.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Once mated, the optimal strategy for females of the monandrous butterfly, Pararge aegeria, is to avoid male contact and devote as much time as possible to ovipositing, as there is little advantage for females to engage in multiple matings. In other butterfly species the presence of males during egg laying has been shown to affect aspects of oviposition behavior and it has been suggested that repeated interference from males has the potential to reduce reproductive output. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of male presence during oviposition on reproductive output and behavior of a population of P. aegeria obtained from Madeira Island, Portugal, and maintained in the laboratory. Two experiments were performed where females were housed individually in small cages. Experiment 1 examined how social factors influenced the egg laying behavior of females. To do this the presence or absence of males was manipulated and egg size and number was measured over the first 14 days of oviposition. It was observed that when males were present during oviposition females made a trade-off between egg size and number. Experiment 2 examined how social factors affected oviposition site choice. Again, male presence/absence was manipulated, but in this experiment where the female laid her egg in relation to host quality was scored, and the size of the egg laid was measured. In the absence of males females selectively positioned their larger eggs on good quality host plants. However, selective oviposition was no longer observed when females were in the presence of males. We suggest that P. aegeria females from the Madeira Island population are adapted for a flexible oviposition strategy, governed by external cues, allowing a trade-off between egg size and number when the time available for egg laying is limiting.",

CompariA protein sequence serves two purpson with the folding of wild-type beta-trefoil proteins shows that function affects folding in two ways: In the slower folding interleukin-1beta, binding sites make the fold more complex, increase contact order and slow folding. In the faster folding hisactophilin, residues which could have been part of the folding-motif are used for function. This reduces the density of native contacts in functional regions and increases folding rate. The folding-motif helps identify subtle structural deviations which perturb folding. These may then be used for functional annotation. Further, the folding-motif could potentially be used as a first step in the sequence design of function-less scaffold proteins.

    "abstract_annotation": "Mexican blind cavefish exhibit an unconditioned wall-following behavior in response to novel environments.  Mexican blind cave fish (Astyanax sp.) and sighted Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus) were videotaped after fish were introduced into a novel environment under dark (infrared) or well-lit conditions. Under dark conditions, both sighted and blind morphs exhibited wall-following behavior with subtle but significant differences. Blind morphs swam more nearly parallel to the wall, exhibited greater wall-following continuity and reached higher levels of sustained swimming speeds more quickly than sighted morphs. In contrast, sighted morphs in the light remained motionless near the wall for long periods of time or moved slowly around the center of the tank without entraining to the walls. These results are consistent with the idea that wall-following is a shared, primitive trait that serves an exploratory function under dark conditions to compensate for the absence of vision. This behavior has become more honed in blind morphs for exploratory purposes\u2014in large part due to the enhanced, active-flow sensing abilities of the lateral line.^^rdfs:Literal",

Currently, little is known about the possibility of the dual purpose of an animal colour pattern in the UV region of the spectrum, which is potentially perceivable by both predators and conspecifics for detection or communication purposes. Here, we implemented linearised digital UV photography to characterise and quantify the colour pattern of an endemic Australian Agamid lizard classically regarded as monomorphic when considering data from the visible region of the spectrum. Our results indicate a widespread presence of UV elements across the entire body of the lizards and these patterns vary significantly in intensity, size and frequency between sexes. These results were modelled considering either lizard or avian visual characteristics, revealing that UV reflectance represents a trade-off between the requirements of sexual displaying to conspecifics and concealment from avian predators.",

Few studies involving terrestrial arthropod larvae have investigated prey capture behavior and kinematics and no study has shown modulation of strike kinematics. We examined feeding kinematics of the ant-lion, Myrmeleon crudelis, using high-speed video to investigate whether larvae modulate strike behavior based on prey location relative to the mandible. Based on seven capture events from five M. crudelis, the strike took 17.60�2.92 msec and was characterized by near-simultaneous contact of both mandibles with the prey. Modulation of the angular velocity of the mandibles based on prey location was clearly demonstrated. M. crudelis larvae attempted to simultaneously contact picey with both mandibles by increasing mean angular velocity of the far mandible (6S�21 rad sec-1) compared with the near mandible (3S�14 rad sec-1). Furthermore, kinematic results showed a significant difference for mean angular velocity between the two mandibles. Given the lengthy strike duration compared with other fast-striking arthropods, these data suggest that there is a tradeoff between the ability to modulate strike behavior for accurate simultaneous mandible contact and the overall velocity of the strike.^^rdfs:Literal",

    "abstract_annotation": "BACKGROUND: The invasive Chondrostoma nasus nasus has colonized part of the distribution area of the protected endemic species Chondrostoma toxostoma toxostoma. This hybrid zone is a complex system where multiple effects such as inter-species competition, bi-directional introgression, strong environmental pressure and so on are combined. Why do sympatric Chondrostoma fish present a unidirectional change in body shape? Is this the result of inter-species interactions and/or a response to environmental effects or the result of trade-offs? Studies focusing on the understanding of a trade-off between multiple parameters are still rare. Although this has previously been done for Cichlid species flock and for Darwin finches, where mouth or beak morphology were coupled to diet and genetic identification, no similar studies have been done for a fish hybrid zone in a river. We tested the correlation between morphology (body and mouth morphology), diet (stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes) and genomic combinations in different allopatric and sympatric populations for a global data set of 1330 specimens. To separate the species interaction effect from the environmental effect in sympatry, we distinguished two data sets: the first one was obtained from a highly regulated part of the river and the second was obtained from specimens coming from the less regulated part. RESULTS: The distribution of the hybrid combinations was different in the two part of the sympatric zone, whereas all the specimens presented similar overall changes in body shape and in mouth morphology. Sympatric specimens were also characterized by a larger diet behavior variance than reference populations, characteristic of an opportunistic diet. No correlation was established between the body shape (or mouth deformation) and the stable isotope signature. CONCLUSION: The Durance River is an untamed Mediterranean river despite the presence of numerous dams that split the river from upstream to downstream. The sympatric effect on morphology and the large diet behavior range can be explained by a tendency toward an opportunistic behavior of the sympatric specimens. Indeed, the similar response of the two species and their hybrids implied an adaptation that could be defined as an alternative trade-off that underline the importance of epigenetics mechanisms for potential success in a novel environment.",

    "abstract_annotation": "In adult male Marcusenius pongolensis the duration of their Electric Organ Discharge (EOD) pulses increases with body size over lifetime (267 to 818 ?s, field-measured). Spawning males have been observed to exhibit an additional, temporary pulse duration increase which probably betters their mating success but increases predation risk by electroreceptive catfish. We study the question of how the additional pulse duration increase is triggered and for how long it persists, in an attempt to understand the compromise between opposing selective forces.  We demonstrate short-term plasticity in male EOD waveform in 10 captive M. pongolensis. An increase in EOD duration was experimentally evoked in two different ways: by exchanging the familiar neighbours of experimental subjects for stranger males that were separated by plastic mesh partitions, or by separating familiar fish by plastic mesh partitions introduced into their common tank. Both treatments evoked an increase of male EOD duration. Values exceeded those found in the non-reproductive season in nature. In one male the increase of EOD duration was 5.7 fold, from 356 ?s to 2029 ?s. An increase in EOD duration was accompanied by a high level of aggression directed against the neighbours through the plastic mesh. With conditions remaining constant, EOD duration receded to 38 \u2013 50% of the maximum EOD duration after 10 weeks, or, more rapidly, when sensory contact between the fish was severely restricted by the introduction of a solid plastic wall. The short-term increase of EOD duration evoked by experimental manipulation of sensory contact with conspecifics through the plastic mesh, as reported here, resembled the changes in EOD waveform that accompanied reproduction in two captive males. Plasticity of the male EOD in pulse duration seems to be an adaptation for (1) securing a higher fitness by a sexually \\attractive\\ long-duration EOD, while (2) limiting the risk of detection by electroreceptive predators, such as the sharptooth catfish, by receding to a shorter EOD as soon as reproduction is over.",

    "abstract_annotation": "The performance of skeletal muscle is determined by the length trajectory during movement and the pattern of stimulation. Important features of the length trajectory include its amplitude, frequency, starting length and shape (velocity profile). Many of these parameters interact. For example, changing the velocity profile during shortening may change the optimum values of the other parameters. The length trajectory that maximizes performance depends on the task to be performed. During cyclical work, muscles benefit from using asymmetric cycles with longer shortening than lengthening phases. Modifying this shortening may further increase power by augmenting force output and speeding deactivation. In contrast, when accelerating an inertial load, as in jumping, the predicted \u2018optimal\u2019 velocity profile has two peak values, one early and one late in shortening. During level running at constant speed, muscles perform tasks other than producing work and power. Producing force to support the body weight is performed with nearly isometric contractions in some of the limb muscles of vertebrates. Muscles also play a key role in producing stability during running, and the intrinsic properties of the musculoskeletal system may be particularly important in stabilizing rapid running. Recently, muscles in running invertebrates and vertebrates have been described that routinely absorb large amounts of work during running. These muscles are hypothesized to play a key role in stability.",

Substrate deformations were measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a novel visualization system that enabled us to see through the soil and watch E. directus burrow in situ. PIV data, supported by soil and fluid mechanics theory, show that contraction of the valves of E. directus locally fluidizes the surrounding soil. Particle and fluid mixtures can be modeled as a Newtonian fluid with an effective viscosity based on the local void fraction. Using these models, we demonstrate that E. directus is strong enough to reach full burrow depth in fluidized soil, but not in static soil. Furthermore, we show that the method of localized fluidization reduces the amount of energy required to reach burrow depth by an order of magnitude compared with penetrating static soil, and leads to a burrowing energy that scales linearly with depth rather than with depth squared.  \n",

Here we show strong evidence indicating that the fundamental nature of free energies associated with cell/substrate interactions regulates adherent cell morphology and can be used to deduce cell modulus. These results are based on a mathematical model of biophysics and confirmed by the measured morphology of normal and cancerous liver cells adhered on a substrate. Cells select their final morphology by minimizing the total free energy in the cell/substrate system. The key mechanism by which substrate stiffness influences cell morphology is the energy tradeoff between the stabilizing influence of the cell-substrate interfacial adhesive energy and the destabilizing influence of the total elastic energies in the system. Using these findings, we establish a noninvasive methodology to determine the intrinsic modulus of cells by observing global changes in cell morphology in response to substrate stiffness. We also highlight the importance of selecting a relevant morphological index, cell roundness, that reflects the interchange between forms of energy governing cell morphology. Thus, cell-substrate interactions can be rationalized by the underlying biophysics, and cell modulus is easily measured.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Migration is a common phenomenon in many organisms, terrestrial as well as aquatic, and considerable effort has been spent to understand the evolution of migratory behaviour and its consequences for population and community dynamics. In aquatic systems, studies on migration have mainly been focused on commercially important fish species, such as salmon and trout. However, seasonal mass-migrations may occur also among other freshwater fish, e.g. in cyprinids that leave lakes and migrate into streams and wetlands in the fall and return back to the lake in spring. In a conceptual model, we hypothesized that this is an adaptive behaviour in response to seasonal changes in predation (P) and growth (G) and that migrating fish change habitat so as to minimise the ratio between predation mortality and growth rate (P/G). Estimates from bioenergetic modelling showed that seasonal changes in the ratio between predator consumption rate and prey growth rate followed the predictions from the conceptual model and also gave more precise predictions for the timing of the habitat change. By quantifying the migration of more than 1800 individually marked fish, we showed that actual migration patterns followed predictions with a remarkable accuracy, suggesting that migration patterns have evolved in response to seasonally fluctuating trade-offs between predator avoidance and foraging gains. Thus, the conceptual model provides a mechanistic understanding to mass-migration in prey fish. Further, we also show that the dominant prey fish is actually absent from the lake during a major part of the year, which should have strong implications for the dynamics of the lake ecosystem through direct and indirect food-web interactions.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Nestling birds solicit food from their parents with vigorous begging displays, involving posturing, jostling and calling. In some species, such as canaries, begging is especially costly because it causes a trade off against nestling growth. Fitness costs of begging like this are predicted by evolutionary theory because they function to resolve conflicts of interest within the family over the provision of parental investment. However, the mechanism that links these costs with nestling behaviour remains unclear. In the present study, we determine if the relationships between nestling androgen levels, nestling begging intensities and nestling growth rates are consistent with the hypothesis that testosterone is responsible for the trade-off between begging and growth. We test this idea with a correlational study, using fecal androgens as a non-invasive method for assaying nestling androgen levels. Our results show that fecal androgen levels are positively correlated with nestling begging intensity, and reveal marked family differences in each trait. Furthermore, changes in fecal androgen levels between 5 and 8 days after hatching are positively associated with changes in nestling begging intensity, and negatively associated with nestling growth during this time. Although these correlational results support our predictions, we suggest that that experimental manipulations are now required to test the direct or indirect role of testosterone in mediating the trade-off between begging and growth.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Saccadic eye movements bring objects of interest onto the high-resolution fovea. They also change the retinal location of objects, but our impression of the visual world is stable: We represent our visual world in spatiotopic coordinates. Visual stability could be the result of a null hypothesis that things do not move during a saccade, or of realigning retinal images based on an internal copy of the eye movement (remapping). The current studies disentangled these hypotheses. Subjects saccaded to peripheral targets that were displaced by different amounts during execution, and detected or discriminated displacement direction. Evidence for a null hypothesis was provided by the relatively poor perceptual performance, and evidence for remapping by the independence of performance from saccade endpoint. There was a trade-off between spatiotopic performance and saccadic plasticity: Good performance (perception of displacements) led to small compensative modifications in saccade amplitude on the next trial while poor performance led to larger modifications. Results also showed that variations in saccade amplitude also depended on the size of the retinal error and of the saccade itself. These results suggest that when faced with a discrepancy between the saccade endpoint and visual target, the visual system attributes the discrepancy to object displacement or to saccade error, in which case the subsequent saccade is corrected. This result reconciles the two hypotheses by suggesting that accurate remapping serves oculomotor accuracy but not visual stability. Internal copies of eye movements may thus be used separately to establish spatiotopic representations and to maintain oculomotor accuracy.",

After decades of research documenting behaviors that keep larvae close to natal populations, it is becoming apparent that larval behaviors in a broader spectrum of species promote long-distance migrations to offshore nursery grounds. Larvae must exert considerable control over their movements. We now show that larval emigration from estuaries is favored even over minimizing visibility to predators. An endogenous tidal vertical migration that would expedite seaward migration of Uca pugilator larvae was maintained experimentally across two tidal regimes. The periodicity of the rhythm doubled to match the local tidal regime, but larvae ascended to the surface during the daytime rather than at night. This process would conserve larval emigration but increase the visibility to predators across part of the species range. The periodicity of tidal vertical migration by Sesarma cinereum larvae failed to double and was inappropriately timed relative to both environmental cycles in the absence of a diel cycle. The timing system regulating tidally timed behaviors in these two species of crabs evidently differed. Phenotypic plasticity can conserve larval transport of both species when tidal and diel cycles are present. It may be widespread in the sea where diverse habitats are encountered across extensive species ranges.",

The underwing coverts deflect automatically along the leading edge at high angle of attack. We use high-speed digital video (500 frames/s) to analyse these deflections in greater detail during perching sequences indoors and outdoors. Outdoor perching sequences usually follow a stereotyped three-phase sequence comprising a glide, pitch-up manoeuvre and deep stall. During deep stall, the spread-eagled bird has aerodynamics reminiscent of a cross-parachute. Deployment of the underwing coverts is closely phased with wing sweeping during the pitch-up manoeuvre, and is accompanied by alula protraction. Surprisingly, active alula protraction is preceded by passive peeling from its tip. Indoor flights follow a stereotyped flapping perching sequence, with deployment of the underwing coverts closely phased with alula protraction and the end of the downstroke. We propose that the underwing coverts operate as an automatic high-lift device, analogous to a Kruger flap. We suggest that the alula operates as a strake, promoting formation of a leading-edge vortex on the swept hand-wing when the arm-wing is completely stalled, and hypothesise that its active protraction is stimulated by its initial passive deflection. These aeroelastic devices appear to be used for flow control to enhance unsteady manoeuvres, and may also provide sensory feedback.^^rdfs:Literal",

This abscission zone comprises a well-defined stretch of the basal column made up of thin-walled cells lacking a cuticularized epidermis. The penetration of the first few pollen tubes following a compatible pollination results in loss of turgor throughout the tissue, followed by loss of adhesion between the cells and ultimately disruption of the whole zone. Pectolytic enzymes are released concomitantly, but the cellulosic skeletons of the cells persist. Numerous calcium oxalate druses, identified cytochemically and by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, are present in the cells of the abscission zone; these undergo dissolution after activation of the zone, while simultaneously the druse population in the stigma stump and the upper ovary wall increases. The barrier formed by the degenerating abscission zone tissues excludes pollen tubes arriving after the initial activation and prevents the penetration of pathogens such as ergot and so has a prophylactic role. We suggest that the collapsed abscission zone forms not only a physical barrier but also a chemical one. Dissolution products of the numerous calcium oxalate druses during the breakdown of the tissue are likely to raise the calcium ion concentrations beyond the optimum for pollen-tube growth, thereby preventing further penetration. Inhibited tubes swell at the tips and may show growth disorientation before arrest, responses similar to those seen in pearl millet tubes in culture when exposed to higher than normal calcium ion concentration.^^rdfs:Literal",

Freeze-thaw-induced loss in hydraulic conductivity was studied in relation to xylem anatomy, leaf- and sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity and gas exchange characteristics of leaves. We found evidence that a trade-off between xylem transport capacity and safety from freeze-thaw-induced embolism affects photosynthetic activity in overwintering evergreens. The mean hydraulically weighted xylem vessel diameter and sapwood-specific conductivity correlated with susceptibility to freeze-thaw-induced embolism. There was also a strong correlation of hydraulic supply and demand across species; interspecific differences in stomatal conductance and CO(2) assimilation rates were correlated linearly with sapwood- and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity. Xylem vessel anatomy mediated an apparent trade-off between resistance to freeze-thaw-induced embolism and hydraulic and photosynthetic capacity during the winter. These results point to a new role for xylem functional traits in determining the degree to which species can maintain photosynthetic carbon gain despite freezing events and cold winter temperatures.",

    "abstract_annotation": "In flies of the subfamily Muscinae the egg-shell has both an outer and an inner meshwork layer, each of which holds a continuous film of air. Between these two layers is a layer to which the shell chiefly owes its mechanical strength. Holes or aeropyles through this layer connect the outer and inner films of air. Both meshwork layers consist of struts that arise perpendicularly from the middle layer. In both layers the struts are branched at their apices in a plane normal to their long axes. These horizontal branches form a fine and open hydrofuge network that provides a large water-air interface when the egg is immersed. \nWhen it rains or when the egg is otherwise immersed in water, the film of air held in the outer meshwork layer of the shell functions as a plastron. To be an efficient respiratory structure a plastron must resist wetting by both the hydrostatic pressures and the surface active materials to which it is normally exposed. The plastrons of all the Muscinae tested resist wetting in clean water by pressures far in excess of any they are likely to encounter in nature. The resistance of a plastron to hydrostatic pressures varies directly as the surface tension of the water, and the surface tension of water in contact with the decomposing materials in which the Muscinae lay their eggs is much lowered by surface active materials. These considerations seem to provide an explanation for the great resistance of the plastron of the Muscinae to wetting by excess pressures and for the paradox that the plastrons of these terrestrial eggs are more resistant to high pressures than are the plastrons of some aquatic insects that live in clean water.",

As a result the dorsal surface is usually darker than the ventral, an effect shown by many animals and known as countershading. We report here that when Sepia officinalis, Loligo vulgaris and Octopus vulgaris are rotated 1800 around the longitudinal body axis the ventral chromatophores expand, causing darkening, while the dorsal chromatophores retract, causing paling. When animals are rotated through only 900 the chromatophores on the uppermost half of the ventral and dorsal surfaces expand, while those on the lower half retract. This response, which we term the countershading reflex, can be abolished by ablating the statocysts; and experiments in which the direction of incident light is reversed show that the reflex is not driven by sensory input from the eyes. The function of the reflex is presumably to maintain countershading while the animal is momentarily disoriented; this idea is supported by the fact that it lasts only a few seconds.^^rdfs:Literal",

Bioluminescent organisms, as well as artificial devices, have to face this problem.

The morphology of the lantern of a specific firefly in the genus Photuris has been examined. The optical properties of the different parts of this lantern have been modelled, in order to determine their positive or adverse effect with regard to the global light extraction. We conclude that the most efficient pieces of the lantern structure are the misfit of the external scales (which produce abrupt roughness in air) and the lowering of the refractive index at the level of the cluster of photocytes, where the bioluminescence takes place.",

The insect, dislodged by one of the shots, falls on a ballistic path towards the water surface, where it is devoured by the first fish to arrive. We report that the archer fish can predict the point where the dislodged prey will later hit the water surface and move in a straight line towards that point, thus enabling it to arrive as fast as possible. Only about 100 ms after prey is dislodged, the fish initiate a quick turn that aligns their body axis right towards where the prey will later land, and not to the actual position of the prey at that moment. In contrast to other known examples of three-dimensional target interception in man and animals, archer fish can head straight to the predicted point of catch without the need of any further visual feedback. Moreover, archer fish can predict the point of incidence of a target, regardless of the angle at which the prey takes off with respect to the initial orientation of the fish. To perform this remarkable task, archer fish extract a minimum set of independent variables that fix the point of incidence, but do not extrapolate the target\u2019s spatial trajectory.^^rdfs:Literal",

    "abstract_annotation": "For more than 50 y ecologists have believed that spatial heterogeneity in habitat conditions promotes species richness by increasing opportunities for niche partitioning. However, a recent stochastic model combining the main elements of niche theory and island biogeography theory suggests that environmental heterogeneity has a general unimodal rather than a positive effect on species richness. This result was explained by an inherent tradeoff between environmental heterogeneity and the amount of suitable area available for individual species: for a given area, as heterogeneity increases, the amount of effective area available for individual species decreases, thereby reducing population sizes and increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinctions. Here we provide a comprehensive evaluation of this hypothesis. First we analyze an extensive database of breeding bird distribution in Catalonia and show that patterns of species richness, species abundance, and extinction rates are consistent with the predictions of the area-heterogeneity tradeoff and its proposed mechanisms. We then perform a meta-analysis of heterogeneity-diversity relationships in 54 published datasets and show that empirical data better fit the unimodal pattern predicted by the area-heterogeneity tradeoff than the positive pattern predicted by classic niche theory. Simulations in which species may have variable niche widths along a continuous environmental gradient are consistent with all empirical findings. The area-heterogeneity tradeoff brings a unique perspective to current theories of species diversity and has important implications for biodiversity conservation.",

Both absolute and specific swimming speeds during filter-feeding were significantly lower than when cruise swimming with the mouth closed, indicating basking sharks select speeds approximately 24% lower when filter-feeding. This reduction in speed during filter-feeding could be a behavioural response to avoid increased drag-induced energy costs associated with feeding at higher speeds. Non-feeding basking sharks cruised at speeds close to, but slightly faster (18%) than the optimum speed predicted by the Weihs (1977) optimal cruising speed model. In contrast, filter-feeding basking sharks swam between 29 and 39% slower than the speed predicted by the Weihs and Webb (1983) optimal filter-feeding model. This significant under-estimation in observed feeding speed compared to model predictions was most likely accounted for by surface drag effects reducing optimum speeds of tracked sharks, together with inaccurate parameter estimates used in the general model to predict optimal speeds of basking sharks from body size extrapolations.",

We tested two additional potential functions: that ink is a metabolic depressant and/or a noxious or adversive sensory stimulus. When exposed to realistic concentrations of ink from Aplysia dactylomela (Rang), none of five invertebrate species (including A. dactylomela) or two fish species significantly altered their oxygen uptake, and neither of two crab species significantly altered their heart and/or scaphognathite beat rates, suggesting that ink does not function as a metabolic depressant. In contrast, although A. dactylomela did not display strong behavioural responses to ink, behaviour of seven other invertebrates and both fish species was strongly affected by ink, supporting our hypothesis that the ink functions as an irritant. Observed behavioural changes included bristle erection by fireworms, increased mucus production by an opisthobranch, reduced feeding behaviour, increased grooming behaviour, and temporary pauses in heart and scaphognathite beating by crabs, reduced and increased activity by cryptic and exposed sea urchin species, respectively, and rapid swimming by fish. Similar behavioural changes by potential predators would likely lead to reduced predation rates on Aplysia spp. in the field.

Systems of nonlinear positive feedback, such as quorum responses, are thought to be integral to consensus decision processes that seek to optimize decision speed and accuracy while maintaining group cohesion, requirements typical of house-hunting in social insects.  Small colonies of individually marked ants (Myrmecina nipponica) were forced to relocate in experimental laboratory arenas, and given a choice of one or two alternative new sites. This species uses pheromone trails to navigate between old and new sites. A quorum threshold apparently governs the switch to brood transport, which marks the final phase of the relocation. Furthermore, there is a strong relationship between inferred quorum threshold and colony size. A demonstration of the use of a quorum rule in M. nipponica would underline the central role of quorum responses in consensus decision making, despite interspecific variation in colony size and differing modes of recruitment and navigation.^^rdfs:Literal",

    "abstract_annotation": "The standard view in biology is that all animals, from bumblebees to human beings, face a trade-off between speed and accuracy as they search for resources and mates, and attempt to avoid predators. For example, the more time a forager spends out of cover gathering information about potential food sources the more likely it is to make accurate decisions about which sources are most rewarding. However, when the cost of time spent out of cover rises (e.g. in the presence of a predator) the optimal strategy is for the forager to spend less time gathering information and to accept a corresponding decline in the accuracy of its decisions. We suggest that this familiar picture is missing a crucial dimension: the amount of effort an animal expends on gathering information in each unit of time. This is important because an animal that can respond to changing time costs by modulating its level of effort per-unit-time does not have to accept the same decrease in accuracy that an animal limited to a simple speed-accuracy trade-off must bear in the same situation. Instead, it can direct additional effort towards (i) reducing the frequency of perceptual errors in the samples it gathers or (ii) increasing the number of samples it gathers per-unit-time. Both of these have the effect of allowing it to gather more accurate information within a given period of time. We use a modified version of a canonical model of decision-making (the sequential probability ratio test) to show that this ability to substitute effort for time confers a fitness advantage in the face of changing time costs. We predict that the ability to modulate effort levels will therefore be widespread in nature, and we lay out testable predictions that could be used to detect adaptive modulation of effort levels in laboratory and field studies. Our understanding of decision-making in all species, including our own, will be improved by this more ecologically-complete picture of the three-way tradeoff between time, effort per-unit-time and accuracy.",

Mechanical power requirements have been suggested to underlie the metabolic response, but mechanical power is consistently reported to be minimal at stride rates 20-30% lower than preferred. This may be due to limitations in how total mechanical power has been computed, as well as a failure to account for the efficiency with which muscular work is done. We investigated how mechanical power and efficiency depend on stride rate in walking, with both quantities computed from the work done by the hip, knee and ankle joint moments. Our hypotheses were that mechanical power and efficiency are both optimized at the preferred stride rate, which would explain why metabolic energy expenditure is minimized at this rate. Contrary to our hypotheses, mechanical power curves exhibited plateaus that spanned stride rates lower than preferred (predicted optima: 11-12% below preferred), while net mechanical efficiency exhibited a plateau that spanned stride rates higher than preferred (predicted optimum: 8% above preferred). As expected, preferred stride rate (54.3 strides/min) was not different from the stride rate that minimized net metabolic energy expenditure (predicted optimum: 0.2% above preferred). Given that mechanical power and mechanical efficiency exhibited plateaus on opposite sides of the preferred stride rate, the preferred rate in walking likely represents a compromise between these two factors. This may also explain the relative flatness of the curve for metabolic rate in the vicinity of the preferred stride rate.",

The amount of risk animals take for a given resource depends on their energy budget but is expected also to vary between individuals of different personality types.  Grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) forage risk-sensitively indicated by longer latencies to enter a feeding platform and to start feeding as well as by relatively longer feeding time compared to nonfeeding in high-risk situations. Individual differences in risk taking were repeatable and repeatability increased with increasing risk. Individual plasticity was higher for low-risk individuals providing field evidence for coping styles. There was no relationship between individual body condition and risk-taking behaviour. Finally, boldness measured in a novel object test was correlated with risk taking in a foraging task, providing a rare ecological validation for this personality trait. These results suggest that intrinsic individual differences in boldness need to be considered as an important source of variation when testing predictions of risk-sensitive foraging using optimality approaches.",

The strength, by contrast with stiffness, of excised material varies with anatomic direction in a manner dictated by organization of the skeletal elements. In the stem, the organization imposed by axial growth and the existence of coenosteum between secondarily fused branches creates functional cleavage planes that determine the directional strength and fracture characteristics of the material. In the stem, a porous region constructed of concentric skeletal annuli surrounds the denser, centrally located set of branches, or primordia of the stem. While pores among the annuli reduce the bending strength of the stem, they also harbour skeletogenic tissue that may prevent fatigue failure from incessant flexing in surge. Shape and size, which vary among colonies, determine the hydrodynamic forces and moments that stress and break colony skeletons. Shape and skeletal strength determine, in turn, the resistance by a coral to catastrophic fracture of the stem. Shape and branching pattern in the fan beyond the stem determine the extent and pattern of breakage produced by debris swept about in storms. Below the upper limit to bathymetric distribution colonies should vary systematically in shape and size according to depth, in a way that suits each to the mechanical environment. In addition, topographic specialization for growth, feeding or reproduction among polyps in a colony may have resulted from the predictable, but limited damage inflicted by debris.

Common parasitic castrators include larval trematodes in snails, and isopod and barnacle parasites of crustaceans. The infected host (with its many unique properties) is the extended phenotype of the parasitic castrator. Because an individual parasitic castrator can usurp all the reproductive energy from a host, and that energy is limited, intra- and interspecific competition among castrators is generally intense. These parasites can be abundant and can substantially depress host density. Host populations subject to high rates of parasitic castration appear to respond by maturing more rapidly.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Habitat selection behavior is an important predator-avoidance strategy for many organisms. Its particular expression is often explained as the result of a tradeoff between avoiding antagonists and acquiring resources. However, there is need for a broader perspective on this behavior, as organisms are often simultaneously involved in complex antagonistic relationships with multiple types of enemies. We show experimentally that a tradeoff between predator and parasite avoidance may be important in the evolution of habitat selection behavior in the waterflea, Daphnia magna. In this species, negatively phototactic clones suffer less from visually hunting predators by residing in deeper and darker portions of the water column during the day. However, this behavior increases the risk of parasitic infections when the Daphnia are exposed to pond sediments containing parasite spores. Positively phototactic clones, which are at a higher risk of predation, are less exposed to parasite spores in the sediment and consequently suffer less from parasitic infection. We show that the increased risk of infection remains even if the animals change their phototactic behavior on exposure to chemical cues from fish. This tradeoff highlights a substantial cost of predator-induced changes in habitat selection behavior. Tradeoffs caused by multiple enemies may explain genetic polymorphism for habitat selection behavior in many natural populations.",

    "abstract_annotation": "During spring and summer aphids reproduce clonally and efficiently by parthenogenesis. At the end of summer they perceive the reduction of day length which triggers the production of sexual individuals - males and oviparous females - that will mate and lay overwintering cold-resistant eggs. Recent large scale transcriptomic studies allowed the discovery of transcripts and functions such as nervous and hormonal signaling involved in the early steps of detection and transduction of the photoperiodic signal. Nevertheless these experiments were performed under controlled conditions when the photoperiod was the only varying parameter. To characterize the response of aphids under natural conditions, aphids were reared outdoor both in summer and autumn and material was collected to compare their transcriptomic profile using a cDNA microarray containing around 7000 transcripts. Statistical analyses revealed that close to 5% of these transcripts (367) were differentially expressed at two developmental stages of the process in response to the autumnal environmental conditions. Functional classification of regulated transcripts confirmed the putative contribution of the neuro-endocrine system in the process. Furthermore, these experiments revealed the regulation of transcripts involved in juvenile hormone synthesis and signaling pathway, confirming the key role played by these molecules in the reproductive mode switch. Aphids placed under outdoor conditions were confronted to a range of abiotic factors such as temperature fluctuations which was confirmed by the differential expression of an important proportion of heat shock protein transcripts between the two seasons. Finally, this original approach completed the understanding of genetic programs involved in aphid phenotypic plasticity.^^rdfs:Literal",

    "abstract_annotation": "Trade-offs between investment into male sexual traits and immune function provide the foundation for some of the most prominent models of sexual selection. Post-copulatory sexual selection on the male ejaculate is intense, and therefore trade-offs should occur between investment into the ejaculate and the immune system. Examples of such trade-offs exist, including that between sperm quality and immunity in the Australian cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus. Here, we explore the dynamics of this trade-off, examining the effects that increased levels of sexual interaction have on the viability of a male's sperm across time, and the concomitant effects on immune function. Males were assigned to a treatment, whereby they cohabited with females that were sexually immature, sexually mature but incapable of copulation, or sexually mature and capable of copulation. Sperm viability of each male was then assessed at two time points: six and 13 days into the treatment, and immune function at day 13. Sperm viability decreased across the time points, but only for males exposed to treatment classes involving sexually mature females. This decrease was similar in magnitude across both sexually mature classes, indicating that costs to the expression of high sperm viability are incurred largely through levels of pre-copulatory investment. Males exposed to immature females produced sperm of low viability at both time points. Although we confirmed a weak negative association between sperm viability and lytic activity (a measure of immune response to bacterial infection) at day 13, this relationship was not altered across the mating treatment. Our results highlight that sperm viability is a labile trait, costly to produce, and subject to strategic allocation in these crickets.",

Overnight-retention tests reveal no decline in performance, but bees that had experienced cryptic predators are more prone to rejection of foraging opportunities on safe flowers than those that had experienced conspicuous predators.

These were then found in progressively deeper locations, by 2 weeks extending across the entire width of the pedicle. Concomitant with the centripetal spread of osteoclasts was the enlargement of Haversian canals, the surfaces of which became lined with osteoclasts. These widening vascular channels within the bone were filled with connective tissue, which in precasting stages formed a mesodermal pad about 1 mm thick.  In later stages, a circumferential cleft was excavated beneath the antler burr, and connective tissues from the surrounding pedicle skin invaded the space between the antler and pedicle. After casting, the ingrowing integumental tissues fused with the mesodermal tissues derived from the vascular channels of the pedicle to give rise to an incipient antler bud beneath the scab. The ingrowth of epidermis capable of de novo hair follicle formation gave rise to the skin that envelops the elongating antler.^^rdfs:Literal",

Moreover, controlled diversification experiments in ecologically relevant environments are lacking. We studied bacterial diversification in the mammalian gut, one of the most complex bacterial environments, where usually hundreds of species and thousands of bacterial strains stably coexist. Herein we show rapid genetic diversification of an Escherichia coli strain upon colonisation of previously germ-free mice. In addition to the previously described mutations in the EnvZ/OmpR operon, we describe the rapid and systematic selection of mutations in the flagellar flhDC operon and in malT, the transcriptional activator of the maltose regulon. Moreover, within each mouse, the three mutant types coexisted at different levels after one month of colonisation. By combining in vivo studies and determination of the fitness advantages of the selected mutations in controlled in vitro experiments, we provide evidence that the selective forces that drive E. coli diversification in the mouse gut are the presence of bile salts and competition for nutrients. Altogether our results indicate that a trade-off between stress resistance and nutritional competence generates sympatric diversification of the gut microbiota. These results illustrate how experimental evolution in natural environments enables identification of both the selective pressures that organisms face in their natural environment and the diversification mechanisms.",

Many animals are made buoyant by gas-filled floats, low-density organic compounds or body fluids of unusual ionic composition.

Quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization demonstrated that a tyrosinase-like enzyme with a signal peptide was highly expressed in both the heterogeneous and homogeneous granules. The contents of the granules are poorly mixed in the secreted mixture that forms the glue. Subsequent covalent cross-linking of the glue may be catalyzed by the co-secreted tyrosinase.

Pianists' peak finger heights above the keys preceding keystrokes increased as tempo increased, and were attained about one tone before keypress. These rate effects were not simply due to a strategy to increase key velocity (associated with tone intensity) of the corresponding keystroke. Greater finger heights may compensate via greater tactile feedback for a speed-accuracy tradeoff that underlies the tendency toward larger temporal variability at faster tempi. This would allow pianists to maintain high temporal accuracy when playing at fast rates. In addition, finger velocity and accelerations as pianists' fingers approached keys were sufficiently unique to allow pianists' identification with a neural-network classifier.

    "abstract_annotation": "Plants activate distinct defense responses depending on the lifestyle of the attacker encountered. In these responses, salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) play important signaling roles. SA induces defense against biotrophic pathogens that feed and reproduce on live host cells, whereas JA activates defense against necrotrophic pathogens that kill host cells for nutrition and reproduction. Cross-talk between these defense signaling pathways has been shown to optimize the response against a single attacker. However, its role in defense against multiple pathogens with distinct lifestyles is unknown. Here we show that infection with biotrophic Pseudomonas syringae, which induces SA-mediated defense, rendered plants more susceptible to the necrotrophic pathogen Alternaria brassicicola by suppression of the JA signaling pathway. This process was partly dependent on the cross-talk modulator NPR1. Surprisingly, this tradeoff was restricted to tissues adjacent to the site of initial infection; A. brassicicola infection in systemic tissue was not affected. Even more surprisingly, tradeoff occurred only with the virulent Pseudomonas strain. Avirulent strains that induced programmed cell death (PCD), an effective plant-resistance mechanism against biotrophs, did not cause suppression of JA-dependent defense. This result might be advantageous to the plant by preventing necrotrophic pathogen growth in tissues undergoing PCD. Our findings show that plants tightly control cross-talk between SA- and JA-dependent defenses in a previously unrecognized spatial and pathogen type-specific fashion. This process allows them to prevent unfavorable signal interactions and maximize their ability to concomitantly fend off multiple pathogens.",

Thus, the creation of nanoscale acoustic microphones with directional sensitivity is very difficult. The fly Ormia ochracea possesses an unusual `ear' that largely overcomes these physical constraints; attempts to exploit principles derived from O. ochracea for improved hearing aids are now in progress. Here we report that O. ochracea can behaviourally localize a salient sound source with a precision equal to that of humans. Despite its small size and minuscule interaural cues, the fly localizes sound sources to within 28 azimuth. As the fly's eardrums are less than 0.5 mm apart, localization cues are around 50 ns. Directional information is represented in the auditory system by the relative timing of receptor responses in the two ears. Low-jitter, phasic receptor responses are pooled to achieve hyperacute timecoding. These results demonstrate that nanoscale/microscale directional microphones patterned after O. ochracea have the potential for highly accurate directional sensitivity, independent of their size.

We use observational and experimental data to provide the first evidence that group members gain an increase in foraging success by responding to these vocal cues given by sentinels. Foraging pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor) spread out more, use more exposed patches, look up less often, and spend less time vigilant in response to sentinel calling. Crucially, we demonstrate that these behavioral alterations lead to an increase in biomass intake by foragers, which is likely to enhance survival. We argue that this benefit may be the reason for sentinel calling, making it a truly cooperative behavior.",

Instead, we suppose that activity differences between the left and right mandible muscles imbalance a pivot at the mandible tip and release the strike.

The phi-value distribution of FGF-1 has the majority of positions either folded-like or denatured-like in the folding transition state.

The antagonistic tradeoffs of pleiotropic mutations that can be selected under changing environments therefore lie at the foundation of evolutionary biology. However, the molecular basis of fitness tradeoffs is rarely determined in terms of how these pleiotropic mutations affect protein structure. Here we use an interdisciplinary approach to study how antagonistic pleiotropy and protein function dictate a fitness tradeoff. We challenged populations of an RNA virus, bacteriophage W6, to evolve in a novel temperature environment where heat shock imposed extreme virus mortality. A single amino acid substitution in the viral lysin protein P5 (V207F) favored improved stability, and hence survival of challenged viruses, despite a concomitant tradeoff that decreased viral reproduction. This mutation increased the thermostability of P5. Crystal structures of wild-type, mutant, and ligand-bound P5 reveal the molecular basis of this thermostabilization\u2014the Phe207 side chain fills a hydrophobic cavity that is unoccupied in the wild-type\u2014and identify P5 as a lytic transglycosylase. The mutation did not reduce the enzymatic activity of P5, suggesting that the reproduction tradeoff stems from other factors such as inefficient capsid assembly or disassembly. Our study demonstrates how combining experimental evolution, biochemistry, and structural biology can identify the mechanisms that drive the antagonistic pleiotropic phenotypes of an individual point mutation in the classic evolutionary tug-of-war between survival and reproduction.",

We analyze these sequential effects on RTs, separating error and correct responses, and identify a sequential RT tradeoff: a sequence of stimuli which yields a relatively fast RT on error trials will produce a relatively slow RT on correct trials and vice versa. We reanalyze previous data and acquire and analyze new data in a choice task with stimulus sequences generated by a first-order Markov process having unequal probabilities of repetitions and alternations. We then show that relationships among these stimulus sequences and the corresponding RTs for correct trials, error trials, and averaged over all trials are significantly influenced by the probability of alternations; these relationships have not been captured by previous models. Finally, we show that simple, sequential updates to the initial condition and thresholds of a pure drift diffusion model can account for the trends in RT for correct and error trials.

    "abstract_annotation": "Determining how species' geographic ranges are governed by current climates and how they will respond to rapid climatic change poses a major biological challenge. Geographic ranges are often spatially fragmented and composed of genetically differentiated populations that are locally adapted to different thermal regimes. Tradeoffs between different aspects of thermal performance, such as between tolerance to high temperature and tolerance to low temperature or between maximal performance and breadth of performance, suggest that the performance of a given population will be a subset of that of the species. Therefore, species-level projections of distribution might overestimate the species' ability to persist at any given location. However, current approaches to modeling distributions often do not consider variation among populations. Here, we estimated genetically-based differences in thermal performance curves for growth among 12 populations of the scarlet monkeyflower, Mimulus cardinalis, a perennial herb of western North America. We inferred the maximum relative growth rate (RGR(max)), temperature optimum (T(opt)), and temperature breadth (T(breadth)) for each population. We used these data to test for tradeoffs in thermal performance, generate mechanistic population-level projections of distribution under current and future climates, and examine how variation in aspects of thermal performance influences forecasts of range shifts. Populations differed significantly in RGR(max) and had variable, but overlapping, estimates of T(opt) and T(breadth). T(opt) declined with latitude and increased with temperature of origin, consistent with tradeoffs between performances at low temperatures versus those at high temperatures. Further, T(breadth) was negatively related to RGR(max), as expected for a specialist-generalist tradeoff. Parameters of the thermal performance curve influenced properties of projected distributions. For both current and future climates, T(opt) was negatively related to latitudinal position, while T(breadth) was positively related to projected range size. The magnitude and direction of range shifts also varied with T(opt) and T(breadth), but sometimes in unexpected ways. For example, the fraction of habitat remaining suitable increased with T(opt) but decreased with T(breadth). Northern limits of all populations were projected to shift north, but the magnitude of shift decreased with T(opt) and increased with T(breadth). Median latitude was projected to shift north for populations with high T(breadth) and low T(opt), but south for populations with low T(breadth) and high T(opt). Distributions inferred by integrating population-level projections did not differ from a species-level projection that ignored variation among populations. However, the species-level approach masked the potential array of divergent responses by populations that might lead to genotypic sorting within the species' range. Thermal performance tradeoffs among populations within the species' range had important, but sometimes counterintuitive, effects on projected responses to climatic change.",

    "abstract_annotation": "Male sexually selected vocalisations generally contain both individuality and quality cues that are crucial in intra- as well as inter-sexual communication. As individuality is a fixed feature whereas male phenotypic quality changes with age, individuality and quality cues may be subjected to different selection pressures over time. Individuality (for example, morphology of the vocal apparatus) and quality (for example, body size and dominance status) can both affect the vocal production mechanism, inducing the same components of vocalisations to convey both kinds of information. In this case, do quality-related changes to the acoustic structure of calls induce a modification of vocal cues to identity from year to year? We investigated this question in fallow deer (Dama dama), in which some acoustic parameters of vocalisations (groans) code for both individuality and quality. We carried out a longitudinal analysis of groan individuality, examining the effects of age and dominance rank on the acoustic structure of groans of the same males recorded during consecutive years. We found both age- and rank-related changes to groans; the minimum values of the highest formant frequencies and the fundamental frequency increased with the age of males and they decreased when males became more dominant. Both age- and rank-related acoustic parameters contributed to individuality. Male quality changed with age, inducing a change in quality-related parameters and thus, a modification of vocal cues to male individuality between years. The encoding of individuality and quality information in the same components of vocalisations induces a tradeoff between these two kinds of signals over time. Fallow deer vocalisations are honest signals of quality that are not fixed over time but are modified dynamically according to male quality. As they are more reliable cues to quality than to individuality, they may not be used by conspecifics to recognize a given male from one year to another, but potentially used by both sexes to assess male quality during each breeding season.",

Periodic small-scale disturbance may create a shifting dynamic of invasion and species succession in patches of new, open habitat. Such disturbances may arise from effects ranging from organic enrichment as falls of carcases or dead plants, seaweed or wood, to patchy phytodetrital deposition from the surface. Environmental patchiness of both kinds may be important in determining scale, predominantly non-competitive co-existence, particularly in a habitat lacking large-scale isolating barriers and open to chance, low-intensity recruitment from propagules of a wide taxonomic and functional spectrum of biota. Disturbance may also be expressed as diffuse, large-scale effects caused by sea bed currents. At their most extreme, 'benthic storms' erode and re-deposit sediment and create a regime of intermittent disturbance that reduces species richness.  But more moderate flow may enhance recruitment and remould the small-scale sediment landscape to create new habitat.

    "abstract_annotation": "Many deep-sea species, particularly crustaceans, cephalopods, and fish, use photophores ventrally and thus disguise their silhouettes from predators viewing them from below.  However, a predator with acute vision may be able to detect the individual photophores or may be able to detect any mismatch between the spectrum of the bioluminescence and that of the background light. The first limitation was examined by modeling the perceived images of the counterillumination of the squid Abralia veranyi and the myctophid fish Ceratoscopelus maderensis as a function of the distance and visual acuity of the viewer. The second limitation was addressed by measuring downwelling irradiance under moonlight and starlight and then modeling underwater spectra. Four water types were examined: coastal water at a depth of 5 m and oceanic water at 5, 210, and 800 m. The appearance of the counterillumination was more affected by the visual acuity of the viewer than by the clarity of the water, even at relatively large distances. Species with high visual acuity (0.11� resolution) were able to distinguish the individual photophores of some counterilluminating signals at distances of several meters, thus breaking the camouflage.  Depth and the presence or absence of moonlight strongly affected the spectrum of the background light, particularly near the surface. The increased variability near the surface was partially offset by the higher contrast attenuation at shallow depths, which reduced the sighting distance of mismatches. This research has implications for the study of spatial resolution, contrast sensitivity, and color discrimination in deep-sea visual systems.^^rdfs:Literal",

We found that ontogenetic trajectories occur in both resistance and tolerance but in opposite directions. The juvenile stage was more resistant but less tolerant than the reproductive stage. The ontogenetic switch from resistance to tolerance was consistent with the greater vulnerability of young plants to leaf damage and with the costs of resistance and tolerance found at each stage.

The position of each newly metamorphosed juvenile barnacle was mapped to the nearest 1 mm over the course of 75 tides. The total number of settled barnacles on the surfaces varied between 0 and 24.09 cm-2 The tide number at which 50 % of the total number of barnacles had settled on each surface varied between tide 23 and tide 44. A new measure describing surface roughness in relation to S. balanoides settlement using data on cyprid morphology and behaviour was devised; this index was termed Potential Settling Sites. The number of Potential Settling Sites for 2-dimensional profiles of each of the surfaces, using accurate replicas and a magnified photo mosaic, was measured. For the surfaces the total number of settlers was best related to the index Potential Settling Sitesmin Two other measures of surface roughness, ISO number, a standard engineering measure of surface relief, and fractal dimensions, were not related to settler density. Settlement pattern was found to vary with settlement density and spatial scale of analysis. A multi-scale analysis using Morisita's index suggested that S. balanoides were generally settling aggregatedly at low densities, with strongest aggregations at approximately 30 mm block sizes; it is proposed that this was related to the scale of the close exploration behaviour of the cyprid. Settlement at higher densities tended to be random aggregated settlement at low densities could be related to the requirement to find a mate in close proximity, whereas avoidance of aggregated settlement by S. balanoides at higher densities could potentially be an intraspecific competition avoidance technique. Nearest neighbour analysis at low settlement densities (0.5 to 1.75 cm-2) found that cyprids settled aggregatedly to at least the first nearest neighbour; it is proposed that this is related to small-scale gregarious settlement behaviour.^^rdfs:Literal",

We also provide photographic documentation of an eyeball of about 27 cm with a 9 cm pupil in a giant squid, and we predict that, below 600 m depth, it would allow detection of sperm whales at distances exceeding 120 m. With this long range of vision, giant squid get an early warning of approaching sperm whales. Because the sonar range of sperm whales exceeds 120 m, we hypothesize that a well-prepared and powerful evasive response to hunting sperm whales may have driven the evolution of huge dimensions in both eyes and bodies of giant and colossal squid.

In contrast to predictions however, temporal resolution was similar between chickadees and nuthatches despite broader auditory filters in chickadees. These results and the results of a model simulation exploring the effect of broadened auditory filter bandwidth on temporal resolution in the auditory periphery strongly suggest that frequency resolution constrains temporal resolution in songbirds.

Alternative strategies of sexual reproduction (inbreeding vs. outcrossing) have divergent effects on population genetic structure and could thereby broadly influence trait evolution. However, the broader evolutionary consequences of mating system transitions remain poorly understood, with the exception of traits related to reproduction itself (e.g., pollination). Across a phylogeny of 56 wild species of Solanaceae (nightshades), we show here that the repeated, unidirectional transition from ancestral self-incompatibility (obligate outcrossing) to self-compatibility (increased inbreeding) leads to the evolution of an inducible (vs. constitutive) strategy of plant resistance to herbivores. We demonstrate that inducible and constitutive defense strategies represent evolutionary alternatives and that the magnitude of the resulting macroevolutionary tradeoff is dependent on the mating system. Loss of self-incompatibility is also associated with the evolution of increased specificity in induced plant resistance. We conclude that the evolution of sexual reproductive variation may have profound effects on plant-herbivore interactions, suggesting a new hypothesis for the evolution of two primary strategies of plant defense.",

This study examined how the petioles manage to achieve adequate rigidity to do this, while allowing extensive and reversible reconfiguration in high winds. Morphological and anatomical examination of the petioles and leaves of Musa textilis suggested how these two apparently incompatible abilities are achieved. The hollow U-shaped section of the petiole and the longitudinal stiffening elements in its outer skin give it adequate rigidity, while its ventral curvature help support the leaf without the need for thick lateral veins. These features, however, also allow the petiole to reconfigure by twisting away from the wind, while the leaf can fold away. In addition, two sets of internal structures, longitudinal partitions and transverse stellate parenchyma plates, help prevent dorsoventral flattening, allowing the petiole to flex further away from the wind without buckling. These ideas were tested and verified by a range of mechanical tests. Simple four-point-bending and torsion tests showed that the petioles are indeed far more compliant in torsion than in bending. Axial bending tests and crushing tests showed that petioles could be flexed twice as far and were four times as resistant to dorsoventral flattening when intact than when the internal tissue is removed. The banana petiole, therefore, seems to be an excellent example of natural integrated mechanical design.^^rdfs:Literal",

    "abstract_annotation": "Life history theory predicts tradeoffs among reproductive traits, but the physiological mechanisms underlying such tradeoffs remain unclear. Here we examine reproductive tradeoffs and their association with yolk steroids in an oviparous lizard. Female leopard geckos lay two eggs in a clutch, produce multiple clutches in a breeding season, and reproduce for several years. We detected a significant tradeoff between egg size and the number of clutches laid by females during their first two breeding seasons. Total reproductive effort was strongly condition-dependent in the first season, but much less so in the second season. Although these and other tradeoffs were unmistakable, they were not associated with levels of androstenedione, oestradiol, or testosterone in egg yolk. Female condition and egg size, however, were inversely related to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels in egg yolk. Finally, steroid levels in egg yolk were not directly related to steroid levels in the maternal circulation when follicles were developing, indicating that steroid transfer to eggs is regulated. These findings suggest that maternal allocation of DHT could mitigate tradeoffs that lead to poor offspring quality (i.e. poor female condition) and small offspring size (i.e. small egg size).",

Proteolytic activation of structural proteins maximizes the potential for bonding interactions with other proteins and with the surface. Transglutaminase cross-linking reinforces cement integrity. Remarkably, epitopes and sequences homologous to bovine trypsin and human transglutaminase were identified in barnacle cement with tandem mass spectrometry and/or western blotting. Akin to blood clotting, the peptides generated during proteolytic activation functioned as signal molecules, protein aggregation to barnacle larval settlement. There is a highly conserved protein polymerization mechanism.  Barnacle cement polymerization is a specialized form of wound healing.

    "abstract_annotation": "Sunlight is attenuated rapidly in the ocean, resulting in little visually useful light reaching deeper than 1000 m in even the clearest water. To maximize sensitivity to the relatively brighter downwelling sunlight, to view the silhouette of animals above them, and to increase the binocular overlap of their eyes, many mesopelagic animals have developed upward-pointing tubular eyes. However, these sacrifice the ability to detect bioluminescent and reflecting objects in other directions. Thus, some mesopelagic fish with tubular eyes extend their visual fields laterally and/or ventrally by lensless ocular diverticula, which are thought to provide unfocused images, allowing only simple detection of objects, with little spatial resolution. Here, we show that a medial mirror within the ventrally facing ocular diverticulum of the spookfish, Dolichopteryx longipes, consisting of a multilayer stack derived from a retinal tapetum, is used to reflect light onto a lateral retina. The reflective plates are not orientated parallel to the surface of the mirror. Instead, plate angles change progressively around the mirror, and computer modeling indicates that this provides a well-focused image. This is the first report of an ocular image being formed in a vertebrate eye by a mirror.",

Guided by engineering theory, the skeleton is dissected into its functional parts and an approximation made of the stresses sustained by each.  The whole body acts as a unit sustaining compressive forces across its oral surface and tensile stresses across its aboral surface. Two points of maximum stress are identified: the aboral ridge of the ray close to the disk and the inferior transverse ambulacral muscle (ITAM). Structural stability is conferred upon the former by virtue of its position in the body and upon the latter by the inclusion of strong tensile fibres in parallel with the muscle.  \n",

    "abstract_annotation": "Water striders Gerridae are insects of characteristic length 1 cm and weight 10 dynes that reside on the surface of ponds, rivers, and the open ocean. Their weight is supported by the surface tension force generated by curvature of the free surface and they propel themselves by driving their central pair of hydrophobic legs in a sculling motion. Previous investigators have assumed that the hydrodynamic propulsion of the water strider relies on momentum transfer by surface waves1. This assumption leads to Denny's paradox: infant water striders, whose legs are too slow to generate waves, should be incapable of propelling themselves along the surface. We here resolve this paradox through reporting the results of high-speed video and particle tracking studies. Experiments reveal that the strider transfers momentum to the underlying fluid not primarily through capillary waves, but rather through hemispherical vortices shed by its driving legs. This insight guided us in constructing a self-contained mechanical water strider whose means of propulsion is analogous to that of its natural counterpart.",

These notably include manipulation of the host, capture of prey and defense against competitors and predators thanks to endocrine and immune systems disruptors, neurotoxic, cytolytic and pain-inducing venom components. Recent works indicate that many hymenopteran species, whatever their life style, have also evolved a venom with properties which enable it to regulate microbial infections, both in stinging and stung animals. In contrast to biting insects and their salivary glands, stinging Hymenoptera seem to constitute an under-exploited ecological niche for agents of vector-borne disease. Few parasitic or mutualistic microorganisms have been reported to be hosted by venom-producing organs or to be transmitted to stung animals. This may result from the presence of potent antimicrobial molecules in venoms, histological features of venom apparatuses and selective effects of venoms on immune defenses of targeted organisms. The present paper reviews for the first time the venom antimicrobial potential of solitary and social Hymenoptera in molecular, ecological, and evolutionary perspectives.",

This behaviour prevailed in the first-born dominant nestlings rather than the last-born subordinate nestlings. It was also more prevalent in females.  In 81% of the nests, males stole food  from siblings more frequently. We suggest that food sharing has evolved in the barn owl because parents store prey items in their nest that can be used by the offspring to feed their nestmates and so derive indirect (kin selection) or direct benefits (pseudoreciprocity or by-product mutualism). The cost of feeding siblings may be relatively low for dominant individuals while the indirect genetic benefits could be high given that extrapair paternity is infrequent in this species. Thus, in situations in which young animals have access to more food resources than they currently need, they can altruistically share them with their siblings.^^rdfs:Literal",

    "abstract_annotation": "In the squid Alloteuthis subulata and Loligo vulgaris the mantle muscle is almost transparent. Stripes of iridophores run along the length of each side of the mantle, some of which, when viewed at normal incidence in white light, reflect red, others green or blue. When viewed obliquely, the wavebands best reflected move towards the blue/ultraviolet end of the spectrum and their reflections are almost 100% polarised. These are properties of quarter-wavelength stacks predicted in theoretical analyses made by Huxley and Land. The reflecting surfaces of the individual iridophores are almost flat and, in a given stripe, these surfaces are within a few degrees of being parallel. Both species of squid have conspicuous, brightly coloured reflectors above their eyes. These \u2018eyespots\u2019 have iridescent layers similar to those found on the mantle but are overlaid by a green fluorescent layer that does not change colour or become polarised as it is viewed more obliquely. In the sea, all reflections from the iridophore stripes will be largely confined to the blue-green parts of the spectrum and all reflections in other wavebands, such as those in the red and near ultraviolet, will be weak. The functions of the iridophores reflecting red at normal incidence must be sought in their reflections of blue-green at oblique angles of incidence. These squid rely for their camouflage mainly on their transparency, and the ventral iridophores and the red, green and blue reflective stripes must be used mainly for signalling. The reflectivities of some of these stripes are relatively low, allowing a large fraction of the incident light to be transmitted into the mantle cavity. Despite their low reflectivities, the stripes are very conspicuous when viewed from some limited directions because they reflect light from directions for which the radiances are much higher than those of the backgrounds against which they are viewed. The reflective patterns seen, for example, by neighbouring squid when schooling depend on the orientation of the squid in the external light field and the position of the squid relative to these neighbours.  \n",

    "abstract_annotation": "The compound eye of insects imposes a tradeoff between resolution and sensitivity, which should exacerbate with diminishing eye size. Tiny lenses are thought to deliver poor acuity because of diffraction; nevertheless, miniature insects have visual systems that allow a myriad of lifestyles. Here, we investigate whether size constraints result in an archetypal eye design shared between miniature dipterans by comparing the visual performance of the fruit fly Drosophila and the killer fly Coenosia. These closely related species have neural superposition eyes and similar body lengths (3 to 4 mm), but Coenosia is a diurnal aerial predator, whereas slow-flying Drosophila is most active at dawn and dusk. Using in vivo intracellular recordings and EM, we report unique adaptations in the form and function of their photoreceptors that are reflective of their distinct lifestyles. We find that although these species have similar lenses and optical properties, Coenosia photoreceptors have three- to fourfold higher spatial resolution and rate of information transfer than Drosophila. The higher performance in Coenosia mostly results from dramatically diminished light sensors, or rhabdomeres, which reduce pixel size and optical cross-talk between photoreceptors and incorporate accelerated phototransduction reactions. Furthermore, we identify local specializations in the Coenosia eye, consistent with an acute zone and its predatory lifestyle. These results demonstrate how the flexible architecture of miniature compound eyes can evolve to match information processing with ecological demands.",

    "abstract_annotation": "The keels of the carapace of of the smooth trunkfish produce leading edge vortices capable of generating self-correcting trimming forces during swimming.  The ventral keels of all three different forms produced leading edge vortices that grew in circulation along the bodies, resembling the leading edge vortices produced around deltawinged aircraft. These spiral vortices form above the keels and increase in circulation as pitch angle becomes more positive, and form below the keels and increase in circulation as pitch angle becomes more negative. Vortices also form along the eye ridges of all boxfish. In the spotted boxfish, which is largely trapezoidal in cross section, a dorsal vortex grows posterior to the eye ridge. When all three boxfishes were positioned at various yaw angles, regions of strongest concentrated vorticity formed in far-field locations of the carapace compared with near-field areas, and vortex circulation was greatest posterior to the center of mass. In general, regions of localized low pressure correlated well with regions of attached, concentrated vorticity, especially around the ventral keels. Although other features of the carapace also affect flow patterns and pressure distributions in different ways, the integrated effects of the flows are consistent for all forms: they produce trimming self-correcting forces, which we measured directly using the force balance. These data together with previous work on smooth trunkfish indicate that body-induced vortical flows are a common mechanism that is probably significant for trim control in all species of tropical boxfishes.

In this study, I analyzed effects of different direct defenses of wild lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) that were simultaneously exposed to a fungal pathogen (Colletotrichum lindemuthianum) and an insect herbivore, the Mexican bean beetle (Epilachna varivestis). Although plants were derived from spatially widely separated populations, I observed a common tradeoff between resistance to pathogens and herbivores. Plants with high levels of anti-herbivore defense (cyanogenesis) showed low levels of resistance to pathogens (polyphenol oxidase activity and phenolic compounds), and vice versa. Competition for resources generally is considered to be the basis for tradeoffs. However, I report direct inhibition of polyphenol oxidase by cyanide, making simultaneous expression of both defenses at high levels impossible. I argue that populations composed of individuals investing in one type of defense have an advantage in environments that periodically favor either pathogen or herbivore plant antagonists.",

When environments improve, they must quickly resume growth to maximize their share of limited nutrients. Cells with higher stress resistance often survive longer stress durations at the cost of needing more time to resume growth, a strong disadvantage in competitive environments. Here we analyze the basis of optimal strategies that microorganisms can use to cope with this tradeoff. We explicitly show that the prototypical inverse relation between stress resistance and growth rate can explain much of the different types of behavior observed in stressed microbial populations. Using analytical mathematical methods, we determine the environmental parameters that decide whether cells should remain vegetative upon stress exposure, downregulate their metabolism to an intermediate optimum level, or become dormant. We find that cell-cell variability, or intercellular noise, is consistently beneficial in the presence of extreme environmental fluctuations, and that it provides an efficient population-level mechanism for adaption in a deteriorating environment. Our results reveal key novel aspects of responsive phenotype switching and its role as an adaptive strategy in changing environments.",
