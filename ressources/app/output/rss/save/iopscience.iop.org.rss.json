[{"title":"Computational investigation of wing-body interaction and its lift enhancement effect in hummingbird forward flight","authors":"Junshi Wang, Yan Ren, Chengyu Li, Haibo Dong","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"7 June 2019","abstract":"A lift enhancement mechanism due to wing-body interaction (WBI) was previously proved to be significant in the forward flight of insect flyers with wide-shape bodies, such as cicada. In order to further explore WBI and its lift enhancement effect in a flapping flight platform with different wing and body shapes, numerical investigations of WBI were performed on the forward flight of a hummingbird in this paper. A high-fidelity computational model of a hummingbird in forward flight was modeled with its geometric complexity. The wing kinematics of flapping flight were prescribed using experimental data from previous literature. An immersed-boundary-method-based incompressible Navier‒Stokes solver was used for the 3D flow simulations of the wing-body system. Analyses on aerodynamic performances and vortex dynamics of three models, including the wing-body (WB), wing-only (WO), and body-only (BO) models, were made to examine the effect of WBI. Results have shown significant overall lift enhancement (OLE) due to WBI. The total lift force of the WB model increased by 29% compared with its WO/BO counterparts. Vortex dynamics results showed formations of unique body vortex pairs on the dorsal thorax of hummingbird where low-pressure zones were created to generate more body lift. Significant interactions between body vortex and leading-edge vortex (LEV) were observed, resulting in strengthened LEVs near the wing root and enhanced wing lift generation during downstroke. Parametric studies showed strong OLEs over wide ranges of body angle and advance ratio, respectively. The contribution of OLE from the hummingbird body increased with increasing body angle, and the wing pair's contribution increased as advance ratio increased. Results from this paper supported that lift enhancement due to WBI is potentially a general mechanism adopted by different kinds of flapping-wing flyers, and demonstrated the potential of WBI in the design of flapping-wing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) that pursue higher performance.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046010"},{"title":"Numerical prediction of aerodynamic performance for a flying fish during gliding flight","authors":"Jian Deng, Lingxin Zhang, Zhiyou Liu, Xuerui Mao","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"7 June 2019","abstract":"Flying fish is a family of unique aerial–aquatic animals, which can both swim in the water and glide over the sea surface. Most previous studies on their aerodynamic characteristics were based on field observations or measurements of their morphometric parameters. In the present study, we consider three different flying fish models, of which the preliminary one mimics the Cypselurus hiraii in the pectoral fin morphology, following a previous wind tunnel experiment (Park and Choi 2010 J. Exp. Biol. 213 3269–79). Their aerodynamic performances are numerically studied by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The maximum lift force coefficient of 1.03 is reached at the angle of attack , and the maximum lift-to-drag ratio of 4.7 is achieved at . By choosing appropriately the center of gravity, the flying fish model is proved to be longitudinally stable, according to the negative slope of pitching moment profile. Furthermore, we build a three-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) dynamic model in the longitudinal plane based on the aerodynamic coefficients obtained in our simulations, to predict its gliding performance. The results show that the flying fish can achieve a distance up to 45.4 m, and reach a height of 13.2 m, indicating an extraordinary gliding performance. Our numerical simulations are consistent with previous experimental results and theoretical prediction, which can be taken as the basis of further research on robotic flying fish.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046009"},{"title":"Analysis of the role of wind information for efficient chemical plume tracing based on optogenetic silkworm moth behavior","authors":"Shunsuke Shigaki, Shoma Haigo, Cesar Hernandez Reyes, Takeshi Sakurai, Ryohei Kanzaki, Daisuke Kurabayashi, Hideki Sezutsu","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"31 May 2019","abstract":"Many animals use olfactory information to search for feeding areas and other individuals in real time and with high efficiency. We focus on the chemical plume tracing (CPT) ability of male silkworm moths and investigate an efficient CPT strategy for an autonomous robot. In the case of flying insects, the wind direction is an important factor in CPT, because the wind carries odors amongst other environmental information. However, whether the same phenomenon occurs in the walking silkworm moth has not been investigated. Therefore, we examine how the silkworm moth uses wind information during CPT. To accurately investigate the response to the wind direction, we introduce an optogenetic approach that replaces the odor stimulation with light stimulation, allowing us to separate the 'wind stimulus' from the 'odor stimulus'. We examine how the moth uses wind direction information in a biological experiment, and find that the movement speed is significantly reduced when the wind speed is relatively fast (1.0 m s−1). By implementing this phenomenon in an autonomous robot, we can improve the successful search rate over that of the conventional moth-inspired algorithm. Regarding the search time, the proposed algorithm finds the odor source faster in a low-frequency odorant emission environment, whereas the search is slower than the conventional method when the odor frequency is higher. Therefore, switching from the use of wind direction information to odor information according to the frequency with which the odor is encountered leads to efficient CPT performance.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046006"},{"title":"Evaluation of silicone elastomers as structural materials for microstructured adhesives","authors":"Aiva Simaite, Matthew Spenko","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"31 May 2019","abstract":"Microstructured (sometimes referred to as gecko-like) adhesives have numerous advantages over flat films, especially for practical applications on non-ideal surfaces that may be uneven or contaminated with dust. However, due to interdependence among material surface and bulk properties, the best material to fabricate such adhesives is still unknown. In this work, we analyzed eleven commercially available silicone elastomers to evaluate their use as flat and microstructured adhesives to address multiple material related questions that may impact the choice of the 'best' material for microstructured dry adhesives. To illustrate the applicability of the measured properties to modeling microstructured surfaces, we use stalk-shaped microstructures, whose contact mechanics are well understood. We demonstrate that there is no correlation between the adhesion strength of flat and microstructured adhesives; while bulk dissipation is the most important factor influencing the adhesion strength of flat elastomers, after microstructurization, interface toughness becomes more important. Therefore, microstructured elastomers loaded with high surface energy additives may demonstrate higher adhesion than their flat counterparts. We also compare the adhesion of flat and microstructured silicone elastomers on rough substrates. In this case, we show that while flat elastomer adhesion decreases with increasing substrate roughness, microstructured silicone adhesion actually increases with increasing roughness up to 0.19 m. This is the first time an increase in adhesion strength on rough surfaces is reported for materials stiffer than 1.0 MPa.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046005"},{"title":"A minimal longitudinal dynamic model of a tailless flapping wing robot for control design","authors":"K M Kajak, M Karásek, Q P Chu, G C H E de Croon","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"6 June 2019","abstract":"Recently, several insect- and hummingbird-inspired tailless flapping wing robots have been introduced. However, their flight dynamics, which are likely to be similar to that of their biological counterparts, remain yet to be fully understood. We propose a minimal dynamic model that is not only validated with experimental data, but also able to predict the consequences of various important design changes. Specifically, the model captures the flapping-cycle-averaged longitudinal dynamics, considering the main aerodynamic effects. We validated the model with flight data captured with a tailless flapping wing robot, the DelFly Nimble, for air speeds from near-hover flight up to 3.5 m s−1. Moreover, the model succeeds in predicting the effects of changes to the center of mass location, and to the control system gains. Hence, the model is suitable even for the initial control design phase. To demonstrate this, we have used the simulation model to tune the robot's control system for higher speeds. Using the new control parameters on the real robot improved its maximal stable speed from 4 m s−1 to 7 m s−1.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046008"},{"title":"Biomimetic 3D printed lightweight constructions: a comparison of profiles with various geometries for efficient material usage inspired by square-shaped plant stems","authors":"Ruwen Kaminski, Thomas Speck, Olga Speck","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"6 June 2019","abstract":"Within a bottom-up approach in biomimetics, this study was inspired by the plant motherwort (Leonurus cardiaca), which has stems divided longitudinally into hollow internodes and solid nodes, a lightweight concept well-known in biology. The square cross-sections show a specific geometric arrangement of various tissues, each with different mechanical properties. We have used CAD software and selective laser sintering technology to produce (1) extruded hollow profiles with various cross-sections analogous to internodes, and (2) integrated additional elements mimicking nodes. The design of the individual profiles with their different geometries is based on an increasing degree of abstraction, starting with profile A, which comes closest to the plant model, through profile B in the form of a greatly simplified material distribution, to profile C with the simplest geometry of a square hollow profile. In the context of resource-saving constructions, we have determined the flexural and torsional stiffness, the twist to bend ratio, and the lightweight efficiency of each individual profile. In general, profiles A, B, and C and all profiles from the A- and C-family show higher torsional stiffness than flexural stiffness. However, the profiles of the B-family exhibit no such uniform mechanical behavior. Interestingly, profile A has a higher lightweight efficiency than profile B but a lower efficiency than the most abstracted profile C. This indicates that a simple blueprint of nature is not useful, because, in plants, the geometric designs of various tissues and of globally and locally adaptable material properties are coupled to optimize performance based on multifunctionality. In contrast, 3D laser sintered profiles consist of a single isotropic and homogeneous material with defined material properties and therefore show different flexural and torsional efficiency because of their diverse geometries alone. These results reveal the influences of the geometric arrangement on the bending and torsional stiffness of the plant without interference from variations in material properties (reverse biomimetics).","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046007"},{"title":"A force-measuring and behaviour-recording system consisting of 24 individual 3D force plates for the study of single limb forces in climbing animals on a quasi-cylindrical tower","authors":"Aihong Ji, Shanshan Yuan, Thomas Endlein, Iain D C Hill, Wei Wang, Huan Wang, Nan Jiang, Zhihui Zhao, W Jon P Barnes, Zhendong Dai","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"24 May 2019","abstract":"This study describes the design of a new force measuring array with a quasi-cylindrical surface for measuring the 3D ground reaction forces of animals climbing on a surface with high curvature. This force-measuring array was assembled from 24 individual 3D force sensors, each with a resolution at the millinewton (mN) level, which were installed from top to bottom in four columns and six rows, with sensors in neighbouring columns staggered in height. Three cameras were used to simultaneously record the climbing behaviours of animals (in these experiments tree frogs) on the cylinder-like force measuring array. We were thus able to simultaneously record the ground reaction forces of each of the four limbs of tree frogs (here six individuals of the Chinese gliding or flying frog, Rhacophorus dennysi, with forelimb spans in the range 163–201 mm) climbing or descending both smooth and rough surfaces on a quasi-cylindrical structure with an overall diameter of 79 mm. We describe the design and calibration of the individual force sensors, their installation and arrangement on the quasi-cylindrical climbing tower, the recording of ground reaction forces and climbing behaviour, data transformations necessitated by the angular relationship of neighbouring sensors, and data processing using MATLAB scripts. Additionally, we present preliminary data on the use of a clamping grip by climbing frogs and the existence of small pull-off forces that aid toe-pad detachment at the end of each locomotor stance phase.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046004"},{"title":"Aerodynamic effects of varying solid surface area of bristled wings performing clap and fling","authors":"Mitchell P Ford, Vishwa T Kasoju, Manikantam G Gaddam, Arvind Santhanakrishnan","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"17 May 2019","abstract":"The smallest flying insects with body lengths under 2 mm show a marked preference for wings consisting of a thin membrane with long bristles, and the use of clap and fling kinematics to augment lift at Reynolds numbers (Re) of approximately 10. Bristled wings have been shown to reduce drag forces in clap and fling, but the aerodynamic roles of several bristled wing geometric variables remain unclear. This study examines the effects of varying the ratio of membrane area (A M) to total wing area (A T) on aerodynamic forces and flow structures generated during clap and fling at Re on the order of 10. We also examine the aerodynamic consequences of scaling bristled wings to Re  =  120, relevant to flight of fruit flies. We analyzed published forewing images of 25 species of thrips (Thysanoptera) and found that A M/A T ranged from 14% to 27%, as compared to 11% to 88% previously reported for smaller-sized fairyflies (Hymenoptera). These data were used to develop physical bristled wing models with A M/A T ranging from 15% to 100%, which were tested in a dynamically scaled robotic clap and fling model. At all Re, bristled wings produced slightly lower lift coefficients (C L) when compared to solid wings, but provided significant drag reduction. At Re  =  10, largest values of peak lift over peak drag ratios were generated by wing models with A M/A T similar to thrips forewings (15% to 30%). Circulation of the leading edge vortex and trailing edge vortex decreased with decreasing A M/A T during clap and fling at Re  =  10. Decreased chordwise circulation near the wing tip, vortex shedding, and interaction between flow structures from clap with those from fling resulted in lowering C L generated via clap and fling at Re  =  120 as compared to Re  =  10. Clap and fling becomes less beneficial at Re  =  120, regardless of the drag reduction provided by bristled wings.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046003"},{"title":"Self-supervised learning of the biologically-inspired obstacle avoidance of hexapod walking robot","authors":"Petr Čížek, Jan Faigl","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"3 May 2019","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an integrated biologically inspired visual collision avoidance approach that is deployed on a real hexapod walking robot. The proposed approach is based on the Lobula giant movement detector (LGMD), a neural network for looming stimuli detection that can be found in visual pathways of insects, such as locusts. Although a superior performance of the LGMD in the detection of intercepting objects has been shown in many collision avoiding scenarios, its direct integration with motion control is an unexplored topic. In our work, we propose to utilize the LGMD neural network for visual interception detection with a central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion control of a hexapod walking robot that are combined in the controller based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. Moreover, we propose self-supervised learning of the integrated controller to autonomously find a suitable setting of the system using a realistic robotic simulator. Thus, individual neural networks are trained in a simulation to enhance the performance of the controller that is then experimentally verified with a real hexapod walking robot in both collision and interception avoidance scenario and navigation in a cluttered environment.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046002"},{"title":"Flow field perception based on the fish lateral line system","authors":"Yonggang Jiang, Zhiqiang Ma, Deyuan Zhang","origin":"Topical Review","pub_date":"3 May 2019","abstract":"Fish are able to perceive the surrounding weak flow and pressure variations with their mechanosensory lateral line system, which consists of a superficial lateral line for flow velocity detection and a canal lateral line for flow pressure gradient perception.
