		<outline text="### What is this?">
			<outline text="It's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davefeedread&quot;&gt;Node package&lt;/a&gt; that contains everything you need to read a feed. "></outline>
			<outline text="It builds on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser&quot;&gt;feedParser package&lt;/a&gt;. It's simpler to call, no need to master &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream&quot;&gt;streams&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconv&quot;&gt;iconv&lt;/a&gt;. "></outline>
			<outline text="You can also parse a string, so you can deal with files that contain feed data, not just feeds accessible over the web. Or the feed text could come from a database. "></outline>
			<outline text="Because we use feedParser, we handle all the formats and variability that it handles. "></outline>
			<outline text="It's an entry-level feed parser that will be useful to people who haven't mastered all of JavaScript. "></outline>
			</outline>
		<outline text="### Why?">
			<outline text="Sometimes you need to quickly read a feed and do something with it, and don't have time for a major project. This package is for those times. "></outline>
			<outline text="It also provides good sample code for more advanced feed reading projects. "></outline>
			<outline text="And as you may have heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader/&quot;&gt;RSS is coming back&lt;/a&gt; in a big way, and it's spring, and time for a little cleaning. ;-)"></outline>
