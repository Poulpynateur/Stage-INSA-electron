[{"authors":"Shannon Hall, Nature magazine","pub_date":"June 12, 2019","abstract":"The helicopter fell like a stone. It dropped by more than 1,500 metres over Maryland, twisting slightly as the ground grew rapidly closer. Although this was all according to plan, that didn’t settle James Garvin’s nerves. Nor did the realization that his seat belt wasn’t fully fastened—a moment that sent his heart rate skyrocketing.\n\nThen, a mere 6 metres above the ground, the ride got even wilder when the pilots pulled the aircraft out of the fall and climbed skywards, only to fall again. The helicopter dropped ten times that day. And each time, Garvin pointed a camera towards the ground through the open door in an attempt to measure the topography of a rock quarry below—from massive boulders to smooth sheets of sand. Although his interests were hardly terrestrial.\n\nGarvin, the chief scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is the principal investigator on a proposed mission to Venus that would drop a probe through its atmosphere. That’s why he hired two pilots in August 2016 to plunge a helicopter towards the ground while he tested what a Venus probe might be able to photograph. The harrowing ride was worth it: researchers would love to get their hands on pictures of Venus with so much detail that the scenery would become familiar. “These images would be like you landing in your backyard,” he says.\n\nGarvin is not the only scientist preparing such a daring mission. Nearly every space agency around the globe is currently sketching a proposal to explore our long-neglected neighbour. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will be first to lift off when it launches an orbiter to Venus in 2023. The United States could follow close behind. Garvin and his colleagues are one of a handful of groups that will soon propose missions to NASA that, if selected, would take off in 2025. The European Space Agency (ESA) is currently considering a proposal to send an orbiter to Venus in 2032. And the Russian space agency Roscosmos is working in collaboration with the United States to send a daring mission to the planet any time from 2026 to 2033, which would include an orbiter, a lander that would send back short-term readings and a research station that would survive for much longer.\n\nThe new-found interest stands in stark contrast to the fact that nations have long overlooked Venus in favour of chasing Mars, asteroids and other planets. Over the past 65 years, for example, NASA has sent 11 orbiters and 8 landers to Mars, but just 2 orbiters to Venus—and none since 1994. This has not been for lack of scientific interest. Since the mid-1990s, U.S. scientists alone have submitted nearly 30 Venus proposals to NASA. None has been approved.\n\nBut momentum is building to explore Venus, in part because scientists say it could hold the secret to understanding what makes a planet habitable. Once Earth’s twin, today Venus is a hellish abode where surface temperatures reach more than 400 °C, atmospheric pressures slam down with enough force to crush heavy machinery and clouds of sulfuric acid blow through the sky. If researchers could decipher why conditions on Venus turned so deadly, that would help them to assess whether life might exist on some of the thousand-plus rocky worlds that astronomers are discovering throughout the Galaxy.\n\nAs the scientific justification has grown for exploring Venus, planetary scientists are dreaming up new ways to study the planet and are building technology in the laboratory that can survive the horrendous conditions on its surface. And with India leading the way, there might soon be a parade of probes heading towards the second rock from the Sun.\n\n“It might be the start of a new decade of Venus,” says Thomas Widemann, a planetary scientist at the Paris Observatory.\n\nDouble trouble\n\nWhen humanity initially reached towards the stars, it ventured to Venus. Our neighbour was the target of the first successful interplanetary probe (United States, 1962); the first planet on which a mission crashed (Soviet Union, 1965); and the first alien world to host a successful landing (Soviet Union, 1970). It was during this space race to Venus that scientists discovered a torrid and toxic world. That could explain why interest in Venus dwindled. Scientists quickly realized that this planet would not be a home for future human exploration, nor an outlet on which to search for life. It would be downright difficult to study at all, even for short amounts of time.\n\nAnd yet in so many ways—size, density, chemical make-up—Venus is Earth’s double. Recent research has even suggested that it might have looked like Earth for three billion years, with vast oceans that could have been friendly to life. “That’s what sets my imagination on fire,” says Darby Dyar, a planetary scientist at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. “If that’s the case, there was plenty of time for evolution to kick into action.”\n\nThat could mean that Venus was (somewhat surprisingly) the first habitable planet in the Solar System—a place where life was just as likely to arise as it was on Earth. That alone is a reason to return to the former ocean world. “Why are we investing so much time looking for life on Mars when it only had liquid water for 400 million years?” Dyar asks. “And then there’s Venus with three billion years of water and no one loves her.”\n\nYet there’s no question that something went terribly wrong. Although Earth and Venus began in a similar fashion, the two have wandered down drastically different evolutionary paths—diverging perhaps as recently as 715 million years ago. That might seem like a reason not to visit, but scientists now argue that it makes the planet even more intriguing. If researchers could only understand what caused Venus to undergo such a deadly metamorphosis, they might gain a better understanding of what caused Earth to become such a haven for life.\n\n“Venus plays a key role in understanding ourselves here—how life evolved on our own planet,” says Adriana Ocampo, science programme manager at NASA headquarters in Washington DC.\n\nIt is a crucial question now that astronomers have uncovered thousands of planets outside our Solar System—many of which are rocky worlds that orbit their stars at distances similar to those of Venus and Earth from the Sun. That means that many of these worlds could be Venus-like. “There is growing realization within the exoplanet community that Venus is the best analogue in the Solar System for many of the rocky exoplanets we have found,” says Laura Schaefer, an astronomer at Stanford University in California who studies exoplanets.\n\nOff the radar\n\nWith such a tantalizing question left unanswered, it’s easy to see why ISRO’s return to Venus has created so much excitement. “I’m thrilled that ISRO is doing this,” Dyar says. “I’m thrilled that the international community is taking note of Venus and proposing missions. That’s fantastic.”\n\nAlthough the ISRO mission is enveloped in a cloud of secrecy (Nature e-mailed and called project scientists dozens of times, to no avail), it’s clear that the agency plans to send an orbiter smothered in instruments. When ISRO announced the mission late last year, it published a list of a dozen instruments proposed by Indian scientists that have already been chosen—providing a sneak peek of the mission. Of those sensors, two will map the planet using radar, which is arguably the best method to peer through Venus’s dense clouds and trace its surface from orbit.\n\nThat said, ISRO is a relatively young space agency with a limited number of successful landings on the Moon and Mars. And, similar to programmes from other fledgling agencies, India’s first Venus mission might be a proof of concept that is less focused on science than on engineering. But given that even basic information on Venus is lacking, any small step will contribute to science.\n\nOne such contribution might be new maps of Venus’s surface features—a major step up, scientifically. The last mission to map the planet’s topography was NASA’s Magellan orbiter, which launched 30 years ago. Although those radar maps remain the foundation of Venusian geoscience today, they show topographic details at a horizontal resolution of just 10–20 kilometres per pixel, on average (the image resolution can be two orders of magnitude higher). With such limited topographic data, researchers have a blurry view of Venus’s geology—but the available maps do hint that plate tectonics might be kicking into action today.\n\nThat is particularly tantalizing, because many scientists think that tectonic activity is a crucial ingredient for life. Tectonic plates—those interlocking slabs of Earth’s crust that fit together like puzzle pieces—constantly move about, with some slipping below others and diving into the planet’s interior in a process called subduction. Over millions of years, that process has kept Earth from growing too hot or cold by cycling heat-trapping carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the deep Earth. It acts as a natural thermostat, which might mean that fidgety planets are more likely to host life.\n\nAs such, scientists are eager to decipher the conditions that allow plate tectonics to arise. That is why Suzanne Smrekar, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, has her eye on Venus—especially some spots that look eerily similar to locations on Earth where subduction is happening now. Scientists agree that subduction is the first step in the path towards plate tectonics, and yet there are no clear signs of large moving plates on Venus—at least not in the decades-old maps produced by Magellan. The San Andreas fault, which forms the tectonic boundary between Earth’s Pacific Plate and North American Plate, for example, varies in width from metres to a kilometre—too narrow to show up in Magellan topographic data.\n\nBut future maps might uncloak such tectonic features. Smrekar is the principal investigator on a potential mission, known as VERITAS, that she and her team will soon propose to NASA. The geophysical mission would use radar to map Venus’s topography in higher resolution than before—increasing the accuracy from roughly 15 kilometres to 250 metres—and allowing scientists to uncover features as small as the San Andreas fault for the first time.\n\nAlthough scientists don’t know what they will find, it is possible that they will uncover evidence for past plate tectonics. Such a discovery would explain why Venus preserved an Earth-like environment for billions of years, Smrekar says—that natural thermostat would have kept CO2 in check. And it would explain how Venus turned hellish. When plate tectonics ceased, CO2 levels would have increased in the atmosphere and trapped so much heat that the oceans vaporized.\n\nBut that is only one possible finding. Some scientists are keen to study the planet’s atmosphere, which holds another, equally tantalizing set of secrets.\n\nThe probe that Garvin is proposing, called DAVINCI, would drop through the atmosphere to measure the brew of toxic compounds. The isotopes of noble gases, particularly xenon, could give scientists a window into the planet’s volcanic history and reveal whether Venus started with as much water as Earth did. “Venus’s atmosphere is this lurking laboratory for telling us about its history,” Garvin says. “And really, most of the measurements in the atmosphere are woefully incomplete.” In addition, the probe would take images of the surface—thanks to Garvin’s terrifying helicopter flights—until the last few seconds before it hits.\n\nBoth VERITAS and DAVINCI will enter NASA’s competition on 1 July for future Discovery missions—a line of low-cost planetary probes that each cost just US$500 million. And rumour has it they’re not alone. There could be as many as five Venus missions (including a balloon) among the dozens of proposals to study various objects in space. NASA’s last Discovery competition, in 2015, for example, considered 27 proposals—from probes that would explore asteroids, moons and planets across the Solar System to telescopes that would image its outer reaches—before choosing two missions that would fly.\n\nAt the end of this year, the administration will select a few missions for further study, and it will pick the final project in two years’ time. Both Smrekar and Garvin are hopeful that each of their missions will be selected, in part because they proposed similar missions in the last Discovery competition, and both were chosen for further study, along with three others. If one of the Venus missions is successful, it will launch in the mid-2020s.\n\nEven after that time frame, Venus might remain a hub for interplanetary activity. ESA recently picked a Venus probe called EnVision, along with two other finalists, as a mission that could fly as soon as 2032. Like VERITAS, EnVision is an orbiter. But unlike VERITAS, which would map the entire planet to a resolution of 15–30 metres, EnVision will analyse small portions of the planet with a resolution as high as 1 metre. At that level of accuracy, scientists might be able to see the landers that the Soviet Union left behind.\n\nThey could even pick out the type of rock that the landers are resting on. This is possible because astronomers in the early 1990s found that certain wavelengths of light can pass through the CO2 haze that hides the Venusian surface. An orbiter carrying a spectrometer tuned to these transparent ‘windows’ in the light spectrum could analyse the composition of the planet’s surface from above the clouds. That’s an exciting prospect, especially if scientists could spot granite.\n\nLike basalt, granite forms when molten magma cools and hardens. But unlike basalt, the recipe for granite typically requires copious amounts of water—which happens on Earth when water-rich oceanic crust subducts below another plate. So if Venus is found to be rich in granite, it probably once overflowed with liquid water.\n\nAnd that might be the best hint yet that the planet was formerly a pale blue dot vastly similar to Earth today—another clue in their diverging stories.\n\nThe problem is that there are only five narrow spectral windows in Venus’s atmosphere that are actually transparent. With such little information, scientists weren’t sure whether they would be able to differentiate between granite and basalt. So Jörn Helbert, a planetary scientist at the Institute of Planetary Research in Berlin, subjected both types of rock to Venus-like conditions and imaged them through those narrow frequency bands. His experiment suggested that the two rock spectra look radically different from one another, and that future missions could make use of the windows. He and his colleagues built an instrument to use this trick to map any granite on the Venusian surface. It would fly on both VERITAS and EnVision.\n\nWithin reach\n\nTo truly understand the surface, a number of scientists want to actually land a craft on our toxic twin—a feat that has not been achieved for 35 years. Although the Soviet Union sent several landers to Venus, the ones that survived quickly succumbed to the planet’s harsh environment: the longest-lasting one persevered for a mere 127 minutes.\n\nBut scientists hope to break that record, and have already designed technology that can last not just minutes, but months. A team at NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, is building a station that should survive for at least 60 days. Instead of using its bulk to absorb heat or countering the conditions with refrigeration, the lander would use simple electronics made of silicon carbide (a hybrid of silicon and carbon commonly used in sandpaper and fake diamonds) that can withstand the Venusian environment. “That’s the real game changer for Venus exploration,” says Philip Neudeck, an electronics engineer at the Glenn Research Center.\n\nThe team has already tested the circuits in a Venus simulation chamber—a 14-tonne stainless-steel tank that can imitate the temperature, pressure and specific chemistry of the Venusian surface. The researchers have used those results to design a stationary surface probe called LLISSE (Long-Lived In-Situ Solar System Explorer), which should be ready for flight by the mid-2020s and will be offered to other countries. “Any mission to Venus is welcome to use LLISSE,” says electronics engineer Gary Hunter, also at the Glenn Research Center. He and the team were careful to design a lander that would be only as large as a toaster—making it both small and light enough that it can hitch a ride on a number of future missions.\n\nDespite its small size, LLISSE would be able to record temperature, pressure, wind speed, wind direction, the amount of solar energy at the surface and a few specific chemicals in the low atmosphere. And it would do so for months, providing crucial input for models of the Venusian atmosphere. “Imagine if one tried to say one knew the weather on Earth by going outside for 127 minutes,” Hunter says. That is the current record for any weather data on Venus.\n\nAlready, scientists at Roscosmos are eager to use this new technology. In a joint proposal with NASA, they are working on a mission known as Venera-Dolgozhivuschaya (where the latter means long-lasting), or Venera-D for short. Such a mission would comprise a menagerie of components—an orbiter, a lander and a long-lived station. The lander would include a number of advanced instruments but would last for only a few hours; the long-lived station would be simpler in design but continue taking measurements for months. The station is likely to be NASA’s LLISSE.\n\nAt least, that’s the baseline architecture—but the mission could include even more. This year, the Venera-D team released a report that covered a number of potential additions, including a balloon that could explore the cloudy atmosphere. And that opens up the possibility of searching for life on Venus. All the other missions proposed so far aim to assess whether Venus was habitable in the past. But a balloon might be able to look for life in the only environment where it might survive today: the skies.\n\n“You can imagine that there’s somewhere in between the hot hostile surface and the cold vacuum of outer space where there are conditions—like Goldilocks’—that are just right for life,” Dyar says. Not only would that layer have a pleasant temperature, but it could also have nutrients, liquid water and energy from the Sun. If life ever existed on the planet, it might have been carried up to the clouds and survived there after the surface turned toxic.\n\nBut even without a balloon, the three main components of the Venera-D mission would provide excellent science, argues Ocampo. “It would be a breakthrough mission in the understanding of Venusian science,” she says. “We haven’t had a mission similar to this before.”\n\nUnfortunately, Venera-D has not yet been selected, and many scientists have expressed some concern over the fact that it has long been discussed and yet still does not have the appropriate funding. But Ludmila Zasova, the lead scientist on the Venera-D mission at the Space Research Institute in Moscow, hopes that might change this year.\n\nIt’s not the only big ambitious mission in the works. Some US teams plan to submit Venus projects to NASA’s New Frontiers programme, which is capped at $1 billion, and to the Flagship mission programme, which costs even more. Because Venus proposals have done well in past competitions (often falling just behind the selected proposals), scientists think there is a good chance that they will now rise to the top.\n\nWith every space agency eyeing our neighbour, Venus is likely to receive a fleet of visitors over the next few decades. And although they all plan to address the question of habitability in one way or another, Garvin is convinced that whatever they find, it will be “beyond our wildest dreams”. Perhaps they will prove that Venus was formerly an ocean world. Or maybe they’ll discover that it’s tectonically active today. “We need to find out,” he says. “Because she’s waiting to tell us something and I would hate to miss the boat.”\n\nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on June 5, 2019.","title":"Venus, Earth’s Evil Twin, Beckons Space Agencies","origin":"Space","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/BB10F71B-933E-4506-AA7E2EF71A62E9D3_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&20A4CDBB-CE37-46C6-AE226EFA35678EF5","link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/venus-earths-evil-twin-beckons-space-agencies/"},{"authors":"Barry Nerhus","pub_date":"June 12, 2019","abstract":"Save the whales. The polar bears. The honeybees. You’ve undoubtedly encountered one or all of these conservation campaigns over the course of your lifetime. You’ll probably encounter many more as our earth’s wildlife continues to hurdle towards mass extinction at an alarming rate. Approximately one eighth of our planet’s plant and animal species are currently at risk. What may seem like a small fraction on its own actually works out to around one million endangered or vulnerable species when extrapolated. That’s no small figure.\n\nSomething must be done! That’s what you're supposed to say after reading a statistic like the one above. Did it spur you to action, or did it merely evoke a feeling of slight disappointment? Perhaps you, like many others, believe that something is already being done. If so, you’re right. Something is already being done—but it’s not enough. Current conservation efforts are no match for the rapid rate of habitat deterioration plaguing our ecosystems. Only partnerships with community-based conservation are capable of inciting the necessary amount of change in the recommended amount of time. \n\nGoverning bodies have done a great job drafting and implementing legislation designed to preserve critical habitats and endangered species. There are at least seven major conservation laws regulating the U.S. alone. Process typically slows progress, however, and there is plenty of red tape between written legislation and actual restoration. Even with policies in place, sometimes we’re too late. Add to that the fact that regulations are only as effective as the individuals that know and follow them, and it’s easy to see how our efforts are minimal in the grand scheme of things. \n\nThere are five major obstacles impeding the progress of most major conservation efforts today: \n\n\n\tLack of enforcement\n\tUnclear goals\n\tUnderfunding\n\tGeneralized strategy\n\tCommunity exclusion, ignorance, or apathy\n\n\nWhile each of these obstacles is significant in its own right, community exclusion is the only one with the potential to minimize the impact of the others when corrected. Including communities in current restoration practices and involving them in future ones instills a certain sense of responsibility and accountability, both of which are crucial to effective habit restoration strategies.\n\nCommunity-based restoration is, essentially, a sustainable conservation program. Rather than relying on present-day law and public opinion to assign importance, it incorporates the value of conservation efforts into the backbone of a community.  When executed correctly, habitat restoration becomes a critical consideration of the legal, academic and economic infrastructures in a given location.  Let’s take a look at what community involvement in each of these areas might look like.\n\nLegal. Federal legislation can only do so much when it comes to environmental conservation and restoration. Overarching policies provide a nice framework, yes, but they fail to consider the nuances and public sentiment of a given location. When legislation becomes local, however, communities are able to provide critical insight that may otherwise be overlooked. Local citizens tend to know more about which area practices might be hindering progress, who is involved in those practices and which alternatives might provide a viable solution. \n\nFurthermore, individuals are far more likely to be aware of the rules policing their own community. It’s difficult for a federal agency to enforce national acts at the municipal level, so it’s of the utmost importance that communities make local enforcement a priority. Some habitats require public assistance in order to be considered fully restored, while others must be left alone entirely. Regulations drafted and enforced at the grassroots level ensures that each diverse habitat in the community receives the proper level of care. \n\nAcademic. One of the most important factors influencing the success of a community-based restoration program is academic involvement. Numerous colleges offer ecology and conservation programs as a part of their curriculum, including the University of California, Irvine, where I teach courses essential to the Masters in Conservation and Restoration Science program; but the important information is limited to the number of students signed up to take such courses. To speed up habitat restoration, it is essential that conservation education moves beyond the walls of higher education and into the syllabi of primary and secondary schools. \n\nYoung people are the future stewards of the earth, so it’s only logical that they understand the current state of their environment as well as the impact of their actions upon it. When educators emphasize the importance of community ecology at an early age, habitat restoration becomes less of a burden and more of an ingrained attitude. \n\nEconomic. Money is often cited as a chief impediment of habitat restoration efforts. Lack of funds translates to lack of action in most cases, but it doesn’t have to. Changing the financial mindset of a community can actually help stimulate conservation economy. Say, for example, that an environment focuses on providing attractive wages and incentives for conservation-related positions within their borders. Not only is such a community encouraging ecologically responsible citizens to become part of its population, but it is putting money into the hands of the individuals that are most likely to do good with it. \n\nUrging local institutions to clearly outline conservation career paths at the educational and professional levels serves a similar purpose. The educational programs attract eco-smart students to the community and the professional pathways offer opportunities for them to stay. The more a community invests in habitat restoration personnel and advocates, the more citizens it acquires who are willing to invest in the community in return. \n\nHabitat restoration is not a fast process, nor will it ever be. We are capable of destroying in minutes what it took nature eons to create. If we’re going to succeed in reversing the damage, if we’re going to truly make a difference, we must move restoration out of the hands of individuals and into the hearts of communities.","title":"Habitat Restoration Isn't Just for Professionals","origin":"Observations","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/1ABC1BDC-C04B-4AAA-803041FC1DF59FD0_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&904E6AEE-6317-45C9-A4BE7F12856EA9EF","link":"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/habitat-restoration-isnt-just-for-professionals/"},{"authors":"Steve Mirsky","pub_date":"June 12, 2019","abstract":"At the third Scientific American “Science Meets Congress” event, “Solving the Plastic Waste Problem”, experts examined the question of biodegradability.","title":"A Biodegradable Label Doesn't Make It So","origin":"Environment 60-Second ScienceSubscribe:Apple iTunesRSS","link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/a-biodegradable-label-doesnt-make-it-so/"},{"authors":"Emily Willingham","pub_date":"June 12, 2019","abstract":"A repeated warning about cannabis use in the post-hippie era is to be aware that what you’re smoking or ingesting isn’t your grandparents’ cannabis. Humans have worked hard in recent decades to produce strains with powerful doses of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive component of the plant. The result is a surprisingly intense high that famously sent New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd into a spiral of paranoia after she ingested a cannabis-laced chocolate edible one fateful evening in Colorado.\n\nA superstrong strain of pot might overpower unwitting baby boomers, but all of this might just be a case of déjà vu. Today’s herb could be somewhat like cannabis that people cultivated about 2,500 years ago in Central Asia, a plant also bearing high levels of THC.  Research published June 12 in Science Advances offers the first evidence that humans around that time not only used cannabis for the high it offers but also selected strains for their THC-packed psychoactive power, burning them in mortuary rituals. The find represents some of the oldest documented use of cannabis for its mind-altering effects. “I am impressed by this new and important discovery,” says Tengwen Long, an assistant professor and environmental archaeologist at the University of Nottingham, Nimbo campus, who was not involved in the study. “It offers us very important data concerning humans’ close interaction with the plant.”\n\nThis earliest example of humans burning cannabis in a purposeful way was uncovered as researchers worked on solving the mystery of ancient wooden burners found at a cemetery site in the Pamir mountain range in eastern China. The burners, dating to about 500 years B.C., were charred. Samples of the char revealed compounds that develop when people living in the region burned cannabis.  Furthermore, the estimated levels of THC in these samples were higher than wild cannabis would normally produce, suggesting intentional cultivation of the plant for its psychoactive powers.\n\nSuch a discovery adds to growing indications of an association among many cultures of cannabis with the afterworld and death, says Mark Merlin, professor of botany at the University of Hawaii, who was not involved in conducting this study. Cannabis was probably used for “medicinal and spiritual reasons,” he says, “which are not really separated by most traditional societies.”\n\nAlthough the work shows the earliest chemical evidence of cannabis smoking, says study author Yimin Yang, professor of archaeometry at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the Pamirs are where the practice first gathered steam. Yang’s co-author Robert Spengler, laboratory director at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, agrees. Despite a cluster of archaeological finds from the Pamirs and other ancient cultures in the mountain foothill areas of Asia, Spengler urges researchers to continue the quest for earlier examples of cannabis use elsewhere.\n\nMore cases may inevitably turn up, says Barney Warf, professor of geography at the University of Kansas, who was not involved in the work. Warf called the most recent finding a “very reasonable and thorough study [that] makes a useful contribution documenting early psychoactive cannabis use. But I would not be surprised if future efforts uncover even earlier cases.” \n\nOther regions where evidence of ancient cannabis use has emerged include the lands of the ancient Scythians in Siberia and similarly old sites in China, where hints of recreational use have been discovered, says study author Hongen Jiang, professor of archaeobotany at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Merlin points to the discovery in Japan of seeds that are about 10,000 years old. “This was a key plant in Eurasia,” he says.\n\nA practice involving cannabis and death rites that may have disseminated far and wide along trade routes such as the Silk Road could have met its end with the rise of monotheism, Merlin says. “The spread of the major monotheistic religions pretty much wiped out shamanism, but there are vestiges,” he notes.\n\nThis sense of an ancient diversity of human ritualistic use lends context to the attention cannabis receives in contemporary headlines, says Spengler. “It is important to continually illustrate that the human interaction with this plant goes deeper back in time,” he says.\n\nIn the meantime, Long sees the findings reported in this study as “unambiguous” in confirming early use of cannabis deliberately as a psychoactive substance. Merlin agrees that all signs point to intentional use of the plant for this purpose, but it’s also possible that ancient people burned it to mask the smell of death and decay associated with mortuary rites, he says.\n\nStill, Merlin doesn’t think that’s really the case, because of the link of cannabis to the burials of shamans, suggesting shamans might continue their practices in the afterlife. Merlin himself has seen a another example of ancient cannabis use, although without confirmation of burning. “It was almost two pounds of cannabis next to a shaman’s head, practically still green,” he says, expressing awe of the find in tombs in Turpan, northwest China. “I observed this 2,500-year-old shaman, and he had mortar that had been caked in cannabis with him. That was a remarkable find.”","title":"Using Marijuana to Get High Dates Back Millennia","origin":"Behavior & Society","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/953837EE-3C36-48FD-B21B73F0E9FB73CA_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&8A98FFAF-972F-41B6-BC73EAC6F009C46A","link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/using-marijuana-to-get-high-dates-back-millennia/"},{"authors":"Kate Marvel","pub_date":"June 12, 2019","abstract":"I left California in the middle of a drought. The hills framing the 280 from the city to Palo Alto turned brown in the summer, as they always did, and then stayed brown through the winter. The pleasant seventy-degree air began to feel oppressive, the glorious blue sky a source of inchoate guilt. I lived in Oakland, by a cemetery on a hill. The winding paths past angel-topped mausolea and modest age-blacked gravestones were framed by a line of sweet gums, peppered with cypress, redwood, and olive. The smell—a peppery sweetness, pine without Christmas—is what I remember when I think of home.\n\nI now live in New York City, where trees are considered suspicious, not allowed to congregate in groups outside the designated parks. The few on my street are framed by small cages to keep the local dogs away. The effect is pathetic, almost comic, a tiny prison for a tall defiant thing. The largest tree I have seen in New York is dead and in the natural history museum. It is an enormous stump of a California sequoia, each ring a record of a life that began twenty generations before the birth of the logger who ended it.\n\nThe trees in New York, and the city too, are fed by moisture carried from the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic. There is no dry season, just a scatter of rain and snow spread evenly on top of the year. California rainfall, though, beats with the erratic rhythm of the tropical Pacific. There, the long spine of South America dredges cold water from the depths of the ocean, upwelling to form a permanent pool of cold water that extends into the west, pushed there by the trade winds. The cold water sloshes back and forth, the winds that drive it pulse to their own beat, and the result of the dance is, in some years, a phenomenon of warmer-than-usual water: the Christ Child, El Niño. When he visits, California can expect a rainy winter. When the opposite conditions prevail—La Niña—it’s drought.\n\nThere are other beautiful places that cycle through drought and floods with some regularity. In the eastern part of Australia, things are reversed. It is El Niño who dries, and La Niña who is associated with the rains. In the Mediterranean, it is a different cycle altogether. It has been like this for thousands of years.\n\nFor as long as we have been able to comprehensively observe the planet, we have been changing it. Satellites have recorded trends since the late 70s. But we have been increasing the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide since well before that. As scientists, we want to attribute the trends we measure to natural cycles like El Niño or externally imposed changes. But it can be difficult to tell if what we are seeing is unusual, because everything we have ever seen is unusual.\n\nTrees have seen more than any of us. If you drill a very small bore into a tree, you can extract a thin rod striped with each year’s rings. If you do this again, to another tree, and then another, and then to thousands all over the world, you can weave them together into a drought atlas, a record of good and bad years, wet and dry soils. Scientists have built these for half the world: North America and Mexico, Europe and the Levant, monsoon Asia and eastern Australia. The map is a record of wet and dry years that stretches backward in time. The trees remember years before world wars and depressions, before industrial and political revolutions, before even the first contact between the invaders and the New World.\n\nThe collected rings of thousands of trees show a pattern of drying and moistening that ebbs and flows with time. El Niño and La Niña arrive with erratic regularity, air and water slosh back and forth, and the trees record the consequences. At the beginning of the twentieth century, though, a faint fixed pattern becomes discernible among the randomness, a quiet but strengthening note against a background symphony. Some regions—California, the Mediterranean, Australia—dry out. It is a small, almost imperceptible-to-humans drying, but it is a pattern that no natural cycle can reproduce.\n\nThis pattern is similar to one that I generate on my computer in a small office in New York. In climate models, one can remove the effects of randomness by re-starting time over and over again, creating a universe of alternate worlds that might have existed but did not. The average of these never-worlds smooths out the kinks and ripples of randomness. If something is left over, it must be something common to all the realities that could have been.\n\nWhat is present in all of these worlds is carbon dioxide, which humans were even then slowly but steadily increasing. Carbon dioxide heats the planet, and warmer air is thirstier air. Even if there are no changes to rainfall, some areas will sink into drought under the atmosphere’s relentless demand for moisture.\n\nAnd this is the pattern that emerges from the trees. It is unusual in the context of everything that has come before, recorded for long posterity in the tree rings. It is a signature of us.\n\nThere are few issues in science that interest me less than the question of when the Anthropocene began. I am not a rock, and I do not need to find proof of human activity in the geological record to be concerned about our impact. But our fingerprints stretch further back into the past than we might have realized. And the harmony between the predictions of my machine-world and the real world recorded in the flesh of tree gives me reason to listen to what those machines tell me for the future.\n\nFrom my office in New York, I can look at these future projections and see California dancing from dry to wet and back again, until there is no again and it settles in to permanent drought. If the trees survive us, they may live to tell of a time where the grass turned brown, the map turned brown, and it was a long time before it was ever green again.","title":"Creeping Toward Permanent Drought","origin":"Hot Planet","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/FFDB502F-729D-4DC3-A06AF2C0F5B7AB2D_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&48E2A878-4E8F-47A1-956305FED6E62E3B","link":"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/hot-planet/creeping-toward-permanent-drought/"},{"authors":"Shannon Hall","pub_date":"June 12, 2019","abstract":"The sea sloshing beneath the icy surface of Jupiter’s moon Europa just might be the best incubator for extraterrestrial life in our solar system. And yet it is concealed by the moon’s frozen outer shell—presenting a challenge for astrobiologists who would love nothing more than to peer inside. Luckily they can catch a partial glimpse by analyzing the flavor of the surface. And the results are salty.  \n\nA new study published this week in Science Advances suggests that sodium chloride—the stuff of table salt—exists on Europa’s surface. Because the exterior is essentially formed from frozen seawater, the finding suggests that Europa’s hidden sea is drenched in table salt—a crucial fact for constraining the possibilities for life on the alien world.\n\nNot that scientists have tasted a slice of the distant moon. To analyze Europa’s composition, astronomers study the light emanating from its surface, splitting it into a rainbow-like spectrum to search for any telltale absorption or emission lines that reveal the world’s chemistry. There is just one problem: Ordinary table salt is white and thus gives off a featureless spectrum. But harsh radiation—which exists at Europa’s surface in abundance—just might add a dash of color. That much was realized in 2015 when two NASA planetary scientists Kevin Hand and Robert Carlson published a study suggesting the yellowish-brown gunk on Europa might be table salt baked by radiation. To reach that conclusion, Hand and Carlson re-created the conditions on Europa within vacuum chambers—or as Hand calls them, “stainless steel shiny objects that are humming and whizzing.” Next, they placed table salt into those chambers, lowered the pressures and temperatures to simulate Europa’s surface, and blasted the samples with an electron gun to simulate the intense radiation.\n\nMany of the electrons were then captured in empty spaces within the salt’s crystalline structure, transforming the salt’s color into a yellowish brown that bore an uncanny resemblance to that of the mysterious material filling the fissures and fractures crisscrossing Europa’s surface. The parallel caused Hand and Carlson to speculate that the gunk just might be irradiated table salt. But a match in color is not proof. Instead, proof could arrive in the form of very distinct spectroscopic features—particularly an absorption line at 450 nanometers within the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. “One of the upshots of this irradiation is that it can help make the previously invisible, visible,” Hand says.\n\nSo, Samantha Trumbo, a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology, her advisor Michael Brown and Hand (now also at Caltech) turned the Hubble Space Telescope toward the distant moon in search of that very feature. And after four observations that ran from May to August 2017, they spotted it. “The match between the lab data and the telescopic data was just beautiful,” Hand says. It proves that the surface of Europa is indeed covered with sodium chloride—at least within a region called Tara Regio that harbors young ice thought to have erupted from the ocean relatively recently. “You’d be able to taste it,” Trumbo says. “If you licked the surface of Europa, at least in this spot, it would taste salty.”\n\nReggie Hudson, an astrochemist at the Cosmic Ice Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center who was not involved in the latest study, is impressed by the full picture. “It’s a very nice synthesis of lab work, Hubble data, radiation chemistry and planetary science,” he says.\n\nFor years, astronomers have argued that another type of salt, magnesium sulfate, was prevalent on Europa’s surface. Under that thinking, the moon’s subsurface ocean might have resembled Epsom salts mixed into a bath. But this new work suggests instead the ocean is more akin to table salt mixed with tap water—like the solution you might create to soothe a sore throat or what you might find in the Earth’s oceans. “It really is a shift from what we’ve thought for the past 20 years or so,” Trumbo says. “If this sodium chloride… is really representative of the ocean composition, then the ocean, at least salt-wise, would be more similar to what we see on Earth.”\n\nAnd that could boost the chance for life to arise and evolve. Even so, scientists cannot yet say what quantities of salt exist beneath the ice. Europa’s seas could ultimately prove to be too salty for life as we know it to exist there at all.\n\nThen again, a more equitable mix of salt and water could allow life there to thrive—especially if that ocean is as active as our own. On Earth, water gets pulled into the seafloor around the flanks of hydrothermal vents—seafloor springs that spew water at superhot temperatures—before being jettisoned back out from the vents themselves. In that process magnesium is captured within the rocks, whereas sodium and chlorine escape. In theory, Europa’s table-salt–laced surface could hint that the moon’s seawater is similarly cycled and even point toward hydrothermal vents—a tantalizing prospect given that these vents on Earth are usually overrun with life. But Hand and Hudson both caution against making such a bold leap. “I’m not 100 percent convinced that sodium chloride on Europa’s surface means hydrothermal activity down under, but the two things are not mutually exclusive,” Hudson says.\n\nAt the very least, the finding shows that Tara Regio is a good spot to study further with NASA’s Europa Clipper mission—a probe set to launch in the 2020s that will orbit Jupiter and fly past Europa 45 times. Trumbo, in particular, would like to search for any organics that might have spilled onto the surface along with the salt. And, just maybe, scientists could get close enough to Europa’s surface to (remotely) taste it, via a robotic lander. “As someone who has studied Europa’s surface chemistry for about 20 years, I’d have to say that nothing beats a lander for getting up close and personal,” Hudson says. And Hand similarly wants to be within reach.\n\n“This is excellent work, but I doubt that it is the last word on the subject,” Hudson says. “As with a lot of good scientific research, it doesn’t close the door, it opens it to future studies.”","title":"Water on Europa—with a Pinch of Salt","origin":"Space","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/F9571C44-9516-46A8-8C9A9B1E78FAF40E_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&8AF1653A-953F-4539-8E44A1632FF29ADA","link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/water-on-europa-with-a-pinch-of-salt/"},{"authors":"Maxine Joselow, E&E News","pub_date":"June 12, 2019","abstract":"An independent panel of experts is poised to scrutinize one of the Trump administration’s most consequential environmental rollbacks.\n\nEPA’s Science Advisory Board voted last week to review the science behind the proposed overhaul of Obama-era clean car standards. The 45-member board, which is tasked with advising EPA on a range of scientific matters, will zero in on the technical analysis underpinning the proposal (E&E News PM, June 6).\n\nCritics of the Trump EPA say the review stands to highlight errors in that analysis that could inform future lawsuits against the administration.\n\n“We anticipate this review will paint a more complete picture ... of the current proposal’s inconsistencies and faulty conclusions,” said Robbie Diamond, president and CEO of Securing America’s Future Energy.\n\nJeff Alson, a former staffer in EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality, said the administration’s analysis “doesn’t pass the laugh test.”\n\n“I think it was clearly based on politics, not science,” he said.\n\nThe rollback, formally known as the “Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule,” is aimed at significantly weakening Obama-era greenhouse gas and fuel economy standards for light-duty vehicles.\n\nPresident Obama made the standards a key plank of his climate agenda. He envisioned getting cars to travel an average of 54.5 mpg by 2025.\n\nBut EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are proposing to freeze fuel economy requirements at an average of 37 mpg.\n\nThe two agencies are also proposing to withdraw California’s Clean Air Act waiver for greenhouse gases, which allows the state to set tougher tailpipe pollution rules than the federal government.\n\nThe scientific board’s review will serve as an important check on the Trump EPA, said Trish Koman, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.\n\n“EPA is a science-based agency, and it has very large public health responsibilities. So the law requires, and the public expects, EPA to obtain independent science advice,” said Koman, who worked as an EPA scientist for 22 years before leaving the agency in 2012.\n\n“The agency, as an institution, really needs to have procedures in place so they can do a rigorous look at the analysis and provide the best information to decisionmakers and the public,” she added.\n\n‘What is going on there?’\n\nThe SAB meeting last week took place in downtown Washington, D.C., and spanned two days.\n\nDuring the first day, the board grappled with how to approach the clean cars rollback and, in particular, the role California plays.\n\nThe proposal sets up a clash with the California Air Resources Board, which has historically issued tougher tailpipe pollution rules than the federal government. Thirteen states have adopted those tougher requirements.\n\nAn SAB work group chaired by Alison Cullen, a public health expert at the University of Washington, recommended that the full board review the proposal only if EPA and CARB fail to reach agreement on “harmonized” tailpipe standards applying to the entire country.\n\n“If they don’t harmonize the rule between CARB and EPA, then I think it would be interesting for SAB to consider what are the differences,” Cullen said. “Why are they not able to harmonize? And [are] aspects of the science being differently emphasized? What is going on there?”\n\nThe board also confronted the rollback’s effect on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.\n\nAn analysis by the Rhodium Group, an economic consulting firm, found that the proposal would lead to an additional 32 million to 114 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nBut John Christy, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Alabama, Huntsville, argued that the proposal would not affect emissions at all. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler appointed Christy, who rejects mainstream climate science, to the board in January (E&E News PM, Jan. 31).\n\nThe rollback “will have zero effect on the climate,” Christy said at the meeting. “So this is going to be a policy issue. There’s no science in terms of its impact on the climate.”\n\nSAB Chairman Michael Honeycutt proposed that the board defer action on the rollback until its next meeting. But that remark prompted grumbles of opposition from several members. The board then agreed by a show of hands to conduct the review.\n\n‘Foot-dragging’\n\nThe SAB faces a severely compressed time window for its review. The Trump administration is seeking to finalize the rollback this month, although experts have questioned whether it can meet this self-imposed deadline (Climatewire, June 3).\n\n“If the administration is going to proceed on the time frame it mentioned, it’s going to be very hard for the SAB to do an analysis of the scope and complexity that’s needed,” said Chris Frey, a professor of environmental engineering at North Carolina State University.\n\nFrey, who served on the SAB from 2012 to 2018, accused Wheeler of using delay tactics to foster the time crunch. The board sent EPA a notice of its intent to review the rollback last June; Wheeler responded 10 months later.\n\n“It shouldn’t take 10 months for the administrator to respond,” Frey said. “In my opinion, the administrator is foot-dragging to let the clock run out and hope the SAB doesn’t get its act together to do anything.”\n\nEPA spokesman Michael Abboud pushed back.\n\n“In his first few months on the job, Administrator Wheeler has strived to engage with the SAB on a more regular basis, which is why he provided his April letter to the board and appeared before the Board last week to take questions,” Abboud said in an email to E&E News.\n\n“Administrator Wheeler will continue to work with the SAB and try to improve relations that the previous administration took for granted,” he said.\n\nLawsuits on the horizon\n\nStill, the board’s review could ultimately provide ammunition for future lawsuits.\n\n“It would be informative to future rulemaking efforts to have an SAB opinion on record. And it may also be informative to litigants,” Frey said.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D), a vocal foe of President Trump, has promised to sue once the rollback is finalized. So have a litany of environmental groups.\n\n“We all know that there will be immediate litigation as soon as the rollback is completed,” said Alson, the former EPA staffer. “If the Science Advisory Board were to go on record with concerns about how the science and technical analysis were carried out, I would think that would be exactly the type of information judges would be interested in.”\n\nThe SAB could help California and green groups pinpoint specific errors in the administration’s technical analysis, Alson said.\n\nIn particular, the administration has argued that the rollback will prevent 12,700 deaths on the nation’s roads. To justify this claim, it pointed to something called the “scrappage model,” which predicts when people will “scrap” an older car and purchase a newer model.\n\nBut critics say the administration manipulated the scrappage model to get its desired result.\n\n“The analysis underlying your proposal simply makes no sense,” CARB Chairwoman Mary Nichols testified at a hearing in Fresno, Calif., last year, adding, “[These] claims are not only absurd on their face; they are not supportable by fact.”\n\nA group of 11 prominent researchers published a paper in Science magazine last year accusing the administration of misrepresenting their findings in its technical analysis. They say the administration not only manipulated their work on the scrappage model but also on fleet size, compliance costs and other factors (Climatewire, Dec. 7, 2018).\n\n“There were just so many assumptions made in that analysis that are not defensible,” Alson said. “The paper in Science magazine was just one example.”\n\nReporter Sean Reilly contributed.\n\nReprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&E News.
