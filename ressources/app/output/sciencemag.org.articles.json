        "abstract": "By Alex FoxMay. 3, 2019 , 1:20 PM, Researchers may have an antidote for the deadliest jellyfish sting on Earth, The sting of a box jellyfish can kill a person in minutes. Scientists have long sought to figure out the secret of its fast-acting venom, which also causes agony, inflammation, and heart attacks. A new study may have the answer—and a potential antidote., Meet the blue crew, scientists trying to give food, flowers, and more a color rarely found in nature, The quest for blue pigments—whose complex chemistry makes them rare in nature and difficult to synthesize—dates back millennia. Most were discovered by accident or are merely synthetic versions of blues already found in nature. In 2009, a chemist stumbled on the first new inorganic blue pigment in 200 years. Today, other researchers are continuing that quest by methodically using physics, chemistry, and genetics to create new blues to dazzle us with., Imported wolves settle in as Lake Superior island teems with moose, Thirteen new radio-collared wolves are now scouting Isle Royale in Michigan and feasting on moose, whose numbers this winter reached 2060—the second highest estimate since ecologists began to study predators and prey on the island in 1958. The new wolves, imported to help restore the U.S. national park from overbrowsing by moose, are largely avoiding the territory of the remaining two wolves of the original Isle Royale population. Twenty female moose are also sporting radio collars, allowing biologists to watch both wolf and moose movements online., This shrimplike creature makes aluminum armor to survive the deep sea’s crushing pressure, Amphipods—small, shrimplike crustaceans in most aquatic ecosystems—start to fall apart once they hit depths of 4500 meters. There, a combination of crushing pressures, low temperature, and higher acidity causes the calcium carbonate in their exoskeletons to dissolve, making them vulnerable to pressure and predators. Now, scientists have discovered how one species, Hirondellea gigas, can survive in the deepest part of the ocean: with aluminum suits of armor., Neanderthals may have trapped golden eagles 130,000 years ago, The golden eagle has been hunted and revered by human cultures for thousands of years. Yet this may not have been a uniquely human devotion—Neanderthals, too, may have targeted these impressive birds of prey some 130,000 years ago, according to new research. What’s more, modern humans may have learned their eagle-catching techniques from their hominin cousins.",

        "abstract": "German research minister Anja Karliczek helped negotiate a budget deal with steady rises for science., By Gretchen VogelMay. 3, 2019 , 12:20 PM, BERLIN—German research organizations cheered a decision announced today by state and federal ministers to increase research budgets by 3% a year for the next decade—a total boost of €17 billion over that time. For more than a decade, German research organizations have enjoyed consistent budget increases—3% boosts every year since 2006, even during downturns in the German economy. But some observers have worried that falling tax revenues and deep disagreements between state and federal ministers could bring an end to the largesse., The news turned out much better than most expected. Not only will the research organizations—including the Max Planck Society and the grantmaking agency the German Research Foundation—get their increases, universities and technical schools will also receive significant boosts through 2027. “It’s a huge relief,” says Matthias Kleiner, president of the country’s Leibniz Association here, which includes more than 90 research institutes. The agreement is “an extraordinarily positive and encouraging signal for science.”, The deal also approves two new Max Planck institutes: the Institute for Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection, to be based in Bochum, and a new independent Institute for the Biology of Behavior in Radolfzell, previously part of the Institute for Ornithology. The Leibniz Association will also add two institutes: The German Resilience Center in Mainz will study factors that keep people healthy even under stressful conditions and the Center for Sustainable Architecture for Finance in Europe in Frankfurt will study the effects of political decisions on finance markets., Negotiations centered on who—the federal or state government—should shoulder the increases. Since 2014, the federal government has covered the budget increases, skewing traditional cost-sharing formulas between the federal and state governments. The funding of Max Planck institutes traditionally is split 50-50 between the state and federal government, for example, whereas Leibnitz institutes are funded 90% by states., The federal government’s insistence that the states return to covering their full share was a threat to the 3% yearly boosts. Instead, the ministers agreed to keep the budgets growing and to spread out the rebalancing process over a 10-year agreement instead of the usual 5 years. The federal government will cover most of the increases through 2023, and the states will increase their share from 2024 through 2030., In return, the research organizations will undergo more yearly evaluations—and a full evaluation in 5 years. That doesn’t mean the increases are in jeopardy, Federal Minister of Education and Research Anja Karliczek said here at a press conference. “It will be a chance to make sure the organizations are on track to meet the goals they set—and refocus if necessary,” she says. Kleiner welcomes the evaluations. “We have to accept that we can show we are using the money wisely.”, In recent weeks Karliczek has been the target of criticism, with commentators predicting she would be one of the first ministers to go if Chancellor Angela Merkel reshuffles her cabinet, as is expected following European elections in late May. But the agreement could silence some of those critics. “It’s a brilliant coup” for the minister, Kleiner says., Merkel and state leaders are expected to give final approval to the plan on 6 June.",

        "abstract": "By David AdamMay. 3, 2019 , 8:00 AM, An attempt to make Yosemite National Park’s famed 2700-meter-high Half Dome rock formation safer for hikers appears to have backfired., In 2010, the California park began to issue permits through a random lottery to visitors interested in scaling Half Dome (pictured). It cited overcrowding for its decision; in the decade before, seven people died on the formation, including several who slipped and fell. Media attention focused on the way hikers had to queue and bunch together as they used metal handrails that are drilled into the rock to help people up the final, steepest section. The park hoped the permitting would limit the number of climbers crowded together on the rails at the top, and thus improve safety., But the permitting appears to have made matters worse, according to a study in press at Wilderness & Environmental Medicine. When researchers analyzed search-and-rescue data on and around Half Dome from 2005 to 2015, they found no significant difference in deaths and injuries after Yosemite began to issue permits. But because the permitting halved the number of visitors who hike the trail, the number of serious incidents per person effectively doubled., The permits may encourage visitors to take risks, including to keep going if they feel unwell, as they know they might not get another permit—and thus another chance to reach the top, the team speculates. Or the widespread publicity of the permitting process may attract people who are unfit or inexperienced.",

        "abstract": "A boy with X-linked myotubular myopathy. Gene therapy is helping some patients breathe without a ventilator., By Jocelyn KaiserMay. 2, 2019 , 5:20 PM, WASHINGTON, D.C.—A new gene therapy treatment has had striking results in nine boys born with myotubular myopathy (MTM), a rare disease that causes extreme muscle weakness often from birth. All of the boys have better neuromuscular function, most can sit on their own, and four are now breathing without ventilators. As videos of their improvements were shown here on 1 May at the annual meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT), the audience broke out in applause. The results, the first of their kind for this rare disease, cap a year of early signs of success in using gene therapy for inherited muscle diseases., As far as muscle function is concerned, the boys “have gone from nothing to something,” says principal investigator Perry Shieh, a neurologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Time will tell how much that something will be.”, The patients in the new study have X-linked MTM, caused by a defect in a gene called MTM1 that encodes an enzyme, myotubularin. Skeletal muscles need the enzyme to develop and function. Boys with the disease have low muscle tone and, in many cases, can barely breathe or move on their own; most require a ventilator and feeding tube. Half of patients die by 18 months, and few live past age 10., In the trial, sponsored by Audentes Therapeutics, a gene therapy company in San Francisco, California, nine boys between 8 months and 6 years old with X-linked MTM received an intravenous (IV) infusion of many trillions of particles of a harmless virus, called an adeno-associated virus. The viruses were designed to carry a good copy of the MTM1 gene into the boys’ muscle cells. The gene, a free-floating piece of DNA, could then trigger the cell’s proteinmaking machinery to produce myotubularin. Three patients had serious side effects that may have been related to the therapy, such as heart inflammation, but all were treatable., Biopsies showed that 48 weeks after the first six boys received treatment, their leg muscle cells that previously had virtually no myotubularin were making, on average, 85% of the normal amount, Shieh reported yesterday. The boys’ abnormally small muscle fibers had grown larger. Four can now sit up without help, and three are taking steps with assistance; although still receiving nutrition through a feeding tube, several have started to eat food. And some can vocalize sounds for the first time, Shieh says., In one set of before-and-after videos, a 1-year-old boy lay passively on an examining table; 48 weeks after his treatment, he could stand and take steps with help. In another, a child who wobbled and needed help to sit up later sat alone and reached out to grab a toy. Three children treated with a higher dose are showing similar motor function gains after 6 months, along with faster changes in their muscle cells and up to double the amount of myotubularin that a healthy child’s cells make, Shieh reported., “They’re getting great results,” says gene therapy researcher and ASGCT president Michele Calos of Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who chaired a symposium of the meeting’s top abstracts, where Shieh presented. And in theory, those results could last: Because muscle cells don’t normally divide, the extra myotubularin could keep the boys’ muscles working for years to come. Dogs with a milder form of MTM that received the same therapy and gained the ability to run are still doing fine years later, Shieh notes., The treatment will be tested in more children before Audentes seeks approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Meanwhile, another IV gene therapy, for a rare genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy that led to dramatic improvements in 15 children is expected to soon become the second FDA-approved gene therapy for an inherited disorder. (The first was gene therapy for an inherited form of blindness in late 2017.), In the past year, experimental IV gene therapy from the biotech company Sarepta Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has also helped four boys born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy gain muscle strength—they can now more easily climb stairs, for example. And 60 days after a similar treatment, patients with a disease called limb-girdle muscular dystrophy are making substantial amounts of a missing muscle protein, Sarepta recently reported. To see such treatments finally helping patients is “surreal,” says Louise Rodino-Klapac, who spent her career developing these therapies in the lab at Ohio State University and Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus before joining Sarepta last year to head its gene therapy unit., These and other successes have helped spur an explosion of interest in the field. The ASGCT meeting, which for years attracted about 2000 attendees, drew more than 4800 this year, forcing the hotel hosting the meeting to turn people away from packed rooms and set up tents for some sessions. Many of the new attendees were from biotech companies. That’s a signal, says Calos, that after overcoming early obstacles, gene therapy is now “maturing as a branch of medicine.” From now on, she adds, the meeting will take place at larger venues.",

        "abstract": "A lawsuit targets a global health institute and the dean of the Icahn School of Medicine in New York City, which is part of the Mount Sinai Health System., By Meredith WadmanMay. 2, 2019 , 3:05 PM, Seven current and former female employees have sued officials at a global health institute that is part of the Mount Sinai Health System’s Icahn School of Medicine in New York City, claiming age and sex discrimination. They claim the medical school’s dean, Dennis Charney, hired an underqualified man to direct the center, and allege that the director then drove out women who were in their 40s and older and preferentially hired younger men. An eighth plaintiff on the lawsuit, a man, claims discrimination based on race, religion, and national origin., The 174-page lawsuit, filed on 26 April, names as defendants Charney and three men at the Arnhold Institute for Global Health (AIGH), which designs technology and systems to improve the health of poor communities. It makes a number of allegations against center Director Prabhjot Singh, who was hired in 2015, including that he disparaged, demoted, and marginalized female employees; lied to funders about the status of a software project; and did not seek required ethics reviews for some research projects., The plaintiffs also allege that Singh countenanced abuse of female employees by David Berman, who was Singh’s chief of staff at the time, and Bruno Silva, the institute’s director of design and product development. Silva, the lawsuit alleges, called female co-workers and donors “bitches” and “c---s,” and that Singh “did nothing to curb him.” Berman “was known for violent screaming at women … which Singh nonchalantly ignored,” the lawsuit alleges., Berman, who could not be reached for comment, left the institute last summer. The Icahn School of Medicine declined to make Charney, and the two other defendants who still work at AIGH, available for interviews. The medical school said it does not comment on pending litigation but stated that: “We deny the allegations of discrimination … [and] expect to vigorously defend the action.” It also noted that, “Consistent with the School of Medicine’s longstanding commitment to equity and inclusion, when employees in the Institute for Global Health brought concerns to our attention last year, we promptly initiated an internal review after which appropriate steps were taken.”, The lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that the internal review, which was prompted by a complaint from some of the plaintiffs and other employees, was insufficient, as were the resulting actions. And it paints an unflattering picture of Charney, a prominent neurobiologist and psychiatrist. It depicts him driving away a senior woman who had been chosen by a search committee to lead AIGH, and instead hiring Singh, who was 32 years old at the time., Singh has a medical degree from Cornell University and a doctorate in neural and genetic systems from Rockefeller University in New York City. He was a visiting assistant professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University from 2011 to 2015 and was a staff associate and then a postdoctoral scientist at Columbia’s Earth Institute from 2007 to 2011., The lawsuit alleges that Singh wanted to remake AIGH into a Silicon Valley–like startup with a “bro culture” dominated by young men. “Dr. Singh directly [hired] largely younger, male friends and contacts, despite their lack of experience in global health,” states a press release issued by McAllister Olivarius, a law firm in Saratoga Springs, New York, that is representing the plaintiffs. “He disbanded the Institute’s Advisory Board, an important source of fundraising, because he considered its members ‘ladies who lunch.’”, The plaintiffs include Holly Atkinson, 66, a physician and former medical journalist who built and directed the human rights program at AIGH. The lawsuit states that in 2015, Singh demoted Atkinson from her director position, began to assign her tasks such as maintaining a Mailchimp list, and told her she would have to take a pay cut of $60,000 if she wanted to remain on staff. Atkinson left the institute in 2016., Another plaintiff, Natasha Anushri Anandaraja, 44, is a pediatrician and tropical medicine expert who directed global health education at AIGH. Singh “regularly denigrated Anandaraja’s work with harsh and cutting critiques,” the lawsuit alleges. “[H]e was careful not to leave a paper trail demonstrating his frequent cruelty.” Anandaraja left the center in 2016. (She has since returned to Mount Sinai part time in another capacity and does not report to Singh.), The male plaintiff, Humale Khan, is a computer scientist who left the institute in February. He and other plaintiffs allege that Singh misled funding groups about a software project supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development in Washington, D.C. Singh, the lawsuit alleges, told funders the project was advancing and had hundreds of users, when it was in fact “vaporware … a vague collection of specifications and unfinished code.” The lawsuit also alleges that Singh violated a law meant to protect patient data and failed to get required ethics committee approvals for some projects involving human subjects., AIGH had been called Mount Sinai Global Health. But after a $12.5 million, 2013 donation from the Arnholds, a prominent New York banking family, it was renamed in their honor., Update May 4, 2019: This article was updated to correct Prabjhot Singh's previous positions at Columbia University, ",

        "abstract": "Math may have caught up with the swirling mergers of black holes like the one in this simulation., By Adrian ChoMay. 2, 2019 , 3:10 PM, Just a month into a renewed observing campaign with a trio of detectors, physicists today announced they have spotted more gravitational waves—fleeting ripples in space set off when two massive objects such as black holes spiral into each other. The collaboration has now bagged 13 merging black hole pairs, as well as two pairs of neutron stars. But even as detections accumulate, one theorist has made an advance that could change how the team analyzes the signals and make it easier to test Albert Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity., To interpret their signals gravitational wave hunters compare them to computer simulations. Now, Sean McWilliams, a theoretical astrophysicist at West Virginia University in Morgantown, has calculated an exact mathematical formula for the signal, or waveform, produced by two merging black holes., “It’s a big step forward,” says Neil Cornish, a gravitational wave astronomer at Montana State University in Bozeman who was not involved in the work. “It’s going to allow for more accurate waveforms for doing analysis. But it also gives us more insight into what’s going on” in a black hole merger., In 1916, Einstein predicted that as two stars orbit each other they’d radiate gravitational waves, although he figured the waves would be too feeble to detect. In 2015, physicists with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) spotted a burst of waves from two black holes that merged 1.3 billion light-years away, using their huge optical instruments in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana. The Virgo detector near Pisa, Italy, joined the hunt in August 2017, enabling the collaboration to triangulate to the sources of the events on the sky., As two black holes spiral ever closer, they emit ripples in space that speed up. The waves’ intensity peaks as the two objects collide, and then peter out as the final, merged black hole undulates and settles down. To decipher the signal and determine the black holes’ masses and other parameters, scientists compare it to a catalog of simulated signals, a tack they have taken because of the complexity of the problem., According to general relativity, gravity arises when mass and energy warp spacetime. And a black hole is the ultraintense gravitational field left behind when a massive star collapses to an infinitesimal point. So when two black holes swirl together, warping begets warping and renders the mathematics “nonlinear” and intractable., Or so many scientists assumed. McWilliams says he has found a way to calculate the signal mathematically after all, as he reports in a paper in press at Physical Review Letters., Two relatively simple formulas describe the peak and reverberation of gravitational wave signals like the first ones the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory saw., The calculation involves special distances from the center of the black hole. Famously, nothing can escape a black hole if it draws closer than a characteristic distance called the event horizon. At a distance about 1.5 times that of the event horizon, the black hole’s gravity will bend passing light into a circular orbit, defining the “light ring.” A distance roughly three times that of the event horizon marks the limit for a massive object to maintain a circular orbit and not spiral in, a threshold called the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)., Previous attempts to calculate the exact waveform from a black hole merger relied on a standard mathematical transformation, turning the problem of two orbiting black holes into one of a single body spiraling in a funnel-shaped energy landscape. But within the ISCO, the body stops spiraling, forcing researchers to correct its path with numerical simulations. McWilliams realized he could avoid that problem by skipping to the final merged black hole. He then used general relativity to calculate how a tiny test mass spirals into and perturbs the final black hole, enabling him to calculate the radiated signal from the ISCO inward., Once the test particle reaches the light ring, tracing its trajectory becomes mathematically untenable. But McWilliams says the physics there can be ignored for a simple reason: All the churning of spacetime within the light ring cannot escape to influence the spreading gravitational waves. Essentially, the black hole itself slurps up all the nasty nonlinearities. McWilliams provides a pair of formulas that neatly match the simulations. “I’ll be honest,” he says, “I was rather floored how well it agrees with the results of numerical relativity.”, Those formulas could prove valuable in tests of general relativity, McWilliams says, especially as black holes are objects made of pure gravitational energy, with no messy matter to get in the way. LIGO’s and Virgo’s observations have already confirmed general relativity’s accuracy to an unprecedented level, but researchers should be able to push further as they hone their instruments’ sensitivity. They’ll need more precise predictions of the waveforms from general relativity, McWilliams says, and the exact formulas should be more accurate than the numerical simulations., Lionel London, a gravitational wave theorist and LIGO team member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, isn’t so sure. McWilliams still has to rely on simulations to model the spiraling outside the ISCO, he notes, and that part of the signal is key to determining the masses of the initial black holes. The calculations also depend on certain simplifying assumptions, but do not provide estimates of the uncertainties carried with them, he says. The formulas are more of an “ansatz”—an educated guess at how the signal should look—than an exact solution to the problem, London says., Cornish agrees it’s too early to replace numerical relativity. Still, he says, the formulas will be useful and should spur physicists to explain why black hole mergers seem to be simpler than they had anticipated. “There’s more to be learned.”, In the meantime, LIGO and Virgo researchers will have no shortage of signals. During the first month of their third observing run, they have detected five new candidate events, including three black hole mergers, a second neutron star merger, and a possible black hole-neutron star merger spotted last week. The mixed merger would be another gem for scientists, as they lack even good estimates of how often such things should occur. “Because it’s such an interesting astrophysical object, it’s generating a lot of excitement, which I think it deserves,” says Jessica McIver, a physicist and LIGO team member from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena., Still, the tantalizing signal is relatively weak. Researchers estimate that random noise should produce a similar spurious signal about once every 20 months, and there’s a 14% chance that it originated in terrestrial vibrations. “If you ask me, ‘Would you bet a coffee, your car, or your house on this?’ I would say, ‘I’d bet your car,’” says Salvatore Vitale, a physicist and LIGO member from MIT. To nail the case for the supposed mixed merger, astronomers would likely have to spot light and electromagnetic waves from it.",

        "abstract": "The National Institutes of Health’s in-house research program plans to limit the terms of midlevel managers, in part so that more women can move into leadership positions., By Jocelyn KaiserMay. 2, 2019 , 2:55 PM, Able to pursue open-ended research without relentless grant deadlines, some scientists who work directly for the National Institutes of Health joke that NIH stands for \"nerds in heaven.\" But the main NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland, and its other intramural research sites are also known as stodgy places where the scientific management, mostly white men, tends to stay in place for decades. Now, NIH is aiming to shake up its intramural program, the largest collection of biomedical researchers in the world, by imposing term limits on midlevel leadership positions., Starting next year, the 272 lab and branch chiefs who oversee NIH's intramural research will be limited to 12-year terms. The policy, now being refined by the directors of NIH's 23 institutes with in-house science programs, means up to half of the chiefs will turn over in the next 5 years, says Michael Gottesman, NIH's deputy director for intramural research. \"We see this as an opportunity for diversity in the leadership at NIH, especially gender and ethnic diversity,\" says Hannah Valantine, NIH's chief officer for scientific workforce diversity., The changes are roiling the campus, with some grumbling they will have little impact and others questioning whether good leaders should automatically be replaced. \"The appointment of more women … could be a plus, but the ‘coin of the realm’ still remains scientific excellence and productivity,\" says Malcolm Martin, who has headed a lab at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for 37 years., At most institutes, NIH's intramural lab and branch chiefs oversee several labs or groups. Although they don't control researchers' budgets directly, they handle administrative matters, mentoring, and recruitment. Chiefs overseeing clinical studies and shared facilities hold even more sway. \"These are fiefdoms where [chiefs have] power and resources,\" Valantine says., Many chiefs (54 of 272) have served at least 20 years, and 17 for more than 30 years, Gottesman says. Although 26% are women—comparable to the 24% women among all NIH tenured researchers—men tend to lead larger programs. Because of the lack of turnover, \"People feel like there's no way they'll ever have a leadership position,\" says Gisela Storz, chair of NIH's equity committee, which pushed for the changes. \"And trainees need to see people in those positions who look like them.\", Under the draft policy released in January, the chiefs will have to step down after at most three 4-year terms. The positions that become vacant will be filled through \"open and transparent processes,\" the draft policy states. While some institutes already do that, at others, the scientific director overseeing the intramural program \"plucks an heir apparent\" from internal staff, Storz says., To help build the pipeline, NIH will rely on a recently launched program aimed at recruiting more tenure-track female and minority faculty. In the long term, NIH hopes its intramural leadership will more closely reflect that women now earn more than 50% of new Ph.D. degrees in the biological sciences, Valantine says., Individual institutes are now figuring out how to enact the term limits \"in a way that's not disruptive,\" Gottesman says. Some chiefs may be exempt, he says, if a change would have \"serious consequences\" for science programs, for example because there is no pool of candidates for the job., One former NIH veteran is skeptical. \"How much have they thought this through?\" asks Story Landis, who was scientific director and later director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. She questions why NIH would want to replace a midcareer chief doing a stellar job. And, she wonders, will the job searches truly be open? Will women get the training they need to move into leadership positions?, Others point out that NIH's scientific directors—seven of whom are now women—are the true feudal lords, and the new policy does not affect them. Gottesman has held his job for 25 years., But he and the scientific directors he oversees may be next: NIH term limits could \"move up to other kinds of leadership,\" Valantine says.",

        "abstract": "Modern Mongolian herders depend on horses much the way their ancestors did., By Elizabeth PennisiMay. 2, 2019 , 11:35 AM, When Ludovic Orlando made up his mind to uncover the origins of domestic horses, he didn’t horse around. With 120 other researchers, the molecular archaeologist from France’s CNRS research agency in Toulouse combed stables and dig sites from across Europe and Asia to amass the world’s largest collection of horse DNA—some of it as old as 42,000 years. Now, after several years of intensive analysis, he still doesn’t know when and where modern horses got their start. But he and his colleagues have a much clearer understanding of how humans shaped equine evolution, and they’ve uncovered two previously unknown lineages of horses., “This is something of an ancient genomics tour de force,” says Daniel Bradley, an evolutionary geneticist at Trinity College Dublin who wasn’t involved in the work. “The scale of sampling makes these data an important and durable legacy.”, To find out where and when humans first began to domesticate horses, Orlando’s team first looked to Kazakhstan, where excavations of ancient Botai settlements had suggested these herders were among the earliest to harness horses. But the DNA evidence suggested these animals were not the modern horse's ancestors, as Botai horses were on a different branch of the horse family tree than modern horses, they reported last year in Science., The researchers then reached out to field archaeologists, geneticists, and museum curators and obtained extensive DNA data from 278 ancient horses and their relatives from throughout Eurasia. They compared those genomes to the genomes of 30 modern horses and reconstructed 5000 years of equine history. First, they assessed which ancient DNA samples were similar enough to modern horse DNA that they could have been the wild horse ancestor. No ancient samples made that cut., That doesn’t surprise Greger Larson, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom who was not involved in the study. “Domestication is complex, and the only way to even begin to understand it is by comprehensively assessing lots of samples … from a wide range of contexts and cultures,” he says. Even though the team did its best, he still thinks there must be as-yet-undiscovered cultures that had the first modern horses., But even though the new work does not show where domesticated horses came from, it does reveal the existence of two new horse lineages: an ancient equine that roamed what is now Portugal and Spain some 4000 years ago, and another that lived in Siberia in Russia around the same time. Since then, both lineages have gone extinct, and there are no traces of them left in modern horse DNA, the team reports today in Cell. Those results could tank an earlier theory suggesting domesticated horses arose in the Iberian Peninsula, Orlando says., The study also reveals that a lot of the attributes of modern horses appeared much more recently. For example, there are “major genetic turnovers,” Orlando says, after the Arabs expanded into Europe in the seventh century. At that time, Arabian stallions outproduced males from other breeds, leading to their Y chromosome being present in all modern horses today. “It was really cool to see when that loss of male diversity happened,” says Molly McCue, a geneticist at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul who was not involved in the study., The genome data also reveal that selective breeding greatly intensified about 200 years ago—with positive and negative consequences. Genetic diversity in horses severely declined, allowing more potentially deleterious mutations to accumulate and lead to a higher risk of genetic disease. But that intense breeding also led to faster, stronger horses with greater staying power. The work “really illustrates that horses some 1000 years ago and horses now are two different creatures,” Orlando says., The new research “is significantly filling in the gaps in our knowledge and fleshing out the background information at a remarkable pace,” says Sandra Olsen, a zooarchaeologist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. She thinks there may be many more undiscovered lineages of horses just waiting to be found, and that the wild ancestor of modern horses might hail from Ukraine, western Russia, or Hungary. And although no one really knows, Larson is optimistic: “I’m sure they’ll find it,” he says. “It’s got to be out there somewhere.”",

        "abstract": "A new injectable gel could help repair damaged soft tissues., By Robert F. ServiceMay. 1, 2019 , 4:30 PM, Car crashes, battle wounds, and surgeries can leave people with gaping holes in soft tissue that are often too large for their bodies to repair. Now, researchers have developed a nanofiber-reinforced injectable gel that can rebuild missing muscle and connective tissues by serving as a scaffold and recruiting the body’s wound-healing cells. So far, the team has tested the material only in rats and rabbits. But if it performs as well in humans, it could give reconstructive surgeons a fast and easy way to help patients regenerate lost tissues without scarring or deformity., “Soft tissue losses are a ubiquitous problem in clinical medicine,” says Sashank Reddy, a reconstructive surgeon at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. Surgeons can transplant tissue from another body region to the injury site. But that involves trauma for patients and tissue loss from another part of the body. Surgeons can also insert synthetic implants. But immune cells typically just wall off those implants, leaving behind thick, fibrous scars., Then there are gellike fillers. When injuries are small—on the order of fingertip-size—surgeons often inject a gel made from hyaluronic acid (HA) that immune cells called macrophages can infiltrate. As they burrow inside and encounter HA molecules, macrophages typically send out signals that recruit blood vessel–forming cells and other cells that help repair the damage. But with larger gaps in tissue, HA gels are typically too squishy to hold their shape. Researchers have tried to fortify gels by linking gel molecules. But to make gels strong and tough enough to behave like tissue, researchers must add so many links that they create a stiff 3D mesh. But its pores are too small for macrophages and other cells to penetrate. “It changes the biology,” says Jennifer Elisseeff, a biomedical engineer at Johns Hopkins who was not part of Reddy’s team. As a result, the macrophages release signals that lead to scar tissue., Now, Reddy and his colleagues have come up with a better way to reinforce HA gels. They first created nanofibers out of a biodegradable polymer used for decades in dissolvable sutures, called polycaprolactone. They then treated the fibers so that some would contain molecular linkers designed to bind to HA. An hourslong process formed bonds between the molecular linkers and the HA molecules, creating a gel that was as resilient as soft tissue. And, much as a bit of rebar reinforces concrete, the gel needed only a small volume of nanofibers to become rigid. That small amount meant the gel still had gaps large enough for cells to easily pass through. The resulting 3D mesh, says Reddy, has a striking resemblance to the body’s extracellular matrix, the natural scaffolding for healthy tissues., To test their material, Reddy and his colleagues injected it into rabbits in which some fat had been surgically excised, before the material stiffened. Not only did the gel take the shape of the missing tissue as it firmed up, but after it did, macrophages readily infiltrated it and released signals that recruited blood vessel–forming cells, among others. The animals were able to rebuild chunks of tissue as large as 10 cubic centimeters, about the size of a human finger, researchers report today in Science Translational Medicine., The new gel is “cutting edge, scientifically,” says Ali Khademhosseini, a bioengineer at the University of California, Los Angeles, who wasn’t involved in the research. He notes that, unlike other gels, this one does not include growth factors and other biological signaling molecules, instead relying on the body to supply its own. That simplicity could make it easier for the gel to pass muster with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Khademhosseini says., The gel could also help repair soft tissues with specific functions, like heart muscle cells. Hai-Quan Mao, a biomaterials expert and member of the team from Johns Hopkins, says the researchers hope to seed the matrix with stem cells that form cardiac tissue, in order to help repair tissue damage after a heart attack. That’s still in the research phase; in the meantime, the researchers have already formed a company to commercialize the technology, called LifeSprout.",

        "abstract": "Earth-observing instruments roost on a platform attached to a Japanese module., By Paul VoosenMay. 2, 2019 , 12:05 PM, The International Space Station (ISS) has never been known as a hotbed of science, even though the United States and partner nations spent more than $100 billion to build it. Inside its cramped bays, astronauts study the biological effects of microgravity, and a few astrophysical experiments are mounted to its exterior. But 2 decades after it started to take shape, the ISS has finally found a scientific calling: looking down at its home planet., The ISS is now home to five instruments that observe Earth, with two more set to join this year. One, NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3), was scheduled for launch this week from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a routine resupply mission. Its launch marks a political victory: President Donald Trump has proposed canceling OCO-3 several times, only to be rebuffed each time by Congress. It also marks a victory of expedience over perfection., The ISS is not the ideal platform for OCO-3, which was built to fly on a stand-alone satellite. In fact, \"It's probably not the perfect platform for almost anything,\" says Michael Freilich, who led NASA's earth science division in Washington, D.C. for 12 years until his retirement in February. \"It's big. It flexes. It travels around in a cloud of contaminants.\" And, most important, its orbit misses the poles and revisits sites at a different time each day. But compared with launching a satellite, mounting the instrument on the ISS is vastly cheaper: At $110 million, OCO-3 costs a quarter as much as OCO-2, which launched as a stand-alone mission in 2014., The savings have helped NASA preserve the breadth of its earth science missions, after two spectacular launch failures: the loss of the original OCO satellite, which crashed into the Indian Ocean in 2009, and the 2011 demise of Glory, meant to track atmospheric particles. Although Freilich marshaled support to build OCO-2, costs doubled for several other planned satellites, putting smaller missions in jeopardy., Around this time, Japan added a module to the ISS. Its flat terrace, jutting off its human-habitable module, was a good perch for 10 plug-and-play instruments. If putting Earth-observing instruments there would let NASA get much of the science for a fraction of the cost, that seemed like a good deal, Freilich says. \"Everybody benefits. [NASA's human program] gets to show the utility of the station,\" while the earth science division flies more experiments., OCO-3 will be the third prominent NASA mission to be mounted on the Japanese module within the past year. Ecostress, attached in July 2018, measures the heat given off by plants to gauge the impact of heat waves and drought. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), launched in December 2018, uses a laser to probe the height of tree canopies and understories. Later this year, a Japanese hyperspectral imager that can detect land use and forest type will take a fourth spot. Other instruments mounted elsewhere on the ISS in the past 2 years measure lightning, incoming sunlight, and ozone., Like OCO-2, OCO-3 carries a spectrometer that spies on wavelengths of light absorbed by carbon dioxide (CO2), providing a count of all CO2 molecules on a path from the ISS to the surface. Based on how CO2 concentrations vary from place to place, the missions can map some emission sources along with absorption by plants. But the measurements are difficult given the vast background of CO2 already in the atmosphere., At first the OCO-3 team wasn't thrilled to end up on the ISS, says Annmarie Eldering, the mission's project scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. But they came to see advantages. The erratic timing of its observations will make it challenging for OCO-3 to infer trends over weeks or months but will allow the instrument to explore how plant carbon emissions vary over the course of the day. \"That's going to be very useful,\" Eldering says, especially when combined with measurements taken simultaneously by GEDI and Ecostress., OCO-3's angled perch on the ISS also required a pivoting mount to allow it to see straight down. By pivoting, it can map CO2 over large regions, roughly the size of the Los Angeles, California, basin, during a single pass. Such regional maps could capture emissions from local sources such as cities and industry, says Christopher O'Dell, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, and enable OCO-3 to test the promise of verifying CO2 cuts from space. \"That's the goal,\" O'Dell says. \"We don't know if that's possible.\", The ISS has one key constraint: space. After 3 years, OCO-3 is likely to be displaced on the Japanese module. NASA and Japan are already talking about what will go next to take its slot, Eldering says. Afterward, she says, \"They will take us off and burn us up in the atmosphere.\", Yet the promise of a space-based platform for making multiple simultaneous measurements of Earth at lower cost will live on. Rudranarayan Mukherjee, a JPL engineer, is developing a concept called the Science Station: a robotic mini–space station with trusses and a robotic arm that could host a dozen Earth-observing instruments in low orbit. The space station, he says, \"has shown the benefit of having a platform in lower Earth orbit that's a shared resource.\" NASA hasn't yet committed to the concept, he says. But he adds, \"People can instantly see, yeah, I could see how that could work.\"",

        "abstract": "Opposite approaches to altering the activity of vasopressin in the brain improved some social deficits in people with autism., By Kelly ServickMay. 1, 2019 , 2:10 PM, Many people with autism have trouble making eye contact, reading the emotions in other faces, and sharing affection. And no drugs are approved to treat such social impairments. Now, results from a small academic clinical trial suggest boosting levels of vasopressin—a hormone active in the brain that’s known to promote bonding in many animals—can improve social deficits in children with autism. But in a confusing twist, a larger, company-sponsored trial that took the reverse approach, tamping down vasopressin’s effects, also found some improvements in adults with autism., “I’ve never seen this before,” Kevin Pelphrey, a neuroscientist who studies autism at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, says of the conflicting results. He and others say the vasopressin-blocking approach doesn’t have much support from previous animal research. The new study showed some benefits but failed to meet the main endpoint set out by investigators. Still, he says, both studies suggest vasopressin’s signaling in the brain plays a key role in autism and “give me a lot of renewed excitement” for treating the condition., Though vasopressin seems to stimulate social bonding in animals, the hormone’s activity in the brain isn’t fully understood, and its effects vary by species and context. Blocking its activity in the brains of some rodents prevents them from forming an attraction to a mate. But in a species of asocial hamster, injecting it into a male’s brain seems to stimulate aggression., Another brain signaling molecule with a very similar structure, oxytocin, is already under investigation as an autism treatment. But vasopressin has gotten less attention. Recently, Karen Parker, a neuroscientist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, and her colleagues turned up evidence that monkeys that were less social—that tended to keep their distance from their peers, for example—also had lower levels of vasopressin in their cerebrospinal fluid. The group also found that children with autism who had the most social impairment also had the lowest vasopressin levels., So the Stanford team gave a nasal spray containing vasopressin to 17 children with autism, aged 6 to 12 years. Another 13 children with autism served as a control group and got a placebo spray. Before and after the 4-week treatment, the research team asked parents to rate the children on a questionnaire called the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), which asks how often the children “would rather be alone than with others,” for example, and how often they “avoid eye contact.” This 65-question scale results in gender-adjusted scores of 37 to 90 in girls and 38 to 90 for boys., Vasopressin-treated children showed significantly more improvement—a seven-point-greater reduction—on the SRS-2 than those in the placebo group, the team reported today in Science Translational Medicine (STM)., Those results “are very exciting,” especially because the team didn’t see major side effects, says Angela Sirigu, a neuroscientist at CNRS, the French national research agency, in Bron who is also investigating neurohormones for autism treatment., Children with higher levels of vasopressin in their blood at the start of the Stanford study saw greater improvements. That’s counterintuitive, Sirigu says—you’d expect children who were most deficient in the hormone to benefit most from the boost. These children may have needed a higher dose or longer treatment course to see maximum benefits, Parker speculates. Or maybe blood vasopressin is a marker for some other, yet-unknown feature of the children that predicts how much they’ll improve with the treatment., The only weakness Pelphrey found with the Stanford study was its sample size: “If it were double, I would be jumping up and down.” Still, he says, “I’m kind of rocking back and forth in my chair with excitement.”, The second trial, meanwhile, tested a very different hypothesis about vasopressin. Although many people with autism have trouble interpreting and reciprocating emotions, they also sometimes have overactive emotional responses, says neurologist Paulo Fontoura of Roche Pharmaceuticals in Basel, Switzerland. And vasopressin could drive those responses, he suggests. In a rat model of autism, blocking a vasopressin receptor appeared to reduce the animal’s abnormally heightened brain response to the presence of a juvenile rat. In the new trial, the Roche team recruited 223 men with autism to test a compound called Balovaptan that blocks a vasopressin receptor in the brain. The 148 men who took the drug improved according to an SRS-2 assessment, but those who got a placebo improved just as much, the team reports today in STM. Fontoura and his colleagues say the strong placebo effect in the study suggests the SRS-2 isn’t the best way to measure social improvements. Men receiving Balovaptan did show significant improvements over a placebo group on a different test of autism symptoms, called the Vineland-II., The authors of both studies propose that there could be important differences in their participants. Maybe some people with autism could benefit from boosting vasopressin and others from blocking it., The Stanford group is running another trial of vasopressin that aims to enroll 100 children. Roche has two trials of Balovaptan underway—an initial test in children, and a larger study in adults meant to demonstrate the drug’s effectiveness to regulators. “It’s early to make a head-to-head comparison,” Fontoura says. “It’s only when we do see more data that we’ll be able to draw conclusions about which way is the right way.”",

        "abstract": "Senator Chuck Grassley (R–IA) wants U.S. research agencies to pay more attention to foreign collaborations., By Jeffrey MervisMay. 2, 2019 , 11:45 AM, Responding to the rising concern within Congress that foreign governments are taking advantage of the open U.S. research enterprise, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have recently tweaked their grantmaking process to better monitor the foreign ties of the researchers they fund. And although there are subtle differences in how the two agencies are approaching the task, the goal is the same: to collect more information about the foreign affiliations of grantees. When it comes to policing suspicious relationships, however, neither agency sits in the driver’s seat., Senator Chuck Grassley (R–IA), chair of the Senate Committee on Finance, has been leading a chorus of lawmakers who believe the large number of foreign-born scientists working in the United States—in particular those from China—pose a potential threat to the nation’s research enterprise. And they worry that U.S. universities and government agencies have been slow to respond. A longtime watchdog of federal spending practices, Grassley in recent months has sent nearly identical letters to NIH, NSF, and the Department of Defense (DOD) asking each agency about its practices in rooting out any illegal behavior., Last week, NSF replied to a letter Grassley sent on 15 April. NIH responded at the end of 2018 to a query sent in October 2018, and DOD has yet to reply to a letter it received on 1 April., Each letter contains questions that address Grassley’s fears that the agencies aren’t doing enough. For example, he asks how much they are spending “to identify and investigate potential violations of the rules concerning foreign affiliations and financial” support for an investigator’s research. He also wants to know the number of institutions “currently under investigation [by the agency] for employing individuals who failed to disclose contributions from foreign governments.”, In their responses, NIH and NSF essentially duck both questions. NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, says the cost of monitoring its rules on foreign affiliations can’t be separated from its broader effort to ensure that grantees are complying with all of the agency’s rules. NSF in Alexandria, Virginia, says it works hand in glove with its Office of Inspector General (OIG), which conducts regular audits. NSF’s letter says OIG will reply separately to six of Grassley’s eight queries, noting “the sensitivity of ongoing investigations.”, Both agencies note that their inspectors general (which in the case of NIH is part of its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services) handle any cases in which there is reason to suspect that something is amiss. NIH also points out that some investigations are carried out by the U.S. Department of Justice., The agencies were able to answer some of Grassley’s questions. And their answers highlight the senator’s apparent unfamiliarity with how research agencies perform their duties and interact with the academic community., For example, his first question asks each agency “to describe in detail [how] it conducts background checks of research and institutions” before awarding them a grant. The assumption is that an eagle-eyed program manager should be able to spot a nefarious researcher intent on, say, stealing a patented technology or otherwise depriving Americans of the fruits of taxpayer-funded research., The reality is that NIH and NSF do not perform such background checks. Instead of doing the vetting that legislators apparently think is going on, the agencies demand that grantee institutions certify the researcher is able to perform the work being funded. Institutions can certify that only if they have themselves met all the requirements that come with receiving a federal research grant., “[G]rantee institutions are responsible for the personnel designated on their awards, not NIH,” Lawrence Tabak, NIH’s principal deputy director, explained in the agency’s reply to Grassley. “NIH determines if grant applicants are eligible to receive grant awards but does not conduct background checks.”, Institutions also don’t pry into a scientist’s background when certifying to funding agencies that the researcher can do the proposed work. And they certainly don’t ask why, say, a Chinese, Iranian, or Russian graduate student or postdoctoral researcher wants to come to the United States or—to get to the heart of Grassley’s worries—whether their government has asked them to spy on the U.S. research enterprise., With respect to foreign scientists working in the United States, university administrators assume that anyone awarded the proper visa by the U.S. Department of State has a right to be in the country and participate in the research that has been funded. Any projects dealing with sensitive topics or involving technologies with military and national security implications are already subject to greater scrutiny, including the requirement in some cases that the researchers are U.S. citizens., Grassley’s letter did elicit some information about how the agencies have tightened up their procedures., NIH’s letter notes, for example, that last year it “reminded its grantee institutions about their responsibilities.” That reminder included notifying NIH if a researcher on a grant “was no longer qualified or competent to perform the research objectives.” That is bureaucratic shorthand for an institution finding someone guilty of scientific misconduct or, worse, having the person face civil or criminal charges stemming from their actions as an NIH-funded researcher., One bone of contention for university research administrators trying to follow the rules is how to interpret NIH’s requirement that applicants disclose all “foreign components” of their research. A scientist who spends a week lecturing at a foreign university, for example, might not disclose that trip on their grant application. But if the host university labels them a visiting scientist in promoting their talks, then NIH might wonder whether there is a financial aspect to that relationship., What’s even more likely to raise eyebrows is a foreign scientist who spends 9 months in the United States working in the lab of a U.S. colleague with an NIH grant and then appears as a co-author on a paper published by the U.S. scientist. The visiting scientist is typically seen as a “free” pair of hands by the U.S. scientist because their government foots the bill. But to NIH, the foreign scientist’s name on a publication could suggest that an NIH grantee has failed to disclose a foreign component in their grant application or annual progress report., NSF used its response to Grassley to publicize changes it is making in the paperwork that accompanies every grant application and subsequent monitoring of the researcher it has funded., “NSF is currently in the process of developing a clear, standardized, web-based disclosure form for researchers to list all sources of current and pending support,” explains the letter, signed by Fleming Crim, NSF’s chief operating officer. This change, Crim writes, “will provide NSF with the ability to better manage this data and ensure compliance with the disclosure requirements for all proposals submitted to the agency.”, One change NSF has already made is asking all grant applicants to check a box if their proposal requests funding for a foreign organization or an international branch campus of a U.S.-based institution. Anyone who checks the box must then explain why the research cannot be done at the U.S. institution and what the foreign collaborator brings to the table. NSF officials say that program managers and reviewers may have asked such questions in the past but that the checkbox increases the chances that the issue will be addressed during the review process., NSF’s grants policy manual already requires investigators to list non-NSF projects to which they have allocated some of their time. That clause is not explicitly designed to flag foreign activities, however, nor would it cover things that did not warrant a designated fraction of the faculty member’s work week. “We are currently working toward further clarification of that long-standing requirement,” says Amanda Greenwell, head of NSF’s Office of Legislative and Public Affairs., It is unlikely that the responses from NIH and NSF will end Grassley’s inquiries. In January, he stated that NIH’s letter “left many of my initial questions unanswered” and that he “will continue seeking answers on these and other important questions.” His office is still waiting to hear from DOD, a spokesperson noted. Meanwhile, Allison Lerner, NSF’s inspector general, hasn’t been given a deadline to submit her answers to the six questions she’s been tasked with addressing. But she is expected to move quickly, in line with NSF’s promise to Grassley that “we must take all reasonable and necessary steps to ensure the integrity of federally funded research.”",

        "abstract": "Based on feedback from a monkey neuron, an artificial intelligence algorithm created this weird monkey-gnome., By Emily UnderwoodMay. 2, 2019 , 11:00 AM, Neurons in our brain’s visual cortex respond to remarkably specific stimuli, including the faces of celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston. But researchers have long struggled to determine precisely what images excite individual neurons in this region, because the possibilities are literally infinite. Now, a study has tackled that problem in monkeys, using a computer algorithm that can rapidly figure out what type of image is most stimulating to a neuron. The results reveal hundreds of odd images, including bizarrely distorted, gargoylelike monkey faces., The work is “an incredibly clever and creative application of artificial intelligence to an old problem,” says Bevil Conway, a neuroscientist at the National Eye Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, who was not involved in the research., In the experiment, a monkey with electrodes inserted into its inferior temporal cortex—a brain region involved in object recognition—views a series of pictures. (When this region is damaged in people, they can lose their ability to identify faces and objects, a rare disorder called agnosia.) The images start out devoid of content, a gray blur of visual noise. But based on which ones trigger a selected neuron to fire, a machine learning algorithm creates a new batch of images that the monkey neuron is predicted to “like” even more., Over many iterations, the algorithm produces vaguely recognizable objects, including “gnomelike, monkeyish things,” says Margaret Livingstone, a neurobiologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston and the study’s principal investigator. Some of those images remind Conway of portraits by Pablo Picasso or Francis Bacon., Further testing suggested that, although the same neurons respond to pictures of real monkey faces, they seem to prefer the distorted abstractions—things an animal would never see in real life, Livingstone and her colleagues report today in Cell. Other monkey neurons produce images that look a bit like the monkeys’ food dispenser, or one of the caretakers, named Diane, who wears a protective mask., Why the monkeys prefer the abstracted images to real ones is still a mystery. One possibility is that the neurons work by computing the difference between faces, putting more weight on extreme features like a caricature artist would, Livingstone suggests. That would make them more responsive to such exaggerated features—and it would make them more efficient to have than lots of individual neurons wired to recognize specific faces, she notes. “That way, you get everything in between for free.”, One thing is clear: The majority of the preferred stimuli are learned through experience. “There’s no way a monkey evolved a cell to code for a person wearing protective gear,” Livingston says. The next step is testing the approach in people undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy who agree to be studied while their brains are more accessible, she says. “Then, we’ll be able to learn what neurons in the human brain want.”",

        "abstract": "By Jake BuehlerMay. 1, 2019 , 3:05 PM, Low genetic diversity—often brought on by a mass die-off or inbreeding—has been considered a death knell for species from heath hens to Tasmanian tigers. Without lots of genetic material to reshuffle, future generations are less able to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Now, a new genetic analysis of narwhals is turning that notion on its head: Despite low genetic diversity, these “unicorns” of the ocean seem to be doing just fine., Narwhals, medium-size whales that live in the Arctic, are known for some genetic quirks. After multiple studies uncovered low genetic diversity in several narwhal genes, a team of researchers decided to analyze the whale’s entire genome. Using DNA from the frozen liver tissue of a narwhal found near Greenland, they calculated the genetic variation of the species and estimated the population size of narwhals into the deep past., Their results reveal a profound lack of diversity across the narwhal’s genome, they report today in iScience. Compared with 14 other mammal species, narwhals were far less genetically diverse. For example, bowhead whales have twice as much variation, while pandas’ genomes are more than three times as diverse. What’s more, the team found no evidence of an inbreeding or die-off “bottleneck.” Instead, narwhal populations appear to have declined slowly starting 2 million years ago and have maintained a low genetic diversity for the past million years. Such slowly shrinking diversity has been seen in mountain gorillas and Channel Island foxes, but this time, the common culprits of inbreeding and isolation don’t appear to be to blame., The narwhal’s abundance—there are more than 170,000 living in the wild—may come from a population explosion driven by favorable environmental conditions 115,000 years ago. Since then, genetic diversity may simply have not had enough to time to catch up. But the researchers note that the narwhal isn’t totally out of the woods; with a range restricted to the rapidly warming Arctic, it’s unclear whether the narwhal’s uniform genome will be able to cope with ongoing climate change.",

        "abstract": "By Kai KupferschmidtMay. 2, 2019 , 2:00 PM, Throughout history, making a blue pigment has taken hard work—or a stroke of luck, CORVALLIS, OREGON—Mas Subramanian's most celebrated discovery came out of the blue., As a solid state chemist at the chemical giant Dupont, Subramanian had put his name on hundreds of publications and dozens of patents. He identified a new superconductor and found a more environmentally friendly route to produce the chemical fluorobenzene. When he left the company to work at Oregon State University here in 2006, he set out to develop a multiferroic, a material with a combination of electronic and magnetic properties that could lead to faster computers., Following one of Subramanian's ideas, graduate student Andrew Smith one day mixed indium oxide, manganese oxide, and yttrium oxide and heated the mixture in the oven. The resulting material, it turned out, didn't have any special magnetic or electric properties. It was just very blue., Subramanian's first thought was that Smith, who had recently switched from marine biology to chemistry, had made a mistake. His second thought was something that someone at Dupont had once told him: Blue is really hard to make., It's so hard, in fact, that Subramanian's new color became a phenomenon. The New York Times called within days after his paper on YInMn blue, as he dubbed it, appeared in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Shepherd Color Company in Cheltenham, Australia, licensed the new pigment, which art historian Simon Schama has called \"the bluest blue to date,\" and marketed it as a paint for artists. The new hue has inspired a music festival, and chip company AMD is using it to dye the housing of a series of graphics processors. \"There is something about the color blue that just fascinates people,\" Subramanian says., Humans made pigments from red and yellow ochre and charcoal at least 100,000 years ago, but they didn't have blue. The Babylonians and Egyptians used bits of lapis lazuli, a blue semiprecious stone, in statuary and art, but the laborious process needed to turn it into the pigment ultramarine was only discovered in the sixth century B.C.E. (Recent evidence from a burial site in Turkey suggests people also ground the blue mineral azurite down to a fine powder 9000 years ago, possibly for cosmetics.), \"There is something about … blue that just fascinates people,\" says Mas Subramanian, discoverer of YInMn blue., With natural blues scarce, people have tried to make their own. Ancient Egyptians mixed sand, plant ash, and copper to create Egyptian blue, the first synthetic pigment, about 5000 years ago. In the 19th century, chemists raced to create a synthetic ultramarine, and BASF spent an unprecedented 18 million gold marks, more than the company was worth at the time, to synthesize indigo, a deep blue dye from plants. These blues became some of the most sought after products of the booming chemical industry., Yet blue pigments are still rare. Most blues in nature don't come from pigments that humans can co-opt. Animals such as the morpho butterfly and the blue jay appear blue not because of a pigment, but because their feathers or scales contain nanostructures that reflect light in a way that cancels out all but the blue wavelengths., To appear blue, a dye or a pigment needs to absorb red light, which usually happens when red photons boost electrons in the pigment molecule from one energy level to the next. Because red light has the lowest energy of any visible light, those two energy levels need to be very close together—and such closely spaced energy rungs are found only in complicated molecules that are hard for organisms to make., Plants have evolved many classes of pigments: Chlorophylls color leaves green; carotenoids come in orange (carrots), red (tomatoes), and yellow (maize); and betalains produce the red color of beetroot. But only one class of pigments is capable of producing blue: the anthocyanins. (The word literally means \"blue flower.\") And even most anthocyanins are not blue but red, because they naturally absorb blue light; only if the plant tacks on chemical groups can the molecule shift toward absorbing red., In minerals, too, blue is a special case. Subramanian discovered that YInMn's color is created by a manganese ion surrounded by five oxygen atoms in a structure resembling two three-sided pyramids glued together at the bottom, a geometry rarely seen in natural minerals., Designing materials from scratch to produce blue is difficult even today, Subramanian says. \"So much chemistry has to come together,\" he says. Subtle changes in the arrangement of neighboring atoms can throw off the energy levels of an atom's electrons, altering the color it can absorb. The red of rubies and the green of emeralds both spring from chromium ions surrounded by six oxygen atoms; other atoms in the two stones cause the color difference by altering the chromium's energy levels. Such effects are very hard to predict, Subramanian says: \"If rubies and emeralds did not exist in nature, no one would know how to create them.\", But scientists have not given up hunting for new blues, continuing an age-old quest with 21st century tools. Although Subramanian's discovery came about by accident, other researchers are methodically using physics, chemistry, and genetics to find or create new blues for painters to dazzle with, edible colorants that make food more interesting, and blue flowers that, so far, only exist in artists' imaginations., Blue roses are the stuff of poems. Scientists are trying to make them reality, KYOTO, JAPAN—In 2004, Japanese researchers unveiled what they billed as the world's first blue rose. The only problem with the flower: It wasn't very blue., Although its petals did produce a blue pigment, the overall appearance of the flower was more mauve. Even Yoshikazu Tanaka, the scientist behind the work, admits that his first thought on seeing the flower was: \"could be bluer.\", Fifteen years later, he is still trying to make that bluer rose. Tanaka works at the global research center of Japanese beverage giant Suntory, which grew out of Japan's first whisky distillery, opened in 1923. (The brand was made famous by the movie Lost in Translation, in which an aging actor played by Bill Murray shoots a whisky commercial in Tokyo.) The company decided to branch out into the cut-flower market in the 1980s after a tax hike made Japanese liquor more expensive. Company legend has it that the idea was to paint the English rose the Scottish national color, blue, as a kind of thank you for the invention of whisky, Tanaka says., More likely, it just seemed a good business idea. After all, blue flowers are rare, including among cut flowers. Chrysanthemums, carnations, tulips—none of them naturally comes in blue. Blue orchids have usually been artificially dyed. Decades of breeding have yielded roses in every shade of yellow, pink, and red, but never blue ones., In 2017, Japanese scientists announced the creation of blue chrysanthemums., Artists have long noted this rarity. In German romanticism, the blue flower became a symbol of longing and the unattainable. Rudyard Kipling dedicated a poem to someone tasked by his lover to find her a blue rose: \"Half the world I wandered through/Seeking where such flowers grew.\", By the time he returns empty-handed, his love has died., Scientists got their first glimpse of the complexity behind blue flowers in 1913, when German researcher Richard Willstätter announced he had isolated the blue pigment from cornflowers. It was an anthocyanin he named cyanidin. Two years later, when he isolated the pigment of red roses, it turned out to be the exact same molecule. Anthocyanins can change color depending on the acidity of a solution, so Willstätter proposed that roses had a different hue because the pH in their petals was lower than in cornflowers., It was the first scientific theory about blue flowers. And it was wrong. Over the following decades, a different story emerged, one that was finally confirmed by x-ray crystallography in 2005. Cyanidin itself does not produce a stable blue color; instead, cornflowers combine six molecules of cyanidin with six molecules of a colorless copigment arranged around two metal ions—a huge molecular complex that stabilizes the cyanidin molecules and allows one electron to make the right energy transition. \"Flowers are doing crazy chemistry to generate that blue,\" says Beverley Glover, a botanist at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom., Several other blue flowers have hit on the same trick, but most produce a different anthocyanin, called delphinidin, that can more easily be coaxed to appear blue. The only difference between cyanidin and delphinidin is that the latter has an extra oxygen atom on one of its rings, put there by an enzyme called flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase. The entire family of roses, which includes apples and pears, lacks the enzyme, which means that delphinidin-producing roses can't be produced through traditional breeding., Yoshikazu Tanaka with the \"blue\" roses developed in his lab. His search for a bluer version continues., Tanaka is trying genetic engineering instead. By 1991, he and his colleagues had identified and patented the flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase gene in petunias. Transferring that gene into carnations coaxed them into producing delphinidin, turning them a purplish blue. But when the team shuttled the gene into roses, using the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a courier, they didn't start to produce the blue pigment for some reason. It was the same gene from pansies that finally led to the delphinidinmaking—but not very blue—rose unveiled in 2004. Apparently, producing delphinidin alone wasn't enough. Scientists had to do some crazy chemistry themselves., Since then, Tanaka's main strategy has been to transfer genes from bellflowers, pansies, and other blue flowers to \"decorate\" delphinidin chemically, hoping to hit a magic combination. Last year, he showed a visitor hundreds of tiny rose plants growing under fluorescent lights in his lab. \"All of them are just to get a new blue color,\" he said., In the meantime, however, a collaboration between Tanaka and a group led by Naonobu Noda at the Institute of Vegetable and Floriculture Science in Tsukuba, Japan, has led to an indisputably blue flower: a blue chrysanthemum. In a 2017 Science Advances paper, the researchers reported that inserting the flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase gene from bellflowers into red chrysanthemums, along with a gene that adds a glucose molecule, resulted in \"the most blueshifted flowers\" ever genetically engineered. Their idea was that the glucose would allow the flower's natural enzymes to attach further chemical groups to delphinidin, creating a stronger blue. To their surprise, added groups weren't necessary; instead, the glucose helped delphinidin assemble with copigments naturally produced in the flower, shifting the color to blue., Using the exact same strategy has not worked in roses, probably because they don't have the same copigments and have a lower pH. But Tanaka has not given up. He has tried to add genes from gentian that modify the delphinidin and genes from the genus Torenia that produce copigments. In a nod to Willstätter, he is even trying to change the pH in the rose petals., Tanaka is confident he will develop bluer roses before his retirement, only 5 years away, but almost 30 years of pursuing his quest have also taught him to be cautious: \"It is hard to say how blue they will be.\", Scientists are looking for a natural pigment to turn food blue, NORWICH, U.K.—At first, Cathie Martin was interested in the nutritional value of food pigments. Then, she became obsessed with blue food for its own sake., A decade ago, Martin, a scientist at the John Innes Centre here, genetically engineered tomatoes to produce anthocyanins in their fruits, so that other scientists could compare their dietary effects in humans with those of regular tomatoes. But the pigments also turned the vegetable a dark, purplish blue. And Martin began to wonder how to make other food blue., Few foods are naturally blue, but the color has long been in demand as a food colorant. Synthetic ultramarine was once used to whiten cane sugar, which has a yellowish tinge. Blue food dyes are used to color candy, coatings, or drinks. They are also mixed with other colors. \"We must have blue to make all the colors of the spectrum,\" says Richard van Breemen, a chemist who investigates natural products at Oregon State University in Corvallis., Currently, there's not a lot to choose from. Two synthetic blue food dyes are approved in the United States: Brilliant blue, also named blue No. 1, was originally made from coal tar, like many synthetic dyes, and blue No. 2, or indigo karmine, is derived from synthetic indigo. Another synthetic blue colorant is available in the European Union: patent blue V, which gives blue curaçao liqueur its hue., A bluish doughnut frosting developed in Cathie Martin's lab contains a mix of anthocyanins found in butterfly pea flowers., Because consumers prefer natural ingredients, big companies such as Mars and Pepsi have invested in replacements for the synthetic colorants, with little success so far. \"One of the big frustrations with the color blue is that it is very, very difficult to reproduce the colors that you see in nature with compounds that can be used in the same way for coloring food,\" Martin says., The only natural blue colorant is a crude extract derived from spirulina algae that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for use in confectionery and other food in 2014. But it is not very stable, Martin says—or very blue, for that matter. \"It's a terrible blue,\" she says. \"It's green really.\" And the color may change or disappear when foods are baked or boiled or exposed to light on grocery shelves., Van Breemen has looked for better candidates in the microbial world. Reasoning that he was more likely to find stable blues in extreme conditions, he studied microbes from the hot springs at Yellowstone National Park, for instance; he also searched in marine bacteria. But none of the blue pigments he found was suitable. Many are chemical weapons, which the microbes release to fight other microbes, he says—making them more promising as antibiotics than as food colorants., Plants may be a better bet, and they offer many compounds to choose from. Although most blue flowers create pigments based on delphinidin, they vary the molecule by adding different chemical groups, and many of the intermediates in the chemical pathway leading to delphinidin are blue as well. Martin is hoping she'll find a safe, stable food dye in the butterfly pea, whose beautiful blue flowers give the Malay rice dish nasi kerabu its blue color. (The flower's color, however, was not what most struck the men who gave the genus its Latin name, Clitoria.), Martin initially bought Clitoria blossoms online, from Amazon, but stocks soon ran out; more recently, she received three bulging bags of blossoms from Saudi Arabia, where a scientist who had visited her lab asked people to collect them in the wild. A mix of butterfly pea anthocyanins has worked well for some food applications, Martin says. Researchers in her lab have used it to make bluish frosting for cupcakes and doughnuts as well as blue ice cream., But these pigments, too, are fleeting. \"Most blue anthocyanins have a half-life of about 24 hours. And we're talking about something that needs at least about 3 months,\" Martin says. So her quest continues., A mineral created under immense pressure inspired the search for a new pigment, LONDON—Geologist David Dobson of University College London (UCL) never realized that blue pigments are a big deal until he saw the excitement that a sample of the world's newest blue, Mas Subramanian's YInMn, created among colleagues at UCL's Slade School of Fine Art. \"I thought: Hang on a minute,\" Dobson says. \"I'm making blue all the time in my lab.\", Dobson studies the transition zone, the part of Earth's mantle that stretches from about 410 to 660 kilometers beneath our feet. In his lab, he squeezes mineral samples in a machine called a multianvil cell to replicate the gigantic pressure at those depths—about 200,000 times that at Earth's surface. Under those circumstances, the four elements that make up olivine, the most common mineral in the mantle—iron, magnesium, silicon, and oxygen—form a different mineral called ringwoodite, whose physical and chemical properties Dobson is studying. The millimeter-size crumbs of ringwoodite also happen to be a deep blue., A small piece of ringwoodite produced in David Dobson's lab. Dobson hopes to produce a new blue pigment that has a similar structure but is more stable., Having seen the success of YInMn, Dobson decided to turn his deep-Earth blue into a new pigment. He expects it will find a market, if only because not everybody sees YInMn as the perfect blue. The rare earth element indium, one of its ingredients, makes it expensive; a 40-milliliter tube of the acrylic paint that made a splash at the Slade School, produced by a company named Derivan, sells for $130 or more. And it \"was actually a bit soupy,\" says Jo Volley, a lecturer at the Slade School., First, Dobson had to understand where ringwoodite's color comes from. \"Everyone was used to it being blue, and no one had really considered that much why,\" he says. He found that the color arises not from an energy transition within one atom, but from the exchange of an electron between two types of iron ions, Fe2+ and Fe3+. (The same mechanism accounts for the color of Prussian blue, a pigment discovered by chance in 1706 when Berlin alchemists used contaminated potash in a recipe for a red pigment.) Ringwoodite's structure, with the iron ions surrounded by four oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral coordination, creates the right conditions for the electron swap to absorb red light. But that arrangement is stable only at the huge pressure in Earth's interior. At the surface, even simply grinding the mineral destroys the structure—and the color., Dobson tried to create a similar structure that is stable at a pressure of 1 atmosphere by starting with zinc germanate, a mineral that also has metal ions—in this case zinc and germanium—surrounded by oxygen atoms. If enough iron replaces the zinc and germanium, the structure turns blue, Dobson says. He has already produced a sample of re-engineered zinc germanate in his lab, and it is blue—but he hopes to make the color richer by adding more iron., Three centuries ago, Dutch painter Pieter van der Werff used newly discovered Prussian blue to color the sky and Mary's veil in a painting depicting the entombment of Christ. Subramanian's wife Rajeevi—a solid state chemist as well as an artist—was the first to use YInMn; it proved perfect for a painting of Crater Lake, not far from the couple's home, which is famous for its deep blue water., Dobson hopes to develop a pigment that is similarly appealing. As the first blue pigment to be designed from scratch, rather than accidentally discovered or borrowed from nature, it would open a new chapter in humanity's love affair with blue.",

        "abstract": "As it was domesticated, the African yam got bigger, starchier, and more regular in shape., By Elizabeth PennisiMay. 1, 2019 , 2:00 PM, Wheat and other plants that feed much of the world today were likely first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East. But another early cradle of agriculture lay thousands of kilometers away, around West Africa's Niger River Basin, a flurry of plant genomic studies is showing. Several of the continent's traditional food crops got their start there: a cereal called pearl millet and Africa's own version of rice. Now, a report out this week in Science Advances adds yams to the list of African crops domesticated thousands of years ago in that same area. A drying climate may have spurred the move to farming, says Yves Vigouroux, a population geneticist at the French Research Institute for Development (IRD) in Montpellier who led some of the new work., The recent findings pinpoint the wild ancestors of some of Africa's most important crops, highlighting reservoirs of genes that could be exploited to boost the productivity and disease resistance of the domesticated varieties, he adds. Such improvements could be life savers on a continent where population is expanding, and climate change threatens crop yields. \"When we study evolution of crops across time, it helps us to see varieties [that] are more resilient,\" says Alemseged Beldados, an archaeobotanist at Addis Ababa University. \"It will help us single out better breeds.\", Generations of archaeologists have studied plant domestication in the Middle East as well as in Asia and the Americas. \"But Africa has very much lagged behind,\" says Dorian Fuller, an archaeobotanist at University College London. Plant fossils and farming artifacts are less likely to be preserved in Africa's warm, moist environments, funding is scarce, and field research often faces political and logistical challenges., Genetic studies, however, bypass some of these difficulties. In 2002, Nora Scarcelli, a population geneticist colleague of Vigouroux's at IRD, took an interest in yams, the most important root crop in Africa before the introduction of cassava in the 1500s and still more important than maize in parts of Africa., The vines of the African yam (Dioscorea rotundata) produce large tubers that look a bit like American sweet potatoes (sometimes mistakenly called yams), but the plant is a different species that is also distinct from Asian yams. But whether the modern African crop was derived from D. abyssinica, a wild yam that grows in the savanna, or D. praehensilis, which thrives in the wetter rainforests, was not known. Hoping to resolve the issue, Scarcelli and colleagues recently sequenced and compared 167 genomes of wild and domesticated yams gathered from Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon. The DNA of savanna wild yams was fairly similar, but the forest wild yams split into two groups, one centered in Cameroon and another much farther west., Wild yams such as these were cultivated into an African crop., Scarcelli, Vigouroux, and their colleagues further identified forest yams in the Niger River Basin, between eastern Ghana and western Nigeria, as the source of the modern domesticate. Their analysis could not pinpoint the date of domestication, but it did identify genes that changed along the way. Variations in genes for water regulation probably helped convert a forest dweller into a plant that thrives in open sun. Alterations in root development and starch production genes also likely made tubers regularly shaped and richer in starch., A similar study of pearl millet (Cenchrus americanus), the most important cereal for arid areas of Africa and Asia with poor soils, also pointed to a West African origin. When Vigouroux and his colleagues sequenced and compared the genomes of 221 wild (Pennisetum glaucum monodii) and domesticated millets, they concluded that all domesticated pearl millet varieties came from a single ancestor growing north of the Niger River in part of the western Sahara Desert that today includes northern Mali and Mauritania. The genetic work, reported last year in Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution, dovetails nicely with a 2011 discovery of 4500-year-old pearl millet remains in an archaeological site in southeastern Mali, Fuller adds., Previous studies had shown that about 6000 years ago, probably before millet was domesticated, a moist climate created a network of lakes in the region, yielding abundant wild food. As the climate dried and those lakes vanished, Vigouroux hypothesizes, the local people began to cultivate plants., And over more time, people and plants shifted southward, with cultivated plants intermittently interbreeding with wild plants. The mingling slowed full domestication but added genetic variation to the millet. \"Our findings stressed the importance of wild-to-crop gene flow during and after crop domestication,\" Vigouroux and his colleagues wrote., African rice (Oryza glaberrima) is less important today than the other traditional crops, having been mostly replaced with Asian rice. But it, too, got a West African start. Last year in Current Biology, Vigouroux and his colleagues analyzed 163 varieties of the domesticated African rice and 83 samples of wild rice collected from west and east Africa. Their analysis showed the cultivated species has about half as much genetic diversity as the wild species, and that it arose from wild relatives in northern Mali. They also found that some of the same genetic changes central to the taming of Asian rice, such as a gene deletion that made the plant grow more erect, also played a part in the domestication of African rice., Other researchers have tracked down additional genes that aided African rice domestication. In the March issue of PLOS Genetics, they described the evolution of genes that make rice seeds less likely to fall off the stalks. Such a detailed history is easier to piece together for African rice than Asian rice because so many wild populations are still intact, says evolutionary geneticist Michael Purugganan of New York University in New York City, who led the work. Studies in Africa \"may tell us more about crop domestication than what people have learned about other crops elsewhere,\" he adds., While Vigouroux focuses on climate to explain why agriculture arose in this part of Africa, archaeologist Sylvain Ozainne from the University of Geneva in Switzerland suggests movements of Saharan pastoralists helped initiate and spread a culture of crop growing, particularly of pearl millet. \"Rather than a direct response to abrupt climatic change, the expansion of African agriculture may be better explained through a more complex process, which involved socioeconomic transformations,\" he says., In Africa, as elsewhere, crop domestication was a long, drawn-out process. It happened outside the Niger River Basin as well. Sorghum was likely tamed in East Africa. Last month, Nature Plants published a genetic analysis of wild and domesticated sorghum samples excavated from an archaeological site in Egypt that spans several thousands years. It showed that early farmers either deliberately crossed this crop—now the sixth most widely grown in the world—with wild relatives and with domesticates from other places, or cultivated varieties that naturally interbred., All this genetic exchange ultimately helped improve the final crop, says Emuobosa Akpo Orijemie, an archaeobotanist at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. The new findings, he adds, \"speak about how intelligent our ancestors were in terms of selecting and managing crops for a variety of uses.\", *Correction, 3 May, 9:50 a.m.: An earlier version of this story misstated that the Nok were Saharan pastoralists.",

        "abstract": "By Meredith WadmanApr. 30, 2019 , 5:10 PM, Breaking with their 156-year history, members of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) today voted overwhelmingly in favor of amending the elite organization’s bylaws to allow ejection of members who breach the group’s new Code of Conduct, which outlines offenses including sexual harassment. Historically, membership in NAS has been an honor conferred for life., Marcia McNutt, president of NAS, noted “the importance of the signal that [today’s vote] sends. And I’m grateful for the many members who showed support for it.”, The vote by those who attended NAS’s annual business meeting in Washington, D.C., this morning was lopsided: 95 in favor; nine against; and six abstaining, according to one member who attended. But it is not final. Because of the seriousness of the proposed change to the bylaws, all 2347 academy members will be offered the chance to vote either online or by mail, which should be completed by mid-June, NAS explained in a statement. The change will require approval from a simple majority of voting members., The vote, which would allow ejection of a member for a range of offenses against the code of conduct, including bullying, discrimination, and fabrication of research, marked the culmination of months of groundwork by McNutt and NAS’s council. They were spurred by a wave of #MeToo-era revelations of sexual harassment by scientists, including NAS members, as well as by a landmark report that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued last year that documented widespread sexual harassment in science, engineering, and medicine., “Finally we are starting to have enough women in powerful positions to make things happen. I’m glad I lived this long to see it,” says Nancy Hopkins, who spoke in support of the amendment at today’s meeting and is a professor emeritus of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. Hopkins was the driving force behind MIT’s groundbreaking examination of its own discriminatory treatment of female faculty 25 years ago., Vicki Lundblad, a biologist who last year settled a gender discrimination lawsuit against her institution, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California, traveled to the NAS annual meeting in order to attend today’s meeting and vote on the amendment. The vote today “is a big deal,” she said afterward. “I think a lot of young people in science are looking at us and thinking: ‘Is [sexual harassment in science] going to change?’”, Lundblad credited the move by NAS leaders to advocacy by neuroscientist BethAnn McLaughlin of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, who is also the founder of the nonprofit #MeTooSTEM. In May 2018, McLaughlin launched a petition urging the NAS to eject sexual harassers., McLaughlin called today’s vote “one of the many important steps every scientific society needs to take to ensure safety. Our science leaders should be ahead of the curve on decency and equity.”, As ScienceInsider reported earlier this month, the bylaw amendment would allow a member’s ouster by a two-thirds vote of NAS’s 17-member council. An ejection vote would mark the last step in a process that could be initiated by anyone. That process would rely on NAS being presented with credible official findings from investigations by outside bodies and could end in less severe punishment., During this morning’s discussion, there were strong statements of support for the amendment. But a few participants raised fears that the process leading to a member’s ejection, as developed by McNutt and NAS’s council, could be misused. Some evoked the climate of fear created in the 1950s by then-Senator Joseph McCarthy (R–WI), who accused people holding all kinds of positions of supporting communism and tried to force from their positions. Some suggested every NAS member should vote on each individual ouster, rather than deferring that decision to the NAS council., NAS member Charles Bennett, an expert in the physics of computation at IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, tried but failed, on procedural grounds, to amend the amendment. His proposed change would have limited ejection to those members who breached the code of conduct prior to being elected to NAS, but whose offenses were only later discovered. Members found to be guilty of present-day misconduct, he proposed, should not be kicked out but should be labeled as “disgraced” members—a designation that could later be reversed, he said, recalling the case of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a father of the atomic bomb, whose security clearance was revoked in 1954 for his alleged communist associations but who was later politically rehabilitated., “If there was a consensus” at the meeting, Bennett emailed afterward, “it was that the bylaw change itself, opening up the possibility of rescinding membership, was an important and necessary step, but that figuring out how and under what conditions to do it would not be a simple matter.”, But McNutt was able to answer concerns about the process persuasively enough to win yes votes from nearly 90% of the those in the room. “Members were strongly in favor of the amendment,” she said. “But their concern was: ‘The devil’s in the details.’ All I had to remind them was: ‘The amendment doesn’t have any of the details.’”, Those process details, she adds, are malleable, and can be adjusted by NAS members as time goes on., She also noted that the final vote is not a done deal: “If we really want to back up our code of conduct, we need to get this amendment into place.”",

        "abstract": "A jawbone was found by a Chinese monk in a holy cave high on the Tibetan Plateau., By Ann GibbonsMay. 1, 2019 , 1:00 PM, Thirty-nine years ago, a Buddhist monk meditating in a cave on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau found something strange: a human jawbone with giant molars. The fossil eventually found its way to scientists. Now, almost 4 decades later, a groundbreaking new way to identify human fossils based on ancient proteins shows the jaw belonged to a Denisovan, a mysterious extinct cousin of Neanderthals., The jawbone is the first known fossil of a Denisovan outside of Siberia's Denisova Cave in Russia, and gives paleoanthropologists their first real look at the face of this lost member of the human family. \"We are finally ‘cornering’ the elusive Denisovans,\" paleoanthropologist María Martinón-Torres of the National Research Center on Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain, wrote in an email. \"We are getting their smiles!\", Together, the jaw's anatomy and the new method of analyzing ancient proteins could help researchers learn whether other mysterious fossils in Asia are Denisovan. \"We now can use this fossil and this wonderful new tool to classify other fossil remains that we can't agree on,\" says paleoanthropologist Aida Gomez-Robles of University College London, who reviewed the paper, which appears in Nature this week., The international team of researchers also reports that the jawbone is at least 160,000 years old. Its discovery pushes back the earliest known presence of humans at high altitude by about 120,000 years., A massive search for Denisovans has been underway ever since paleogeneticists extracted DNA from the pinkie of a girl who lived more than 50,000 years ago in Denisova Cave and found she was a new kind of human. Max Planck Society researchers have since sequenced DNA from several Denisovans from the cave, but the fossils—isolated teeth and bits of bone—were too scanty to show what this enigmatic hominin looked like. Denisovans must have been widespread, because many living people in Melanesia and Southeast Asia carry traces of DNA from multiple encounters between modern humans and Denisovans. But although intriguing fossils across Asia could be Denisovan, they have not yielded the DNA that could confirm their identity., Enter the new jawbone, found by an unidentified monk in Baishiya Karst Cave in Xiahe county in China at an altitude of 3200 meters on the margins of the Tibetan Plateau, according to co-author Dongju Zhang, an archaeologist at Lanzhou University in northwestern China. She traced the jawbone's discovery by interviewing local people in Xiahe, who told her they remembered human bones from the large cave, which is next to a Buddhist shrine and is still a holy place as well as a tourist attraction. Recognizing the jaw's unusual nature, the monk gave it to the sixth Gung-Thang living Buddha, one of China's officially designated \"living Buddhas,\" who consulted scholars and then gave the jaw to Lanzhou University. The jawbone was so \"weird\" that researchers there didn't know how to classify it, and it sat on shelves for years, Zhang says., The proteins in this lower jawbone identify it as Denisovan., She and geologist Fahu Chen, also from Lanzhou University and the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research in Beijing, showed the jaw to paleoanthropologist Jean-Jacques Hublin of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. After seeing its large molars—as big as ones found in Denisova Cave—Hublin immediately suspected it was Denisovan., Max Planck paleogeneticists couldn't get DNA from the jaw, but Hublin's graduate student Frido Welker had found in his doctoral work that Neanderthals, modern humans, and Denisovans differ in the amino acid sequence of key proteins. Welker, now a postdoc at the University of Copenhagen, was able to extract collagen, a common structural protein, from a molar of the Xiahe jawbone. He found its amino acid sequence most closely matched that of Denisovans., Other team members dated a carbonate crust that had formed on the skull by measuring the radioactive decay of uranium in the carbonate. They got a date of 160,000 years ago—a \"firm minimum date\" for the skull, says geochronologist Rainer Grün of Griffith University in Nathan, Australia, who is not a member of the team., The date suggests Denisovans would have had tens of thousands of years to adapt to the altitude of Tibet by the time modern humans arrived in the region, some 30,000 to 40,000 years ago. Encounters between modern humans and Denisovans adapted to high altitude could explain how the Tibetans of today came by a Denisovan gene that helps them cope with thin air. \"It seems likely that ancestral Tibetans interacted with Denisovans, as they began to move upslope,\" archaeologist David Madsen of the University of Texas in Austin wrote in an email., The jaw's features could be a template for spotting other Denisovans. \"Its distinct large molars and premolar roots differ from those of Neanderthals,\" and the jawbone \"is very primitive and robust,\" says Hublin, who sees a resemblance to a jawbone found off the coast of Taiwan known as the Penghu mandible., What anatomy can't confirm, proteins might. \"The protein analyses allow us to see landscapes where DNA cannot reach\"—from warmer climates or much more ancient sites where fragile DNA doesn't persist, Martinón-Torres says. Other researchers have a half-dozen fossils they want to test for proteins or compare with the Xiahe jaw., The implications are far-reaching. \"Forget the textbooks,\" says archaeologist Robin Dennell of the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom. \"Human evolution in Asia is far more complex than we currently understand, and probably does involve multiple lineages, some of which probably engaged with our species.\", Meanwhile, Chen and Zhang did their first excavation at the cave in December 2018, with permission from local villagers and Buddhists. They dug two small trenches where they have already found stone tools and cut-marked rhino and other animal bones. \"We do have hope we'll find more Denisovans,\" Zhang says.",

        "abstract": "By Rachel FrittsApr. 30, 2019 , 12:20 PM, Amphipods—small, shrimplike crustaceans in most aquatic ecosystems—start to fall apart once they hit depths of 4500 meters. There, a combination of crushing pressures, low temperature, and higher acidity causes the calcium carbonate in their exoskeletons to dissolve, making them vulnerable to pressure and predators. Now, scientists have discovered how one species, Hirondellea gigas, can survive in the deepest part of the ocean: with aluminum suits of armor., Researchers first analyzed H. gigas specimens found at the bottom of the Challenger Deep, more than 10,000 meters below the surface of the ocean. They found that this extreme amphipod constructs a personal suit of armor—a layer of aluminum hydroxide gel covering the surface of its exoskeleton. But aluminum isn’t abundant in ocean water, making it hard to source as a building material. It is, however, abundant in ocean sediment., To figure out how H. gigas accesses its aluminum, the team exposed sediment from the Challenger Deep—which the crustacean likely swallows when eating—to chemicals in its gut. Within that acidic environment, a byproduct of the plants in its typical diet reacts with the metal-rich sediment to free up aluminum ions. When these aluminum ions are released into alkaline seawater, they transform into protective aluminum hydroxide gel, the researchers report this month in PLOS ONE., The aluminum armor appears to both relieve stress from deep-sea pressures and prevent the amphipod exoskeletons from leaching calcium carbonate and disintegrating. Thanks to these findings, scientists are one step closer to understanding how it is possible to survive in one of the world’s harshest environments.",

        "abstract": "Representative Tim Ryan (R–OH) leads a spending panel that wants to revive the congressional Office of Technology Assessment., By David MalakoffApr. 30, 2019 , 3:55 PM, Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives want to bring back Congress’s long-dead science advice office. A draft funding bill released today calls for providing $6 million to re-establish the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), which Republican lawmakers killed in 1995., Congress established OTA in 1972 to advise federal lawmakers on a wide range of science-related issues. During its existence, it churned out some 750 reports and white papers assessing the potential promise, peril, and policy challenges associated with emerging technologies such as genetic engineering and space-based weaponry. Fans of the office lauded its reports, but some Republican lawmakers came to view it as duplicative, wasteful, and biased against their party. During the 1994 elections, then-Representative Newt Gingrich (R–GA) vowed to kill the office if his party took control of Congress, which it did. At the time of OTA’s dismantling in 1995, it had about 140 staffers and a budget of roughly $21 million., Since then, numerous advocacy organizations and politicians, including AAAS in Washington, D.C., (publisher of ScienceInsider) and 2016 presidential candidate Hilary Clinton, have called for restoring OTA. And when Democrats took control of the House after last year’s elections, they promised to consider ways to make that happen., Today, Representative Tim Ryan (D–OH), the chair of the House appropriations panel that oversees the legislative branch’s spending, followed through on that pledge by including money for OTA in a $3.9 billion spending bill for the 2020 fiscal year that begins 1 October. Restoring OTA, Ryan said in a statement, “will help Congress understand technology developments and pave the way for better technology and science policy.” The agency would “provide unbiased expert assistance to help Congress understand the potential and the risks of technological developments and the policy options for addressing issues those developments raise,” states a fact sheet accompanying the bill., Ryan’s subcommittee is expected to approve the OTA funding Wednesday, and it is also likely to get a friendly reception in the full House, which is controlled by Democrats. But it’s not clear whether the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, will include funding for OTA in its version of the legislative branch funding bill, which has yet to appear., Today’s move “is an important step and long overdue,” says AAAS CEO Rush Holt. “It represents a foot in the door that could allow OTA to turn the lights on and get the office going so that it can grow to a functional size.”",

        "abstract": "Chironex fleckeri is one of 51 known species of box jellyfish, whose venom is among the world’s deadliest., By Bethany AugliereApr. 30, 2019 , 11:00 AM, The sting of a box jellyfish can kill a person in minutes. But scientists have long been at pains to figure out the secret of its fast-acting venom, which can also cause severe agony, inflammation, and heart attacks. A new study may have the answer—and a potential antidote., The finding is “tour de force,” says Angel Yanagihara, a biochemist who studies jellyfish venom at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, but who wasn’t involved with the work., Up to 40 people die each year from box jellies, according to available figures. But that number is vastly underreported, Yanagihara says. “People die and there is no trace in the public records.” In the Philippines alone, she estimates some 500 people die from box jelly stings each year. And as the ocean warms—and as the range and number of box jellyfish rises—problematic encounters will likely increase., But to date, no one knows how the box jelly’s venom targets and enters human cells. Previous work on their venom has shown that pore-forming proteins, called porins, destroy red blood cells and damage cell membranes, potentially resulting in pain and death. Yet, more components could be responsible., In the new study, geneticist Greg Neely of the University of Sydney in Australia and colleagues collected live Chironex fleckeri, the species of box jellyfish responsible for most human deaths, from coastal waters off of the Northern Territory of Australia. They soaked the tentacles in seawater, recovered the capsules that contain the stinging cells, and then broke them with tiny glass beads to release the venom, which they freeze-dried., Next, the scientists generated a pool of millions of myeloid cells, each of which was missing one of 19,050 genes. (Because the cells, derived from a leukemia patient, have just one set of chromosomes, they are often used for genetic screening tests.) Then, the scientists added the freeze-dried venom and looked for cells that didn’t die. If a cell survived, they sequenced its DNA to identify which gene was missing—and thus, which made proteins that were likely targeted by the venom., The screen suggested four genes involved in cholesterol production were the venom’s targets, they report today in Nature Communications. So, Neely’s team tested the ability of existing cholesterol-targeting drugs to see whether they could also block the venom. Two drugs, MbCD and HPbCD, prevented the venom from killing the human myeloid cells and rupturing mouse red blood cells in a well-plate for up to 15 minutes after exposure, Neely says. The team then gave HPbCD, considered safe for humans, to mice that had been injected with C. fleckeri venom. For 15 minutes, the drug blocked pain, tissue death, and scarring., Neely says he was surprised that he and his colleagues could block the venom’s action with a single drug, given that the venom itself is composed of more than 250 proteins. “It’s kind of lucky that it worked out.” The researchers hypothesize that because HPbCD works by pulling cholesterol out of the cell membrane, jellyfish venom may rely on cholesterol to gain an entryway into the cell. However, Neely says, MbCD may also act directly on the venom to neutralize it., Yanagihara, who has developed a topical cream to help treat box jellyfish stings, says she’s skeptical that the cholesterol drug treatment will be sufficient by itself, because it has so far only been used against processed venom—not stings from live animals, thought to be more potent. “The next step would be to ground truth these findings by live tentacle sting tests on live animals.”, Neely says that because their venom caused all the symptoms of a typical sting in the mice, he believes the results will translate to the real world. And he’s already looking forward to the next step: testing whether the cholesterol drugs protect the heart in live animals. Eventually, he hopes to bring the potential antidote to human clinical trials., If those should work, the antidote has much promise, says Cheryl Ames, a marine biologist from the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the study. “It’s very cool stuff, [and] I’m pumped.”",

        "abstract": "Marchers flooded the streets of Buenos Aires today to protest President Mauricio Macri’s austerity measures., By Lindzi WesselApr. 30, 2019 , 4:00 PM, Scientists from labs across Argentina stayed home today, joining a nationwide strike against the government’s latest round of austerity measures. One of their key rallying points: a call to restore lost opportunities for young researchers who began their education during a time of high investment in science but now have little hope of continuing their careers in Argentina., Schools, public transportation systems, and university offices shut down as their employees joined the strike, making it difficult to say exactly how many researchers were absent as part of the national movement. But research institute heads estimated thousands were on strike., Since coming to power in 2015, President Mauricio Macri’s administration has cut short efforts by his predecessors to grow the scientific community. In the latest blow, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), headquartered in Buenos Aires, announced on 5 April that it had a mere 450 new first-time investigator positions available for this year’s roughly 2600 Ph.D. graduates and former postdocs—leaving a record number of trainees without jobs. The previous government had projected that about 1400 new jobs would now be available., Without a position with CONICET, which employs more than 20,000 researchers in hundreds of centers throughout the country, young scientists have few opportunities. And the salaries of those lucky enough to get a job this year will be worth roughly half as much as they were in 2015, because of a failure to raise research salaries in step with rapid inflation., CONICET institute directors themselves are fighting the cuts. On 12 April, 140 of them paid their own way to the city of Córdoba for an emergency meeting, in some cases despite phone calls from CONICET authorities discouraging participation, according to two attendees who requested anonymity. “This is a very brand-new forum,” says biological anthropologist Rolando González-José, an institute head at the National Patagonian Center (CENPAT) in Puerto Madryn. “The number of directors attending was significant evidence of the crisis we are facing right now.” (CONICET did not respond to emails from Science.), The meeting resulted in a manifesto demanding “the immediate implementation of a plan to rescue CONICET,” including a scholarship extension for the trainees who missed out on a job and are now scrambling for other opportunities. It also called for an emergency budget increase for CONICET and reinstitution of the nation’s science ministry, which downgraded to a subsection of the Ministry of Education last year. The group has yet to receive a response from the government., The plight of science reflects a broad economic crisis in Argentina, where massive inflation and a slipping peso have also forced other government agencies and private businesses to tighten their belts. The nation recently received a bailout package of more than $57 billion from the International Monetary Fund—the largest ever in the fund’s history—that comes with stiff requirements, including a commitment to cut the deficit to zero this year., The impact on science has already been dramatic. Investment in R&D was just 0.26% of gross domestic product in 2018, down from 0.53% just 3 years earlier. Many CONICET institutes have cut back on such basic needs as cleaning and security services, as well as on research operations. The Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physicochemistry Research in La Plata, for instance, can no longer supply its labs with critical resources such as liquid nitrogen and oxygen tanks. At CENPAT, field research vans that encounter mechanical issues must simply be retired; there’s no money for maintenance. The peso’s drop has made imported equipment and reagents virtually unaffordable. “You think 100 times before running an experiment and you pray it won’t fail,” says Juan Pablo Jaworski, a CONICET virologist at the National Institute of Agricultural Technology., To make matters worse, funding promised for some facilities is overdue, with no word on when or whether it will arrive. By the end of 2018, only 40% of 2017 funds had made it into the hands of institute directors. So far, this year’s funding has hovered around only half that amount., The dismal job prospects for young researchers are bound to accelerate Argentina’s brain drain, says Alberto Kornblihtt, head of CONICET’s Institute of Physiology, Molecular Biology, and Neurosciences. Kornblihtt recently saw two junior principal investigators leave his institute to find labs abroad after struggling to make ends meet for a year and not seeing much hope for improvement. “We can’t just say you don’t have any place in this country, go abroad,” he says. “We have to stop the brain drain and keep the system alive.”, The protests will continue. CONICET directors are planning their own push for public support at a 22 May national cabildo abierto, or open council, a form of protest structured around the public debate. Yet González-José can’t help but feel pessimistic, because the scientific community has been ignored before. The resistance is getting stronger, he concedes, but “the resistance is getting stronger because the problems are getting worse.”",

It's easy to rip tissue on the way in. And once in place, a probe can do further damage that muffles the signals it aims to detect. But recent reports describe a generation of finer probes that should prove less damaging. Just a few micrometers thick—comparable to neurons themselves—these tools may soon capture unprecedented long-term recordings from hard-to-reach parts of animal brains. And they may lead to more sophisticated brain-computer interfaces for people., Improved material fabrication techniques have helped labs create the exquisitely fine probes, says neural engineer Timothy Hanson, who developed a system for inserting tiny electrodes while at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). And lab tests have shown that brain research using ultrasmall electrodes \"can be done, and that it's worthwhile.\", Conventional brain probes are already vanishingly tiny. Stiff electrodes known as Michigan probes, commonly used in neuroscience research, are pointed, ribbonlike shafts that can be as thin as 15 micrometers and are usually 60 micrometers wide or more. In a standard grid known as the Utah array, each spike is roughly 200 micrometers thick at its base. But in the months after either device is implanted, its connection to neurons typically weakens and its signal fades., A key reason is that the probe provokes an immune reaction in the brain. Its initial plunge into the tissue can tear blood vessels. And even after that damage heals, the probe continues to push and pull on surrounding tissue. In response, nonneuronal cells called glia multiply and form scars that push neurons away from the electrode., Damage also limits the number of electrodes a brain can host, says Cynthia Chestek, a neural engineer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. To get valid data, \"We need animals that act normally after they get these implants.\" Introduce too many probes and \"you're studying traumatic brain injury.\" The constraint on probe number also limits the performance of brain-machine interfaces such as the robotic limb control systems her group is developing; fine motor skills will require more recording channels, Chestek says. So her team is developing much smaller electrodes using rigid carbon fibers roughly 8 micrometers in diameter. These fibers have been shown to record from individual neurons in a rat's brain for several months with no significant glial scarring or neuron death., Other groups are betting on a different class of material: strong polymers that bend when extremely thin. \"The surrounding neurons see the probes, mechanically, as their peers,\" says Chong Xie, a neural engineer at the University of Texas in Austin. His group showed in 2017 that 1-micrometer-thick polymer probes produced no scarring in mouse brains over 4 months; recent results extend longevity past a year, he says., Several new probes under development are similar in thickness to some axons, neurons' signal-carrying extensions., Harvard University chemist Charles Lieber has moved even closer to the neuron scale by building electrodes less than a micrometer thick and as flexible as neurons' axons, or projections. In Nature Materials in February, Lieber's team showed the probes' seamless integration in the mouse brain with fluourescence imaging. The team recorded from the same set of cells with no loss of signal or immune response for 3 months., With their ultrafine probes, Lieber's and Xie's groups have recorded for months from the rodent hippocampus, a deep structure involved in learning and memory. Conventional electrodes can't listen in on individual hippocampal neurons for long, Xie says. Researchers typically advance their probes a few micrometers farther every day to capture signals from a new set of cells as their previous targets get damaged or pushed away. By sticking with the same set of neurons for long periods, the new probes could help resolve how the roles of individual neurons evolve in response to animals' experiences., Because polymer probes are so flexible, driving them into the brain is challenging. Lieber's team loads its neuronlike strands into a syringe and uses a rigid 400-micrometer-wide needle to deliver the electrodes to precise spots. In a March preprint, Hanson and colleagues at UCSF described a neural \"sewing machine,\" in which a robotic arm swiftly punctures the brain with a metal needle to push in soft probes. And neural engineer Nicholas Melosh and his team at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, attach a stiff wire to bundles of their 7-by-1.5-micrometer polymer probes, which peel off as the wire descends into the brain., Last month at a meeting of the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative in Washington, D.C., Melosh presented vivid evidence that smaller probes really are gentler. His group made precise recordings of the minute forces that probes ranging in diameter from 13 to 200 micrometers exerted as they penetrated a living mouse brain. At probe sizes 25 micrometers and below, microscopy showed virtually no tearing of blood vessels. Instead of puncturing capillaries, these smaller wires pushed them aside., That finding is \"really, really good news\" for ultrasmall electrodes under development, Chestek says., Neuron-scale probes still have to fully demonstrate their longevity and prove they can get good signals in larger animals. But the early signs of safety are encouraging, Chestek says. She points to videos Melosh shared of massive, spreading bleeds from the poke of an 80-micrometer probe. \"We used to think 80 microns was small.\"",

        "abstract": "Kelvin Droegemeier in his office next to the White House, By Jeffrey MervisMay. 1, 2019 , 12:55 PM, U.S. academic scientists and university officials have long complained about how much time they must spend complying with the many rules relating to the federal dollars they receive. But since President Donald Trump assumed office, most scientists have refocused their angst on the president’s proposed large spending cuts to basic research and his administration’s seeming indifference to combatting climate change. What is known as the administrative burden issue has largely fallen off their radar, in large part because they fear that any changes by the Trump administration might make matters worse rather than better., Kelvin Droegemeier wants to turn back the clock. As director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the president’s science adviser, Droegemeier generally avoids the subject of federal budgets and climate change when talking to researchers. Science lobbyists say his silence is understandable, given the slim chance that his advice would alter the administration’s stance on those issues., Instead, Droegemeier prefers to discuss how he wants to “unleash scientists” and remove obstacles to their greater productivity—especially bureaucratic red tape. “This thing has been studied to death. Now it’s time to take action,” he said yesterday during a meeting with a panel of space scientists and aerospace engineers convened by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in Washington, D.C. “I am absolutely intent on moving the needle. In fact, I’m almost angry.”, That’s strong language from the normally mild-mannered Droegemeier. But it’s become part of his stump speech since becoming OSTP director in January. And he’s likely to repeat that message tomorrow at the annual Forum on Science and Technology Policy in Washington, D.C., put on by AAAS (publisher of ScienceInsider)., Railing against the administrative burden on the U.S. research community resonates with his audiences. A federal survey has consistently found that scientists say they spend more than 40% of the time they allocate to a federal grant on activities other than actual research—a list that includes mentoring students and writing papers. Although Droemegeier acknowledges that some of those activities are necessary and even important, he says others “are not valuable and serve no useful purpose. I can’t think of anything more wasteful” of the time and energy of brilliant, highly trained scientists, he adds., But his forceful language turns mushy when Droegemeier is asked how he would eliminate wasteful practices. In 2016, Congress passed a law that told the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to set up an advisory board, called the Research Policy Board, to tackle the issue. But Trump budget officials have balked at setting up the board, saying lawmakers first need to change how the National Institutes of Health reimburses universities for the money they spend on infrastructure and overhead related to federal grants. OMB says those changes would free up money for more spending on biomedical research. But Congress has prohibited the administration from reducing those payments, so efforts to establish the policy board are at an impasse., Speaking yesterday to ScienceInsider, Droegemeier said there’s another, faster way to address administrative burdens without creating the board. “There’s nothing that prohibits us from moving forward via the National Science and Technology Council [NSTC],” he says, referring to an existing White House body OSTP manages that has representatives from two dozen federal agencies. Using NSTC may even be preferable, he says, “given the slow pace of change” and the fact that U.S. voters will go to the polls again in November 2020., Droegemeier’s desire to “unleash the human mind” goes beyond simply reducing federal paperwork. He has repeatedly told scientific audiences that he would also like to see new forms of research collaborations among government agencies, universities, and corporations that wouldn’t be bound by existing rules., One approach, which he has labeled alpha institutes, “would bring together smart people and turn them loose,” he told the academies panel. “You don’t want them to violate any laws. But you’re basically saying to them, ‘We’ll unencumber you as much as possible. Instead of a report every quarter, you’ll make a two-page PowerPoint presentation once a year.’”, Droegemeier has been toying with the idea for a decade and admits that it still lacks important details, such as which federal rules might have to be waived or altered to allow them to exist. And there are other questions. “Who would choose the problem, and who would choose the people? Yeah, that’s all to be determined,” he says, along with how the institutes would be funded. “Some of them may fail. But that’s fine,” he adds. “The point is to send the message that our research enterprise is burdened with unnecessary regulations and that it’s time to fix this problem.”, A second promising approach, Droegemeier says, would be to expand the existing number of academic-industry partnerships, including having academic scientists remain as faculty members while also working for a company. “It’s not a completely foreign idea,” he says. “But we just don’t do it very often because of all the potential conflicts.”, Droegemeier thinks the scientific community has the power to remove that obstacle by thinking more boldly. “We end up not doing something not because it doesn’t make sense, but because it’s difficult,” he says. “We need to take intellectual risks, and we don’t do that as often as we used to.”, The odds that any of these reforms will come to pass under Droegemeier’s watch aren’t good, he admits. But he plans to give it a try for however long he remains in the White House., “We have 20 months [before Trump’s term ends], what can we accomplish?” he says. “I didn’t come to Washington just to keep the lights on.”",
