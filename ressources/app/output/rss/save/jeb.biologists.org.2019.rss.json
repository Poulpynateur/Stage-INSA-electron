[{"abstract":"The hypothalamus controls metabolism and feeding behavior via several signals with other tissues. Exercise and supplements can change hypothalamic signaling pathways, so the present study investigated the influence of eccentric resistance training and β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate free acid supplement on PGC-1α expression, serum irisin, nesfatin-1 and resistin concentrations. Thirty-two male rats (8 weeks old, 200±17 g body mass) were randomized to control (CON), β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate free acid (HMB) supplementation, eccentric resistance training (ERT), and β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate free acid supplementation plus eccentric resistance training (HMB+ERT) groups. Training groups undertook eccentric resistance training (6 weeks, 3 times a week) and supplement groups consumed HMB-FA orally (76 mg/kg/day). Twenty-four hours after the last training session, rats were sacrificed after which serum and triceps brachii muscle were collected and sent to the laboratory for analyses. Two-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation were employed (significant level: P< 0.05). The results showed that eccentric resistance training increases skeletal muscle PGC-1α gene expression, as well as serum levels of irisin and nesfatin-1 (P= 0.001). Eccentric resistance training decreases serum concentration of resistin (P= 0.001). HMB-FA supplement increases skeletal muscle PGC-1α gene expression (P= 0.002), as well as serum concentartion of irisin and nesfatin-1 (P= 0.001). HMB-FA decreases the serum concentration of resistin (P= 0.001). Significant correlations were observed between PGC-1α gene expression and serum concentrations of irisin, nesfatin-1 and resistin. Generally, HMB-FA with eccentric resistance training may induce crosstalk between releasing peptides from other tissues and increases maximal strength. Their combination had a more substantial effect than each intervention in isolation.","keywords":"Exercise, HMB supplement, Maximal strength, PGC-1α signaling pathway, Resistance training, Tissue crosstalk","title":"Eccentric resistance training and β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate free acid affects muscle PGC-1α expression and serum irisin, nesfatin-1 and resistin","authors":"Hossein Shirvani, Saleh Rahmati-Ahmadabad, David Robert Broom, Reza Mirnejad","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"13 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.198424v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Biologists commonly visualize different features of an organism using distinct sources of illumination.

We address this challenge with the technique of Multichannel Stroboscopic Videography (MSV), which synchronizes multiple strobe lights with video exposures of a single camera. We illustrate the utility of this approach with kinematic measurements of a walking cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and calculations of the pressure field around a swimming fish (Danio rerio). In both, transmitted illumination generated high-contrast images of the animal's body in one channel.

This study investigated how goats adjust the stiffness of their hindlimbs to accommodate surfaces of different stiffness. Goats provide a compelling animal model for studying leg stiffness modulation, because they skillfully ambulate over a range of substrates that vary in compliance. To investigate the adjustments that goats make when walking over such substrates, ground reaction forces and three-dimensional trajectories of hindlimb markers were recorded as goats walked on rigid, rubber, and foam surfaces. Net joint moments, powers, and work at the hip, knee, ankle and metatarsophalangeal joints were estimated throughout stance via inverse dynamics. Hindlimb stiffness was estimated from plots of total leg force versus total leg length, and individual joint stiffnesses were estimated from plots of joint moment versus joint angle. Our results support the hypothesis that goats modulate hindlimb stiffness in response to surface stiffness; specifically, hindlimb stiffness decreased on the more compliant surfaces (p<0.002). Estimates of joint stiffness identified hip and ankle muscles as the primary drivers of these adjustments. When humans run on compliant surfaces, they generally increase leg stiffness to preserve their center-of-mass mechanics. We did not estimate center-of-mass mechanics in this study; nevertheless, our estimates of hindlimb stiffness suggest that goats exhibit a different behavior. This study offers new insight into mechanisms that allow quadrupeds to modulate their gait mechanics when walking on surfaces of variable compliance.","keywords":"Locomotion, Quadruped, Biomechanics, Inverse dynamics, Leg stiffness, Joint stiffness","title":"Goats decrease hindlimb stiffness when walking over compliant surfaces","authors":"Tyler R.

Food-derived odorants are generally involved in mediating long-and short-range attraction. Taste cues, on the other hand, act directly by contact with the food source, promoting the ingestion of nutritious food and the avoidance of toxic substances. It is possible, however, that insects integrate information from these sensory modalities during the process of feeding itself. Here, using a simple feeding assay, we investigated whether odors modulate food consumption in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We found that the presence of both single food-derived odorants and complex odor mixtures enhanced consumption of an appetitive food. Feeding enhancement depended on the concentration and the chemical identity of the odorant. Volatile cues alone were sufficient to mediate this effect, as feeding was also increased when animals were prevented from contacting the odor source. Both males and females, including virgin females, increased ingestion in the presence of food-derived volatiles. Moreover, the presence of food-derived odorants significantly increased the consumption of food mixtures containing aversive bitter compounds, suggesting that flies integrate diverse olfactory and gustatory cues to guide feeding decisions, including in situations in which animals are confronted with stimuli of opposite valence. Overall, these results show that food-derived olfactory cues directly modulate feeding in D. melanogaster, enhancing ingestion.","keywords":"Olfaction, Feeding, Fruit fly, Sensory integration, Taste, Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila melanogaster","title":"Food-derived volatiles enhance consumption in Drosophila melanogaster","authors":"Carolina E.

However, wing gaps inherent of this process can also reduce flight capacities, which could be detrimental when foraging or escaping predators. Still, many bird species will not stop their normal activities when molting. In this study, we investigated whether and how birds adjust their escape flight behavior to compensate for the reduction in performance when flying with wing gaps. Using stereoscopic high-speed videography, we filmed 146 upward-directed escape flights of 19 and 22 pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) with and without simulated molt gaps, respectively. We then reconstructed the three-dimensional body and wing movements throughout each maneuver. By comparing flights with and without gaps, we determined how wing molt gaps affected wing morphology, escape flight performance, and how the birds adjusted their flight kinematics in order to negate possible negative aerodynamic effects. Our manipulations resulted in a lower second-moment-of-area of the wings, but flight speed and net aerodynamic force production did not differ between the two groups. We found that in manipulated birds, the size of the gap was reduced as the flight feathers adjacent to the gap had moved towards each other. Moreover, the experimental decrease in second-moment-of-area was associated with an increase in angle-of-attack, whereas changes in wingbeat-induced speeds were associated with variations in aerodynamic force production. This suggests that the control of escape flight in molting birds might be modular, allowing relatively simple flight control, thus reducing the burden on the neuro-muscular flight control system.","keywords":"European pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, Ficedula hypoleuca, Avian flight, Wingbeat kinematics","title":"A songbird compensates for wing molt during escape flights by reducing the molt gap and increasing angle-of-attack","authors":"Barbara M.

The command for each EOD arises from a medullary pacemaker nucleus composed by electrotonically coupled intrinsic pacemaker and bulbospinal projecting relay cells. During agonistic encounters Gymnotus omarorum signals submission by interrupting its EOD (offs) and by emitting transient high rate barrages of low amplitude discharges (chirps). Previous studies in gymnotiformes have shown that electric signal diversity is based on the segregation of descending synaptic inputs to pacemaker or relay cells and differential activation of the neurotransmitter receptors -for glutamate or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- of these cells. Therefore, we tested whether GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs to pacemaker nucleus neurons are involved in the emission of submissive electric signals in G. omarorum. We found that GABA applied to pacemaker cells evokes EOD interruptions that closely resembled natural offs. Although in other species chirping is likely due to glutamatergic suprathreshold depolarization of relay cells, here, application of glutamate to these cells was unable to replicate the emission of this submissive signal. Nevertheless, chirp-like discharges were emitted after the enhancement of excitability of relay cells by blocking an IA-type potassium current and, in some cases, by application of vasotocin, a status-dependent modulator peptide of G. omarorum agonistic behavior. Modulation of electrophysiological properties of pacemaker nucleus neurons in gymnotiformes emerges as a novel putative mechanism, endowing electromotor networks with higher functional versatility.","keywords":"Glutamate, GABA, Neuromodulation, Neuronal excitability, Electric fish, Pacemaker nucleus, Electric communication, Agonistic behavior, Social signals, Gymnotus omarorum, Gymnotus omarorum","title":"Distinctive mechanisms underlie the emission of social electric signals of submission in Gymnotus omarorum","authors":"Virginia Comas, Kim Langevin, Ana Silva, Michel Borde","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"13 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.195354v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Thermal performance curves (TPCs) are intended to approximate the relationship between temperature and fitness, and are commonly integrated into species distributional models for understanding climate change responses. However, TPCs may vary across traits because selection and environmental sensitivity (plasticity) differ across traits or because the timing and duration of the temperature exposure, here termed time-scale, may alter trait variation. Yet the extent to which TPCs vary temporally and across traits is rarely considered in assessments of climate change responses. Using a common garden approach, we estimate TPCs for standard metabolic rate (SMR), and activity in Drosophila melanogaster at three test temperatures (16, 25 and 30 °C), using flies from each of six developmental temperatures (16, 18, 20, 25, 28 and 30 °C). We examined the effects of time-scale of temperature exposure (mins/hours vs days/weeks) in altering the TPC shape, position and commonly used descriptors of the TPC- thermal optimum (TOPT), thermal limits (TMIN and TMAX) and thermal breadth (TBR). In addition we collated previously published estimates of TPCs for fecundity and egg-to-adult viability in D. melanogaster. We found that the descriptors of the TPCs varied across traits (egg-to-adult viability, SMR, activity and fecundity), but variation in TPCs within these traits was small across studies when measured at the same time-scales. The time-scale at which traits were measured contributed to greater variation in TPCs than the observed variance across traits, although the relative importance of time-scale differed depending on the trait (activity vs fecundity). Variation in the TPC across traits and time-scales suggests that TPCs using single traits may not be an accurate predictor of fitness and thermal adaptation across environments.","keywords":"Thermal performance curve, Metabolic rate, Activity, Fecundity, Egg-to-adult viability, Plasticity","title":"Comparing thermal performance curves across traits: how consistent are they?","authors":"Vanessa Kellermann, Steven L.

This study aimed to evaluate the cardiac expression of SELENOT, and the effects of exogenous PSELT (a 43-52 SELENOT derived-peptide) on the heart function of C. auratus, a hypoxia tolerance fish model. We found that SELENOT was expressed in cardiac extracts of juvenile and adult fish, located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) together with calsequestrin-2. Expression increased under acute hypoxia. On ex vivo isolated and perfused goldfish heart preparations, under normoxia, PSELT dose-dependently increased Stroke Volume (SV), Cardiac Output (Q̇), and Stroke Work (SW), by involving cAMP, PKA, L-type calcium channels, SERCA2a pumps, and pAkt. Under hypoxia, PSELT did not affect myocardial contractility. Only at higher concentrations (10−8 -10−7 M) an increase of SV and Q̇ was observed. It also reduced the cardiac expression of 3-NT, a tissue marker of nitrosative stress which increases under low oxygen availability.

Here, we explore the navigational knowledge of the nocturnal bull ant, Myrmecia midas, by investigating differences in nest-ward homing after displacement of three forager groups based on similarities in the panoramas between the release site and previously visited locations. Foragers that travel straight up the foraging tree or to close trees around the nest show reduced navigational success in orienting and returning from displacements compared to individuals that forage further from the nest site. By analysing the cues present in the panorama, we show that multiple metrics of forager navigational performance correspond with the degree of similarity between the release site panorama and panoramas of previously visited sites.

Corticosteroid receptor (CR) pharmacological blocker studies have suggested that to produce this tightening effect, cortisol acts on the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) as well as glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). This study considered how cortisol influenced model gill epithelium permeability and TJ properties by transcriptional knockdown of the gene encoding MR (mr-KD) using double-stranded RNA. Following mr-KD a significant reduction in MR protein abundance was observed in the epithelium. The mr-KD epithelium demonstrated reduced transepithelial resistance (TER) and increased the paracellular flux of [3H] polyethylene glycol (MW 400 kDa, PEG-400). Concurrently, mRNA abundance of gr2 and 11βhsd increased, indicating a possible compensatory response to mr-KD. Transcript abundance of claudin (cldn) -6, -8d, 23a and -28b decreased while cldn-20a increased in mr-KD preparations. Cortisol-induced epithelial tightening was enhanced in mr-KD preparations, suggesting that alterations in CRs and TJ composition augmented model epithelium barrier function in response to lowered MR abundance. Cortisol treatment significantly increased the transcript and protein abundance of TJ proteins such as cldn/Cldn -8d, and -28b. However, in mr-KD preparations, Cldn-28b protein abundance did not significantly alter in response to cortisol treatment, while Cldn-8d significantly elevated. Data suggest that mr-KD compromises normal barrier function of a primary cultured rainbow trout gill epithelium both in the presence and absence of cortisol and that Cldn-28b protein abundance may be modulated by cortisol via the MR only.","keywords":"Tight junction, Paracellular permeability, Cortisol, Mineralocorticoid receptor, Osmoregulation, Knockdown","title":"The mineralocorticoid receptor contributes to barrier function of a model fish gill epithelium","authors":"Dennis Kolosov, Scott P.

We, therefore, investigated how developmental temperature affects reproductive performance (early fecundity and egg-to-adult viability) of wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster. We have tested competing hypotheses on the character of developmental thermal plasticity using a full factorial design with three developmental and adulthood temperatures within the natural thermal range of this species. To account for potential intraspecific differences, we examined flies from tropical (India) and temperate (Slovakia) climate zones. Our results show that flies from both populations raised at intermediate developmental temperature (25°C) have comparable or higher early fecundity and fertility at all tested adulthood temperatures, while lower (17°C) or higher developmental temperatures (29°C) did not entail any advantage under the tested thermal regimes. Importantly, the superior thermal performance of flies raised at 25°C is apparent even after taking two traits positively associated with reproductive output into account – body size and ovariole number. Thus, in Drosophila melanogaster, development at a given temperature does not necessarily provide any advantage at this thermal environment in terms of reproductive fitness. Our findings strongly support the optimal developmental temperature hypothesis which claims that at different thermal environments the highest fitness is achieved when an organism is raised at its optimal developmental temperature.","keywords":"Developmental plasticity, Acclimation, Drosophila, Drosophila, Fecundity, Viability, Ovariole number, Body size","title":"Reproductive fitness of Drosophila is maximised by optimal developmental temperature","authors":"Peter Klepsatel, Thirnahalli Nagaraj Girish, Heinrich Dircksen, Martina Gáliková","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"7 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.202184v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"The elastic tendinous tissues of distal lower limb muscles can improve the economy of walking and running, amplify the power generated by a muscle as well as absorb energy.

Simultaneous measurements of ultrasound, surface electromyography and 3-dimensional motion capture with musculoskeletal modelling from twelve healthy participants were recorded as they walked at preferred and fast walking speeds. We quantified the length changes and velocities of the TA muscle-tendon unit and its fascicles across the stride at each speed. Fascicle length changes and velocities were relatively consistent across speeds, although the magnitude of fascicle length change differed between the deep and superficial regions. At contact, when the TA is actively generating force, the fascicles remained relatively isometric as the MTU actively lengthened, presumably stretching the TA tendinous tissue and absorbing energy. This potentially protects the muscle fibres from damage during weight acceptance and allows energy to be returned to the system later in the stride. During early swing the fascicles and MTU both actively shortened to dorsiflex the foot, clearing the toes from the ground; although, at the fast walking velocity the majority of the shortening occurred through tendinous tissue recoil, highlighting its role in accelerating ankle dorsi-flexion to power rapid foot clearance in swing.","keywords":"Tibialis anterior, Walking, Ultrasound, Energy absorption","title":"Tibialis anterior tendinous tissue plays a key role in energy absorption during human walking","authors":"Jayishni N.

MTs of caterpillars are notably complex and consist of several regions that display prominent differences in ion transport. The distal ileac plexus (DIP) is a region of Malpighian tubule that is of particular interest because it switches from ion secretion to ion reabsorption in larvae fed on ion-rich diets. The pathways of solute transport in the DIP are not well understood, but one potential route is the paracellular pathway between epithelial cells. This pathway is regulated by the septate junctions (SJs) in invertebrates, and in this study, we found regional and cellular heterogeneity in expression of several integral SJ proteins. DIP of larvae fed ion-rich diets demonstrated a reduction in paracellular permeability, coupled with alterations in both SJ morphology and the abundance of its molecular components. Similarly, treatment in vitro with helicokinin (HK), an antidiuretic hormone identified by previous studies, altered mRNA abundance of many SJ proteins and reduced paracellular permeability. HK was also shown to target a secondary cell-specific SJ protein Tsp2A. Taken together, our data suggest that dietary ion loading, known to cause ion transport reversal in the DIP of larval T. ni, leads to alterations in the paracellular permeability, SJ morphology and its molecular component abundance. The results suggest that HK is an important endocrine factor that co-regulates ion transport, water transport and paracellular permeability in MTs of larval lepidopterans. We propose that co-regulation of all three components of the MT function in larval lepidopterans allows for safe toggling between ion secretion and reabsorption in the DIP in response to variations in dietary ion availability.","keywords":"Septate junctions, Malpighian tubules, Lepidoptera, Ion transport reversal, Paracellular permeability","title":"Septate junction in the distal ileac plexus of larval lepidopteran Trichoplusia ni: alterations in paracellular permeability during ion transport reversal","authors":"Dennis Kolosov, Sima Jonusaite, Andrew Donini, Scott P.

Natural selection predicts the attachment ability to scale positively with load, and hence body size, and so be larger in females than males. Sexual selection predicts attachment forces in males to be larger than females, despite the males’ smaller size because males benefit from uninterrupted copulation by stronger attachment to the female. We tested these predictions in the common bedbug Cimex lectularius, a species in which both sexes, as well as nymphs, regularly carry large loads, blood meals of up to three times the body weight. By measuring attachment forces to smooth surfaces and analysing in-situ fixed copulating pairs and the morphology of attachment devices, we show i) that males generate twice the attachment force of females, although weighing 15 % less, ii) that males adhere to females during copulation using hairy tibial adhesive pads, iii) more setae, and more setae per unit area, in the pads of males than females but no difference in shape of tarsal setae, and iv) the absence of hairy tibial attachment pads and low attachment force in nymphs. These results are consistent with a sexually selected function of attachment in bedbugs. Controlling sperm transfer and mate guarding by attaching to females during copulation may also shape the evolution of male attachment structures in other species. More generally, we hypothesise the existence of arms races of male attachment structures and female counterparts to impede attachment which may result in a similar evolutionary diversification as male genitalia.","keywords":"Adhesive setae, Centrifugal force test, Fossulae spongiosa, Resilin, Safety factor, Sexual conflict, Tibial setae","title":"Evidence for a sexually selected function of the attachment system in bedbugs Cimex lectularius (Heteroptera, Cimicidae)","authors":"Klaus Reinhardt, Dagmar Voigt, Stanislav N.

One of the driving forces responsible for alterations in brain morphology is increasing environmental complexity that may demand for enhanced cognitive abilities (e.g. attention, memory and learning). However, studies looking at the relationship between brain morphology and learning are scarce. Here, we tested the effects of both learning and environmental enrichment on neural plasticity in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), by means of either a reversal-learning test or a spatial-learning test. Given considerable evidence supporting environmentally-induced plastic alterations, two separate control groups that were not subjected to any cognitive test were included to account for potential changes induced by the experimental setup alone. We did not find any effect of learning on any of our brain measurements. However, we found strong evidence for an environmental effect, where fish given access to the spatial-learning environment had larger relative brain size and optic tectum size in relation to those exposed to the reversal-learning environment. Our results demonstrate the plasticity of the adult brain to respond adaptively mainly to environmental conditions, providing support for the environmental enhancement theory.","keywords":"Brain plasticity, Cognition, Reversal learning, Spatial learning","title":"Plastic changes in brain morphology in relation to learning and environmental enrichment in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata)","authors":"Stephanie Fong, Séverine D.

The results showed that frequent induction of stress responses by ACTH injections, independently of parental care, adversely affected offspring final body size, wing length and baseline corticosterone levels. Nestling behavioural activity did not differ between ACTH- and saline-treated groups during exposure to control sounds while behavioural activity during exposure to alarm calls was reduced in manipulated offspring only.

Infection by S. carpocapsae significantly up-regulated Vg mRNA expression in the male body. The corresponding increase in Vg protein expression was also confirmed by electrophoretic and immunoblotting analyses. Remarkably, in females, the tendency was opposite. Nematodal infection significantly reduced both Vg mRNA and Vg protein expression levels in fat body and hemolymph, respectively. We speculate that infection of reproductive females reduces Vg expression to the level, which is still sufficient for defense, but insufficient for reproduction. This circumstance reduces energy expenditure and helps the individual to cope with the infection. Importantly, purified Vg significantly inhibited growth of Xenorhabdus spp., an entomotoxic bacteria isolated from S. carpocapsae. However, the effect of Vg against I. fumosorosea was not so obvious. The fungus significantly stimulated Vg gene expression in males, however, a similar increase was not recapitulated on the protein level. Nevertheless, in females, both mRNA and protein Vg levels were significantly reduced after the fungal infection. The obtained data demonstrate that Vg is likely an important defense protein, possibly with a specific activity. This considerably expands the known spectrum of Vg functions, as its primary role was thought to be limited to regulating egg development in the female body.","keywords":"Insect, Vitellogenin, Infection, Entomopathogenic nematode, Entomopathogenic fungus, Antimicrobial activity","title":"Changes in vitellogenin expression caused by nematodal and fungal infections in insects","authors":"Dalibor Kodrík, Emad Ibrahim, Umesh K.

Thus, we hypothesized that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development induces morphological changes that remain after hatching. To test this hypothesis, chicken embryos were incubated entirely (21 days) under normoxia or partially under hypoxia (15% O2 during days 12 to 18). Lung structures, including air capillaries, blood capillaries, infundibula, atria, parabronchial lumen, bronchi, blood vessels larger than capillaries (Bv) and interparabronchial tissue (It), in 1- and 10-day-old chicks were analyzed using light microscopy-assisted stereology. Tissue barrier and surface area of air capillaries were measured using electron microscopy-assisted stereology, allowing for calculation of the anatomical diffusion factor. Hypoxia increased the relative volumes of air and blood capillaries, structures directly involved in gas exchange, while decreased the relative volumes of atria in both groups of chicks, and the parabronchial lumen in older chicks. Accordingly, the surface area of the air capillaries and the anatomical diffusion factor were increased under hypoxic incubation. Treatment did not alter total lung volume, relative volumes of infundibula, bronchi, Bv, It, or the tissue barrier of any group. We conclude that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development lead to a morphological remodeling, characterized by increased volume density and respiratory surface area of structures involved in gas exchange at the expense of structures responsible for air conduction in chicks up to 10 days old.","keywords":"Incubation, Blood capillary, Air capillary, Lung, Blood-gas tissue barrier, Chicken","title":"Parabronchial remodeling in chicks in response to embryonic hypoxia","authors":"Lara do Amaral-Silva, Markus Lambertz, Fernando José Zara, Wilfried Klein, Luciane Helena Gargaglioni, Kênia Cardoso Bícego","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"26 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.197970v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Unlike vertebrates, the penaeid shrimp stomach is of ectodermic origin and is thus covered by a cuticle that is sloughed upon molting. It is composed of two chambers, here called the anterior and posterior stomach chambers, ASC and PSC respectively. The PSC contains a filtration structure variously called a pyloric filter, filter press, gastric filter or gastric sieve (GS) and the latter will be used here. The GS resembles an elongated, inverted-V, dome-like, chitinous structure with a midline ridge that is integral to the ventral base of the PSC. The dome surface is covered with a carpet-like layer of minute, comb-like setae bearing laterally-branching setulae. This carpet serves as a selective filter that excludes large partially-digested food particles but allows smaller particles and soluble materials to enter hepatopancreatic ducts that conduct them into the shrimp hepatopancreas (HP) where further digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place. Although the GS function is well known, its exclusion limit for particulate material has not been clearly defined. Using histological and ultra-structure analysis, we show that the GS sieve pore diameter is approximately 0.2-0.7 μm in size, indicating a size exclusion limit (SEL) of substantially less than 1 μm. Using fluorescent microbeads we show that particles of 1 μm diameter could not pass the GS but that those 0.1 μm diameter did pass through to accumulate in longitudinal grooves and move onto the HP where some were internalized by tubule epithelial cells. We found no significant differences in these sizes between the species Penaeus monodon and Penaeus vannamei or between juveniles and adults in P. vannamei.

Fatty acid desaturases, enzymes introducing double bonds into fatty acids, are crucial for the biosynthesis of these chemical signals. Δ12-desaturases catalyse the biosynthesis of linoleic acid by introducing a second double bond into oleic acid, but have been identified in only few animal species. Here we report the functional characterisation of two Δ12- desaturases, Nvit_D12a and Nvit_D12b, from the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis (Walker). We demonstrate that Nvit_D12a is expressed in the rectal vesicle of males where they produce a linoleic acid-derived sex pheromone to attract virgin females. 13C-labelling experiments with Urolepis rufipes (Ashmead), a closely related species belonging to the so-called “Nasonia-group”, revealed that females but not males are able to synthesise linoleic acid. U. rufipes males produce an isoprenoid sex pheromone in the same gland and do not depend on linoleic acid for pheromone production. This suggests that Δ12-desaturases, while common in the “Nasonia group”, acquired a specialised function in chemical communication of those species that use linoleic acid as a pheromone precursor. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that insect Δ12-desaturases have evolved repeatedly from Δ9-desaturases in different insect taxa. Hence, insects have developed a way to produce linoleic acid independent of the “Omega”-desaturase subfamily which harbours the eukaryotic Δ12-desaturases known so far.","keywords":"Parasitic wasp, Δ12-desaturase, Sex pheromone, Biosynthesis, Nasonia vitripennis, Nasonia vitripennis, Urolepis rufipes, Urolepis rufipes","title":"Functional characterisation of two Δ12-desaturases demonstrates targeted production of linoleic acid as pheromone precursor in Nasonia","authors":"Florian Semmelmann, Naoki Kabeya, Miriama Malcicka, Astrid Bruckmann, Bastian Broschwitz, Kristina Straub, Rainer Merkl, Oscar Monroig, Reinhard Sterner, Joachim Ruther, Jacintha Ellers","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"24 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.201038v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Humans have evolved the ability to walk very efficiently. Further, humans prefer to walk at speeds that approximately minimize their metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance (i.e. gross cost of transport, COT). This has been found in a variety of population groups and other species. However, these studies were mostly performed on smooth, level ground or on treadmills. We hypothesized that the objective function for walking is more complex than only minimizing the COT. To test this idea, we compared the preferred speeds and the relationships between COT and speed for people walking on both a smooth, level floor and a rough, natural terrain trail. Rough terrain presumably introduces other factors, such as stability, to the objective function. Ten healthy men walked on both a straight, flat, smooth floor and an outdoor trail strewn with rocks and boulders. In both locations, subjects performed five to seven trials at different speeds relative to their preferred speed. The COT–speed relationships were similarly U-shaped for both surfaces, but the COT values on rough terrain were approximately 115% greater. On the smooth surface, the preferred speed (1.24±0.17 m s−1) was not found to be statistically different (P=0.09) than the speed that minimized COT (1.34±0.03 m s−1). On rough terrain, the preferred speed (1.07±0.05 m s−1) was significantly slower than the COT minimum speed (1.13±0.07 m s−1; P=0.02). Because near the optimum speed the COT function is very shallow, these changes in speed result in a small change in COT (0.5%).

Egg maternal substances, however, can have interacting effects, but experimental studies of the consequences of the combined variation in the egg concentration of such molecules are extremely rare, particularly as far as prenatal stages are considered. We manipulated the yolk concentrations of vitamin E and corticosterone, which are the main antioxidants and, respectively, the main glucocorticoid hormone in bird eggs, both independently and simultaneously and we tested their separate and combined effects on growth and oxidative status in the liver and in the brain of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) embryos. Egg supplementation of relatively large, yet physiological doses of corticosterone depressed embryo growth (total body mass, tarsus length and liver mass) while administration of vitamin E in association with corticosterone restored normal growth. Vitamin E did not affect embryo growth when administered alone. We further analyzed independent and combined effects of vitamin E and corticosterone on liver and brain total antioxidant capacity, concentration of reactive oxygen molecules and lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E significantly reduced liver total antioxidant capacity, while corticosterone depressed brain lipid peroxidation. Prenatal exposure to vitamin E and corticosterone appears to have antagonistic effects on body growth, although vitamin E is not limiting in yellow-legged gull eggs. In combination with the results of previous experiments on the same species applying smaller experimental doses or focusing on the post-natal rather than pre-natal life stages, our findings indicate that the effects of a physiological increase in the egg concentrations of these substances can be life stage- and dose-specific, implying that generalizing prenatal effects of egg compounds may not be feasible.","keywords":"Corticosterone, Embryo growth, Yellow-legged gull, Oxidative status, Vitamin E","title":"Prenatal independent and combined effects of yolk vitamin E and corticosterone on embryo growth and oxidative status in the yellow-legged gull","authors":"Marco Parolini, Cristina Daniela Possenti, Simona Secomandi, Silvia Carboni, Manuela Caprioli, Diego Rubolini, Andrea Romano, Nicola Saino","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"1 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.199265v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/222/9/jeb192757/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>, Antarctica is almost the last place on Earth that you would expect to be teaming with life. Survival below zero should be impossible, especially for ectothermic creatures that depend on their environment for warmth. But for the enterprising icefishes, Antarctica represented bountiful evolutionary and ecological opportunities. The icefish lineage dominates the modern Southern Ocean and its members famously sport colourless blood, huge hearts and ample mitochondria, the cell's power packs. Charmed by these unusual fish, a multinational team led by H. William Detrich III of Northeastern University, USA, John H. Postlethwait of the University of Oregon, USA, and Hyun Park from the Korea Polar Research Institute and the University of Science and Technology, Korea, investigated the genetic building blocks of extreme evolutionary adaptation in icefish., A single adult Chaenocephalus aceratus, angled from the Antarctic Peninsula, provided the raw genetic material to sequence 30,773 protein-coding genes. When comparing the new genome with those of other bony fish, the researchers found 373 gene families that were larger than expected, and 346 gene families that looked too small, revealing icefish-specific genetic quirks. Nearly 40% of these quirks appeared within the last 7 million years, coinciding with plummeting temperatures and rising oxygen levels in the ocean surrounding Antarctica. How did these 719 gene families relate to adaptation to the world's coldest marine environment?, Antifreeze glycoproteins prevent ice crystals from expanding and tearing tissues. Unsurprisingly, icefish have a respectable 23 genes for antifreeze glycoproteins and their evolutionary precursors, trypsinogen and trypsinogen-like proteases. Yet strangely, icefish embryos do not express antifreeze glycoproteins, raising the question of how these animals develop at sub-zero temperatures. The authors hypothesized that embryos rely on other glycoproteins, such as those in the zona pellucida layer around their eggs, to fulfil the antifreeze role; and the genome supported their hunch. Icefish have 131 zona pellucida genes, far more than the 16 to 35 genes found in other fishes., Another piece of the icefish adaptation puzzle is their huge stock of mitochondria and polyunsaturated fats in their muscles, to counteract the effects of cold on the fish's metabolism and biological membranes. Mitochondria naturally produce small amounts of toxic molecules that can damage DNA, fats and other cell components. The high mitochondria and polyunsaturated fat content of icefish tissues makes them extra sensitive to oxidative stress, and this shows in their genes. Icefish expanded the gene families that prevent oxidative damage, including antioxidant proteins superoxide dismutase (icefish have three extra copies) and NAD(P)H-quinone dehydrogenase (there are 33 copies in icefish, compared with between 2 and 10 in other fish). Icefish are also the only vertebrates to double up on their 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase gene, which produces a protein that removes damaged pieces of DNA., Beyond the challenges of living in the cold, making their homes so far south means icefish experience the summer ‘midnight sun’ and prolonged winter darkness. Day length guides the rhythm and expression of hundreds of genes through the circadian clock pathways. How do icefish keep time when the sun is so unreliable? Their genome suggests that they simply don't bother. The icefish genome is missing many (though not all) of the time-keeping ‘period’ and cryptochrome genes found in other fish. Apparently, such extreme fluctuations in day length made light-dependent timekeeping less useful and the genes disappeared from the genome., Somehow, 10 to 14 million years ago, life found a way. Although we have known about the peculiarities of icefish since the earliest expeditions to the remote continent, we are just starting to understand the complex genetic machinery underlying their physiology. With over 30,000 genes to mine for interesting patterns, this new high-quality genome is only the tip of the iceberg in our understanding of adaptation to extreme environments.","keywords":"","title":"Genes of the world's coolest fish","authors":"Brittney G.

The natural patterning of the birds was used as the basis for phase correlation-based image matching, allowing indoor or outdoor use while being non-intrusive for the birds. The accuracy of the method was quantified and shown to be sufficient for characterising the geometric parameters of interest, but with a reduction in accuracy close to the wing edge and in some localised regions.

The barn owl flew with a consistent geometry, with positive wing camber and longitudinal anhedral. Based on flight dynamics theory, this suggests it was longitudinally statically unstable during these flights. The peregrine falcon flew with a consistent glide angle, but at a range of air speeds with varying geometry. Unlike the barn owl, its glide configuration did not provide a clear indication of longitudinal static stability/instability.

But what if our world were a single leaf on a single apple tree? Would a heat wave affect us in the same way that it would affect bigger animals and their ecosystems? Sylvain Pincebourde and Jérôme Casas from Université de Tours, France, had an inkling that for itsy bitsy beasts, not all microclimates are created equal. To find out, they delved into the diminutive world of plant-eating mites and insects to see whether these critters can beat the heat., How does one study the microcosm of animals that are only a few millimetres long? Very carefully, taking all environmental factors into account. Pincebourde and Casas chose six species with three different methods of feeding on leaves: two aphids (phloem feeding; phloem is a sugar- and mineral-rich form of sap), a leaf miner (leaf mining), and two spider mites and a lace bug (tissue piercing). First, the authors determined the thermal tolerance limits of each species – or how much heat the critters can handle – by finding their upper lethal temperatures, the temperature at which 50% of the individuals die. They then studied the microclimate on the surface of the leaves by measuring the carbon dioxide intake, water loss and temperature of intact leaves and leaves that had been fed upon by the tiny herbivores. Finally, the authors combined their data on the species’ temperature limits and the leaves’ surface environment to predict just how much heat each species can handle in the wild., Each species had a different thermal tolerance and, incredibly, the upper temperatures that creatures living on the same plant could withstand varied by 8.5°C. The tissue piercers (spider mites and lace bug) could endure higher temperatures than the phloem feeders (aphids), and the leaf miner sat in between. The phloem feeders increased the leaf transpiration rate – that is, they increased the amount of water vapour leaving microscopic holes in the leaf called stomata – while the tissue piercers decreased transpiration a little and the leaf miner was once again in the middle. Importantly, the duo found that the creatures’ ability to withstand heat is directly related to leaf transpiration., By increasing leaf transpiration rates, the phloem feeders, which have the lowest thermal tolerance, were able to minimise the temperature increase of the microclimate surrounding the leaf. This means that they can stay cooler than the species that reduce leaf transpiration and allow leaves to warm. The problem with this strategy is that the phloem feeders cannot handle high temperatures because they have adapted to living in a relatively cool environment, so heat waves may spell more trouble for them than tissue piercers, which live on a relatively hot leaves. The authors’ take-home message is that after taking leaf microclimate into account, spider mites, lace bugs, aphids and leaf miners only have a safety margin of 2–3°C, as half the species were already at risk of overheating at the highest temperature (37°C) tested by the scientists., Mites and insects are likely to be more vulnerable to extreme temperatures than previously thought, and species living in temperate areas may find themselves in serious thermal strife during heat waves. Pincebourde and Casas reveal that current warming tolerances could be overestimated by up to 12°C – an enormous problem for accurately predicting future survival. Additionally, animals with different feeding apparatuses may be at different risks from climate change. It appears that creatures that turn on the air conditioning might not survive as well those that like to live with the windows open.","keywords":"","title":"It's a small world on a hot leaf","authors":"James M.

Yet, beneath the trees on the floor of Costa Rica's tropical cloud forests, the year-round sound of animal chatter never dies down. Alston's singing mice (Scotinomys teguina) carry out raucous conversations with one another as they defend territory or court a mate. Beyond that, how their back-and-forth communication operates is largely unknown. In a new study published in Science, Daniel Okobi Jr and Arkarup Banerjee in the lab of Michael Long at the New York University School of Medicine, USA, describe how male Alston's singing mice avoid interrupting each other and the brain circuit responsible for their chitchat etiquette., To test how the mice responded when a conversation started up, the team initially kept some of the rodents in isolation while recording their solo serenades. Then the scientists relocated the loners to a new home, adjacent to another mouse. However, neither mouse could see or smell the other; they could only communicate by singing. After settling in to his new abode, the team noticed that the incomer became more chatty, singing three times more than he had when there was no audience. What was more striking was how polite the mice were when exchanging words: the mouse that had just moved into the neighbourhood waited patiently until after his new neighbour finished singing and then, within a half a second, rapidly responded with his own tune. This precisely choreographed duetting suggests that singing mice actively track conversations and respond only when the social situation is appropriate., To figure out how singing mice coordinate their colloquy, the researchers investigated the motor cortex, a brain area they suspected to be responsible for polite conversation in mice, and uniquely required for speech production in humans (but not for generating other mammals’ sounds). Knowing that mice become gradually louder and produce notes of longer duration when singing, the team cooled down the motor cortex – to slow down the neural activity. This caused the mice to take longer to spit out what they had to say, but all of the notes were articulated just fine. In contrast, stimulating the motor cortex momentarily interrupted a vocalizing mouse, after which the rodent picked up right where it left off. Lastly, when the team silenced brain activity in the motor cortex with nerve-blocking drugs, the mice still sang as often as before; however, they did not sing back in response to hearing another mouse's song. Taken together, the motor cortex in singing mice seems to be a hub for rapidly perceiving song and precisely orchestrating a vocal reply., Many creatures across the animal kingdom rely on making sounds to communicate with one another: people use language; birds twitter; Alston's mice sing. These findings from Okobi and his colleagues help extend our understanding of how vocal communication evolved in animals and the shared brain areas that enable animals to chatter, in addition to raising the question of just how quiet mice really are.","keywords":"","title":"Singing mice take turns talking","authors":"Daniel M.

Some try to understand how animals use this link to adapt to their changing environments, while others have made it their career goal to uncover how an animal has evolved a specific function. But what if that evolutionary road is not as clear, perhaps because there are missing links in the evolutionary tree and competing theories about how that animal has come to be the way it is today? Or, what if an animal is so different from the rest that it is difficult to tell how it relates to other groups of animals?, Undeterred by such challenges, Tetsuto Miyashita, working out of University of Chicago, Illinois, USA, and University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada, along with an international group of researchers from two different continents, set out to resolve the evolutionary history of a very peculiar creature: the hagfish. It is the only animal to have a skull, but no vertebral column or spine – even though it is classified as a vertebrate – and it produces slime when threatened. Miyashita and his colleagues investigated the creature from a unique perspective by studying the features of a hagfish fossil (Tethymixine tapirostrum) from the Late Cretaceous period found in Lebanon, which they obtained from the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in South Dakota, USA. To add to their challenge, the team tried to reconcile two competing theories about the place of the hagfish in the evolutionary history of the vertebrates: (1) that hagfish are a primitive group of vertebrates, or (2) that they are a separate, specialized group of vertebrates all-together., Using a sophisticated technique for studying minerals in soft tissues, called synchrotron rapid-scanning X-ray fluorescence (SRS XRF), the authors examined the gill and mouth structures of the fossil. Because the fossil lacked paired fins, jaws, a mineral skeleton and features such as an oral sucker, cartilage and dorsal fin, the researchers concluded that it was not an ancestor of either the eel or the lamprey, which are similar; it was certainly a hagfish fossil. Next, the authors examined the fossil's slime glands, which are unique to hagfish. The group determined that it had 133 glands on the right side, which is more than most living hagfishes, but the animal was smaller in size. Using complex statistical analysis and historical data on the structure and evolution of lampreys and eels, the team was then able to assign the hagfish fossil to its rightful place in the evolutionary history of vertebrates. They classified it as the missing link between the last common ancestor of all vertebrates and the living soft-bodied round-mouthed fishes, thus filling a 100 million year gap in evolution., Miyashita and his colleagues’ study is revolutionary, because it shows that features such as lack of vertebral column and the round mouth of living hagfishes, which were previously believed to be primitive, are actually quite specialized, and these ancient animals seem to have evolved new adaptive features, such as their slime glands. The team's findings appear to agree with the second theory about the location of the hagfishes in the tree of life, classifying them as a specialized group rather than a primitive vertebrate. In addition, the team of researchers propose that the last common ancestor of all vertebrates is not a soft-bodied hagfish-like animal, as is the current theory. However, what that animal is, what it looked like and how closely it relates to the modern animals we see today awaits discovery.","keywords":"","title":"The vertebrate story lies in the fossil of a slimy fish","authors":"Oana Birceanu","origin":"OUTSIDE JEB","pub_date":"30 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb192799?rss=1"},{"abstract":"The interaction between the gut microbiota (GM) and the brain has led to the concept of the microbiota-gut-brain axis but data in birds remain scarce. We tested the hypothesis that colonization of germ-free chicks from a quail line selected for a high emotional reactivity (E+) with GM from a line with low emotional reactivity (E-) would reduce their emotional behaviour in comparison with germ-free chicks from E+ line colonized with GM from the same E+ line. The GM composition analysis of both groups revealed a shift in term of microbial diversity and richness between Day 21 and Day 35 and the GM of the two groups of quails were closer to each other at Day 35 than at Day 21 at a phylum level. Quails that received GM from the E- line expressed a lower emotional reactivity than the quails colonized by GM from the E+line in the tonic immobility and the novel environment tests proceeded during the second week of age. This result was reversed in a second tonic immobility test and an open-field run two weeks later. These behavioural and GM modifications over time could be the consequence of the resilience of the GM to recover its equilibrium present in the E+ host, which is in part driven by the host genotype.

But this understanding has long been used as a hallmark of advanced thinking and self-awareness for other species in the animal kingdom. Very few animals are considered self-aware, and this exclusive club is currently limited to mammals including chimpanzees, elephants and dolphins, as well as one bird species. However, researchers from universities in Japan, Switzerland and Germany have suggested that a small tropical fish – the cleaner wrasse – might also be a part of this elite group of thinkers, or perhaps the mirror test is somewhat flawed…, The mirror test typically works like this. First, an animal is shown a mirror. Next, a researcher removes the mirror and places a distinct mark somewhere on the animal's body that could only be seen with the help of a mirror. The mirror is then returned, and the researcher observes whether the animal attempts to remove the mark. Seems simple enough. Passing this test tells us that the animal understands that the reflection is itself, and no fish has ever passed it. But Masanori Kohda and colleagues thought that the cleaner wrasse might be able to. The fish are called cleaner wrasse because they munch parasites from the skin of other fish, or clients, and they are known for having the social intelligence to navigate their cleaner–client relationships. Kohda wondered whether this social intelligence might extend to self-recognition., The researchers tested the wrasse in several phases. First, they left the fish unmarked and recorded how the individuals responded to a mirror. Having never seen a mirror before, the fish attacked – how did another wrasse get in my tank?! But this anger quickly subsided and shifted to something stranger. The fish began moving in ways that had never before been recorded for this species. For instance, they would swim upside-down towards the mirror or rush at it, only to stop right before crashing into it. The team of scientists interpreted these oddities as ‘contingency behaviours’, meaning the fish were exploring their bodies and may be testing whether their reflection would follow suit if they behaved weirdly., Finally, the researchers marked the fish. They started by adding a small injection of clear paint under the scales (a common method for marking fish) to make sure the marking procedure itself did not indicate to the fish they had been marked; it didn't. The fish only inspected the mark in the mirror when the coloured paint was added. Amazingly, the fish would then leave the mirror and try to scrape off the mark by brushing themselves against the sand in their tanks. According to the rules of the mirror test, the wrasses passed., However, the team has not been quick to declare that cleaner wrasses are self-aware. Instead, they conclude that these fish must have some level of self-recognition; whether this extends to a fully realized ‘sense of self’ remains to be seen. Perhaps self-awareness exists on a continuum, instead of being either present or absent, and the mirror test may not capture these nuances. The researchers know that their findings are controversial; the prevailing view among biologists has long been that fish have few advanced cognitive abilities. Kohda's team hopes that their work will encourage others to think carefully about the methods we use to compare intelligence across species. They also point out that we need to re-evaluate our preconceived notions about fish: they may be much smarter than we give them credit for.","keywords":"","title":"Are fish self-aware?","authors":"Erin McCallum","origin":"OUTSIDE JEB","pub_date":"30 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb192781?rss=1"},{"abstract":"In animals that experience interactions with conspecifics while young, social interactions appear to be a necessary prerequisite for typical behaviour. Eusocial insects have large colonies where individuals experience a large number of social interactions with nest mates during all life stages, making them excellent candidates for understanding the effects of social isolation on brain development and behaviour. Here, we used the honey bee Apis mellifera to study the effect of social isolation and group size on reward perception and discrimination learning and memory. We confined day­-old adult workers into three different size groups (1, 8 or 32 bees) for 6 days during a critical period associated with adult behavioural maturation. We quantified their sucrose responsiveness, their ability to use and remember olfactory cues to discriminate between sucrose and salt (i.e. discrimination learning), and four biogenic amines in the brain. We found that the smaller the group size, the more responsive a worker was to the sucrose reward. Honey bees raised in groups of 32 performed the best in the learning trials and had the highest levels of dopamine. We found no effect of group size on memory. The observed group size effect on learning but not memory supports the hypothesis that social interactions modulate learning through the dopaminergic system.","keywords":"Social behaviour, Eusociality, Social isolation, Biogenic amines, Dopamine, Social interactions","title":"Effects of group size on learning and memory in the honey bee Apis mellifera","authors":"Nadejda Tsvetkov, Chelsea N.

However, given the lack of evidence supporting direct sensing and/or regulation of the COM, it remains unclear whether COM mechanics are prioritized in the control scheme of walking. We posit that peripheral musculoskeletal structures, e.g. muscle, are more realistic control targets than the COM, given their abundance of sensorimotor receptors and ability to influence whole-body energetics. As a first test of this hypothesis, we examined whether conservation of stance-phase joint mechanics is prioritized over COM mechanics in a locomotor task where simultaneous conservation of COM and joint mechanics is not feasible: imposed leg-length asymmetry. Positive joint mechanical cost of transport (work per distance traveled; COTJNT) was maintained at values closer to normal walking than COM mechanical cost of transport (COTCOM; P<0.05, N=15). Furthermore, compared with our measures of COM mechanics (COTCOM, COM displacement), joint-level variables (COTJNT, integrated total support moment) also displayed stronger conservation (less change from normal walking) when the participants' self-selected gait was assessed against other possible gait solutions. We conclude that when walking humans are exposed to an asymmetric leg-length perturbation, control of joint mechanics is prioritized over COM mechanics. Our results suggest that mechanical and metabolic effort is likely regulated via control of peripheral structures and not directly at the level of the COM. Joint mechanics may provide a more accurate representation of the underlying locomotor control targets and may prove advantageous in informing predictive models of human walking.","keywords":"Cost of transport, Locomotion, Inverted pendulum, Joint, Control, Prioritization","title":"Is conservation of center of mass mechanics a priority in human walking?

This cardiac response can place a convective limitation on systemic oxygen delivery at high temperatures. To test the hypothesis that autonomic cardiac regulation protects cardiac performance in rainbow trout during acute warming, we investigated adrenergic and cholinergic regulation during the onset and progression of cardiac limitations. We explored the direct effects of adrenergic stimulation by acutely warming an in situ working perfused heart until arrhythmia occurred, cooling the heart to restore rhythmicity and rewarming with increasing adrenergic stimulation. Adrenergic stimulation produced a clear, dose-dependent increase in the temperature and peak fH achieved prior to the onset of arrhythmia. To examine how this adrenergic protection functions in conjunction with cholinergic vagal inhibition in vivo, rainbow trout fitted with ECG electrodes were acutely warmed in a respirometer until they lost equilibrium (CTmax) with and without muscarinic (atropine) and β-adrenergic (sotalol) antagonists. Trout exhibited roughly equal and opposing cholinergic and adrenergic tone on fH that persisted up to critical temperatures. β-Adrenergic blockade significantly lowered peak fH by 14–17%, while muscarinic blockade significantly lowered the temperature for peak fH by 2.0°C. Moreover, muscarinic and β-adrenergic blockers injected individually or together significantly reduced CTmax by up to 3°C, indicating for the first time that cardiac adrenergic stimulation and cholinergic inhibition can enhance acute heat tolerance in rainbow trout at the level of the heart and the whole animal.","keywords":"Upper thermal tolerance, Autonomic regulation, Heart rate, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Cardiac arrhythmia","title":"Autonomic cardiac regulation facilitates acute heat tolerance in rainbow trout: in situ and in vivo support","authors":"Matthew J.

Phenotypic plasticity was initially thought to be beneficial to an organism's physiological fitness but several alternative hypotheses have been proposed with growing empirical support. In this study, we tested the full suite of hypotheses by investigating acclimation responses of locomotor performance for nine populations of five species of sub-Antarctic weevils, using static and fluctuating temperatures. Species showed typical locomotion thermal performance curves with temperature of the maximum speed (Topt) ranging between 22.3±1.7°C (mean±s.e.m.) and 31.1±0.7°C. For most species, Topt was not affected by acclimation. For maximum speed (Umax), significant, positive effects of acclimation were found for all species except a supralittoral one. Individuals acclimated to 0°C showed much lower values than the other two acclimation treatments (15°C and fluctuating 0–15°C). Performance breadth (the index of the breadth of the curve, Tbr) typically showed little response to acclimation. None of the traits of the supralittoral species was affected by acclimation treatment. Responses to stable and fluctuating temperature treatments were similar. Our findings also revealed that the mean estimated activation energy 0.40±0.015 eV (mean±s.e.m.) was lower than for other herbivores, the category to which these weevils belong, suggesting that some form of compensation in the rate–temperature relationship may be evident. Thus, we typically found support for the ‘warmer is better’ hypothesis for acclimation of locomotor performance, although some compensation was evident.","keywords":"Acclimation, Locomotion, Thermal performance, Ectotherm, Sub-Antarctic","title":"Phenotypic plasticity in locomotor performance of a monophyletic group of weevils accords with the ‘warmer is better’ hypothesis","authors":"Anne M.

Mean heart rate (fH) recovered rapidly (<24 h) from anaesthesia and operative procedures. This preceded a more gradual development of heart rate variability (HRV), with instantaneous fH increasing during each lung ventilation cycle. Atropine injection increased mean fH and abolished HRV. Complete autonomic blockade revealed a cholinergic tonus on the heart of 55% and an adrenergic tonus of 37%. Power spectral analysis of HRV identified a peak at the same frequency as ventilation. This correlation was sustained after temperature changes and it was more evident, marked by a more prominent power spectrum peak, when ventilation is less episodic. This HRV component is homologous to that observed in mammals, termed respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Evidence for instantaneous control of fH indicated rapid conduction of activity in the cardiac efferent nervous supply, as supported by the description of myelinated fibres in the cardiac vagus. Establishment of HRV 10 days after surgical intervention seems a reliable indicator of the re-establishment of control of integrative functions by the autonomic nervous system.

Ten young men completed six experimental sessions (3 fatiguing exercises×2 types of fatigue measurements). The fatiguing exercises were: 30 s all-out intensity (AI), 10 min at severe intensity (SI) and 90 min at moderate intensity (MI). Relative Pmax decreased more than IMVC after AI exercise (P=0.005) while the opposite was found after SI (P=0.005) and MI tasks (P<0.001).

Depression of MRFD was greater than Vmax after all fatiguing exercises and during recovery (all P<0.05).

The ovipositors generally consist of three longitudinally connected elements, one dorsal and two ventral valves that can slide along each other. For the parasitic wasp Diachasmimorpha longicaudata, it has been shown that protraction of the ventral valves causes incurving of the ventral valves towards the dorsal one, which results in a change in probing direction. We hypothesize that this shape change is due to differences in bending stiffness along the ovipositor. Alignment of the stiff tip of the dorsal valve with a more flexible ventral S-shaped region situated just behind the tip straightens this S-bend and results in upwards rotation of the ventral tip. We show that the S-shaped region of the ventral valves has a low bending stiffness because it contains soft materials such as resilin. In contrast, the large cross-sectional area of the dorsal valve tip area probably results in a high bending stiffness. Elsewhere, the dorsal valve is less stiff than the ventral valves. Our results support the hypothesis that the interaction between the stiff dorsal valve portion and the more flexible S-shaped region co-determines the configurational tip changes required for steering the ovipositor in any desired direction along curved paths in the substrate. This provides novel insights in the understanding of steering mechanisms of the hymenopteran ovipositor, and for application in man-made probes.","keywords":"Hymenoptera, Material and structural properties, Ovipositor biomechanics, Steering mechanism","title":"Stiffness gradients facilitate ovipositor bending and spatial probing control in a parasitic wasp","authors":"Uroš Cerkvenik, Johan L. van Leeuwen, Alexander Kovalev, Stanislav N.

Streptostyly is considered relatively widespread within lizards, whereas mesokinesis has been documented only for geckos, varanids and anguids. The present study investigated cranial kinesis in the miniaturised scincid Ablepharus kitaibelii by integrating morphological and experimental data.

High-speed cinematography demonstrated that mesokinesis occurs during food uptake, processing and intraoral transport cycles. Bite force measurements showed prolonged and reasonably hard biting even at large gape angles. Based on these data, we formulate a model of the amphikinetic A. kitaibelii skull mechanism, which provides an extension of Frazzetta's quadric-crank model by placing a special emphasis on metakinesis. According to this model, we hypothesise that metakinetic intracranial movements may provide a means for reducing strain in jaw adductor muscles.

To characterize the response to cold exposure, we measured Tb and metabolic rate (MR) of WT and mdm mice at four nominal temperatures: 20, 24, 29 and 34°C. Subsequently, we stimulated NST with noradrenaline. Manipulation of Ta revealed an interaction between genotype and MR: mdm mice had higher MRs at 29°C and lower MRs at 24°C compared with WT mice. NST capacity was lower in mdm mice than in WT mice. Using MR data from a previous study, we compared MR of mdm mice with MR of Perognathus longimembris, a mouse species of similar body mass. Our results indicated low MR and reduced NST of mdm mice. These were more pronounced than differences between mdm and WT mice owing to body mass effects on MR and capacity for NST. Correcting MR using Q10 showed that mdm mice had lower MRs than size-matched P. longimembris, indicating that mutated N2A titin causes severe thermoregulatory defects at all levels. Direct effects of the titin mutation lead to lower shivering frequency. Indirect effects likely lead to a lower capacity for NST and increased thermal conductance through decreased body size.","keywords":"Body temperature regulation, Non-shivering thermogenesis, Muscular dystrophy with myositis, Metabolism","title":"Severe thermoregulatory deficiencies in mice with a deletion in the titin gene TTN","authors":"Carissa A.

These hexapods are positively phototactic, live on the surface of calm waters and usually accumulate close to the riparian vegetation. In laboratory experiments, we measured the wavelength dependence of phototaxis and polarotaxis of P. aquatica in the 346–744 nm and 421–744 nm ranges, respectively. According to our results, the action spectrum of phototaxis is bimodal with two peaks in the blue (λ1=484 nm) and green-yellow (λ2=570 nm) ranges, while polarotaxis operates in the blue spectral range.

This could be an optimal strategy for scavenger/gatherer animals inhabiting landscapes with fewer features. However, animals inhabiting cluttered landscapes, especially predatory animals, may require substantial familiarity with foraging landscapes to forage efficiently. They may acquire such spatial familiarity with increasing age/experience, and eventually reduce their foraging effort without compromising on foraging success/efficiency. To check whether this holds for the individually foraging predatory tropical paper-wasp Ropalidia marginata, we recorded the number and duration of all foraging trips, the identity of foraged materials, and the directions of outbound and inbound flights (with respect to the nest) of known-age wasps for three consecutive days from three naturally occurring colonies; thus, we measured behavioural profiles of wasps of various ages, and not from the same wasp throughout its lifespan. Wasps increased their foraging duration rapidly until about 4 weeks of age, during which they rarely brought food, although some wasps brought building material and water. Thereafter, their foraging duration started decreasing. Nevertheless, their foraging success/efficiency in bringing food kept on increasing. With age, wasps developed individual directional preferences for outbound and inbound flights, indicating the development of spatial memory for rewarding sites. Also, the angular difference between their outbound and subsequent inbound flights gradually increased, indicating older wasps may have followed tortuous foraging routes. High investment in early life to acquire familiarity with foraging landscapes and using that later to perform efficient foraging could be an optimal strategy for individually foraging animals inhabiting feature-rich landscapes.","keywords":"Foraging strategy, Spatial learning and memory, Social hymenoptera, Evolution, Behavioural ecology","title":"Getting older, getting smarter: ontogeny of foraging behaviour in the tropical social wasp Ropalidia marginata","authors":"Souvik Mandal, Anindita Brahma","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"2 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb199844?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Effects of ammonia-N (0.05, 2, 10 and 20 mg l−1) on the neuroendocrine regulation of ammonia transport were investigated in Litopenaeus vannamei. The results showed that corticotrophin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, dopamine, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations in all ammonia-N groups increased significantly between 3 and 12 h. Cortisol increased significantly between 3 and 24 h. All hormones except crustacean hyperglycemic hormone were reduced to control levels. mRNA abundance of guanylyl cyclase increased significantly during the experiment. Dopamine receptor D4 and α2 adrenergic receptor mRNA abundance in treatments decreased significantly at the beginning, and eventually returned to the control level, whereas mRNA abundance of the 5-HT7 receptor increased significantly only within the first 12 h. Changes in protein kinase (PKA, PKG) mRNA abundance were similar to the patterns of biogenic amines and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone, peaking at 6 and 12 h, respectively, whereas PKC mRNA abundance decreased within 24 h. 14-3-3 protein, FXYD2 and cAMP-response element binding protein mRNA abundance increased significantly and peaked at 6 h. β-catenin and T-cell factor mRNA abundance increased significantly throughout the experiment and peaked at 12 h.

However, comparisons between these systems promise important insight into how natural selection deploys the same basic musculoskeletal toolkit – connective tissues, bones, nerves and skeletal muscle – to meet the differing performance criteria of feeding and locomotion. In this study, we compare average joint angular excursions during cyclic behaviors – chewing, walking and running – in a phylogenetic context to explore differences in the optimality criteria of these two systems. Across 111 tetrapod species, average limb-joint angular excursions during cyclic locomotion are greater and more evolutionarily labile than those of the jaw joint during cyclic chewing. We argue that these findings reflect fundamental functional dichotomies between tetrapod locomotor and feeding systems. Tetrapod chewing systems are optimized for precise application of force over a narrower, more controlled and predictable range of displacements, the principal aim being to fracture the substrate, the size and mechanical properties of which are controlled at ingestion and further reduced and homogenized, respectively, by the chewing process. In contrast, tetrapod limbed locomotor systems are optimized for fast and energetically efficient application of force over a wider and less predictable range of displacements, the principal aim being to move the organism at varying speeds relative to a substrate whose geometry and mechanical properties need not become more homogeneous as locomotion proceeds. Hence, the evolution of tetrapod locomotor systems has been accompanied by an increasing diversity of limb-joint excursions, as tetrapods have expanded across a range of locomotor substrates and environments.","keywords":"Joint-angle excursion, Locomotion, Chewing, Cyclic behavior, Phylogenetics","title":"Joint angular excursions during cyclical behaviors differ between tetrapod feeding and locomotor systems","authors":"Michael C.

A lower CoT allows animals to allocate more of their energy budget to growth and reproduction. A higher CoT may cause animals to adjust their movement across different environmental gradients to reduce energy allocated to movement. The aim of this project was to determine whether CoT is a repeatable trait within individuals, and to determine its physiological causes and ecological consequences. We found that CoT is a repeatable trait in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We rejected the hypothesis that mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratios) predicted CoT. We also rejected the hypothesis that CoT is modulated by temperature acclimation, exercise training or their interaction, although CoT increased with increasing acute test temperature. There was a weak but significant negative correlation between CoT and dispersal, measured as the number of exploration decisions made by fish, and the distance travelled against the current in an artificial stream. However, CoT was not correlated with the voluntary speed of fish moving against the current. The implication of these results is that CoT reflects a fixed physiological phenotype of an individual, which is not plastic in response to persistent environmental changes. Consequently, individuals may have fundamentally different energy budgets as they move across environments, and may adjust movement patterns as a result of allocation trade-offs. It was surprising that mitochondrial efficiency did not explain differences in CoT, and our working hypothesis is that the energetics of muscle contraction and relaxation may determine CoT. The increase in CoT with increasing acute environmental temperature means that warming environments will increase the proportion of the energy budget allocated to locomotion unless individuals adjust their movement patterns.","keywords":"Oxygen consumption, Temperature, Exercise, Locomotion, Acclimation, Allocation trade-off","title":"Cost of transport is a repeatable trait but is not determined by mitochondrial efficiency in zebrafish (Danio rerio)","authors":"Miki Jahn, Frank Seebacher","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"30 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb201400?rss=1"},{"abstract":"The ability of a bone to withstand loads depends on its structural and material properties. These tend to differ among species with different modes of locomotion, reflecting their unique loading patterns. The evolution of derived limb morphologies, such as the long limbs associated with jumping, may compromise overall bone strength. We evaluated bone mechanical properties in the Longshanks mouse, which was selectively bred for increased tibia length relative to body mass. We combined analyses of 3D shape and cross-sectional geometry of the tibia, with mechanical testing and bone composition assays, to compare bone strength, elastic properties and mineral composition in Longshanks mice and randomly bred controls. Our data show that, despite being more slender, cortical geometry and predicted bending strength of the Longshanks tibia were similar to controls. In whole bone bending tests, measures of bone bending strength were similar across groups; however, Longshanks tibiae were significantly more rigid, more brittle, and required less than half the energy to fracture. Tissue-level elastic properties were also altered in Longshanks mice, but the bones did not differ from the control in water content, ash content or density. These results indicate that while Longshanks bones are as strong as control tibiae, selection for increased tibia length has altered its elastic properties, possibly through changes in organic bony matrix composition. We conclude that selection for certain limb morphologies, and/or selection for rapid skeletal growth, can lead to tissue-level changes that can increase the risk of skeletal fracture, which in turn may favor the correlated evolution of compensatory mechanisms to mitigate increased fracture risk, such as delayed skeletal maturity.","keywords":"Artificial selection, Bone cross-sectional geometry, Bone stiffness, Bone strength, Longshanks mouse","title":"Selection for longer limbs in mice increases bone stiffness and brittleness, but does not alter bending strength","authors":"Miranda N.

There is a critical need to maintain hydration in terrestrial environments having limited water. Atypical populations of Florida cottonmouth snakes, Agkistrodon conanti, inhabit continental islands with no permanent sources of fresh water. Here, we report investigations related to how these insular snakes maintain water balance considering the mainland conspecifics are semi-aquatic and typically associate with freshwater mesic habitats. We tested three hypotheses related to water relations of insular populations of cottonmouth snakes compared with those on the mainland. (1) Voluntary drinking of fresh water in free-ranging insular snakes should reflect a relationship to recency of rainfall more strongly than in mainland snakes. (2) Insular snakes will tolerate greater dehydration before drinking than will mainland snakes. (3) Insular snakes will avoid drinking seawater more strongly than will those from the mainland. Between 2001 and 2018, we quantitatively estimated the hydration status of 337 individual cottonmouth snakes from insular populations and 30 cottonmouth snakes from mainland Florida, as judged by the tendency of wild-caught snakes to drink fresh water immediately following capture. We found that insular cottonmouth snakes had a higher incidence of dehydration than did mainland cottonmouth snakes (64% versus 23%), and the hydration status of the insular snakes correlated with patterns of precipitation. We also determined experimentally the dehydration threshold for drinking fresh water in insular (mean±s.d. −5.64±4.3%, n=34) and mainland cottonmouth snakes (−5.74±4.5%, n=21), and these were not significantly different. Discrimination tests for drinking serially from a graded series of brackish water showed that mainland snakes did not discriminate against the highest brackish value (10.5 ppt or 30% seawater), whereas insular snakes showed a preference for <15% seawater. Naive neonates from insular and mainland cohorts behaved similarly. The preference of insular snakes for fresh water represents an important aspect of the maintenance of water balance that differs from the mainland conspecifics and is likely a habituated or adaptive response to dependence on rainfall.","keywords":"Water relations, Florida cottonmouth, Island, Drinking, Dehydration, Brackish water","title":"Water relations of an insular pit viper","authors":"Mark R.

Photo credit: Raziel Riemer., Getting off the beaten track and out into the wild is a liberating experience for anyone stuck in the treadmill of city living. But Raziel Riemer, from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel, explains that strolling along a well-paved path is a dramatically different experience from clambering across the boulder-strewn landscapes that he encounters on trails near his home. Knowing that people walk naturally at speeds where they use the least energy, Riemer recalls a ‘light bulb moment’ at the American Society of Biomechanics meeting in 2015, where he combined his passion for walking with his love of science. ‘I realised that sometimes it is more challenging to maintain my balance and not slip or fall when walking on a really rough or rocky trail. That got me wondering if and how I choose my walking speed depending on terrain’, he says. Sharing the idea with his colleague, Rodger Kram, from the University of Colorado Boulder, USA, the pair decided to test whether hikers adjust their walking speed on rocky terrain., Recruiting 10 fit student volunteers, Riemer and Koren Gast laid out a 67 m long trail through rugged landscape on the outskirts of Beer-Sheva and kitted out the hikers with a mask and gas analyser backpack to record their oxygen consumption and CO2 production, so that they could calculate the volunteers’ exertions later. Once the volunteers were comfortable with walking while wearing the mask, Gast asked them to repeat the hike at slow, comfortable and fast paces to see whether there were any differences in their energy use. ‘The terrain gave them some challenge in maintaining their stability’, says Riemer, who also asked the walkers to repeat the exercise, but this time on a level concrete path for comparison., After calculating the walkers’ metabolic rates over 124 hiking trials on the flat and more rugged terrain, Gast converted the values into the amount of energy each walker used to travel over a set distance – known as the cost of transport – and found that the walkers used 115% more energy when negotiating the rough trail than they had on level ground. In addition, the volunteers walked more slowly – at a preferred speed of 1.07 m s−1 – on the rugged route, relative to their preferred speed of 1.24 m s−1 on the flat. And when Gast plotted the walkers’ cost of transport values against the speeds at which they were walking, the U-shaped graphs showed that the volunteers walking on the rough trail moved a little more slowly than their most efficient walking speed, resulting in a slightly less efficient walk., ‘Our interpretation is that people on rough terrain consider other factors, such as stability or foot placement, and as a result they walk slower than the energetically optimal speed’, says Riemer. However, he points out that even though the volunteers were choosing to walk at a less efficient pace, the additional effort that they invested was negligible (0.5%). ‘This means that there is almost no penalty on energetics when a person takes into consideration other factors such as stability. That's a pretty smart design’, says Riemer. And he is optimistic that he can apply the lessons from watching able-bodied hikers to help older, less stable members of the community. ‘Maybe training based on our finding that walking on rough terrain challenges stability and increases effort could improve their fitness’, he suggests.","keywords":"","title":"Hikers trade speed and efficiency for stability","authors":"Kathryn Knight","origin":"INSIDE JEB","pub_date":"30 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb204222?rss=1"},{"abstract":"A nest of Ropalidia marginata wasps. Photo credit: Souvik Mandal., Growing up in rural India, Souvik Mandal was always fascinated by the behaviour of the animals that surrounded him. ‘I was intrigued by the “skills” which our domestic cattle, free-ranging poultry, wild birds and honey bees use to return home’, he recalls with a smile. So, when Mandal joined Raghavendra Gadagkar's lab at the Indian Institute of Science as a graduate student to work on the tropical wasp Ropalidia marginata, he was excited by the blank slate that he was offered. ‘Compared to honey bees and ants, very little was known about the landscape-scale navigation in wasps’, he says. Having discovered that the wasps are capable of learning the local landscape and using the information to return home, Mandal and Anindita Brahma, also from the Institute, wanted to understand the insect's homing strategy. As honey bees take to foraging swiftly after a brief apprenticeship, the duo wondered how the wasps’ foraging strategy develops as they age. But first the pair had to determine of the ages of all of the foragers in the nest., After identifying three candidate nests – located in fuse boxes on lampposts in the Institute campus – Mandal and Brahma stood sentry over each nest every night for 6 months to identify and mark the newly emerged foragers with unique sets of paint identification spots. ‘We basically looked for any new black-eyed wasps’, says Mandal, describing how the eyes of recently emerged wasps fade quickly during their first few days. Having established the ages of all of the foragers, the duo staked-out each nest for three consecutive days, filming the wasps' movements and recording their bearings when they departed and returned, and whether the insects were carrying construction materials, food or water. ‘We had occasional curious visitors’, says Mandal, recalling unwanted attention from humans and animals while he and Brahma attempted to keep track of the busy wasps., Recording over 4000 trips by 272 foragers, Mandal and Brahma were surprised to see that initially the youngest foragers only left the nest once or twice a day, gradually building up their stamina until they were going out as many as six times a day. The youngsters only began returning with food 2 weeks into their foraging careers, at which point they also began cutting back on the number and duration of foraging trips, increasing their foraging success and efficiency as they grew older. Mandal also analysed the direction of the wasps’ departures and it was clear that they began to specialise as they grew older, heading off in all directions early in their careers, but preferring to visit richer locations later in life. ‘This indicates that wasps probably learn and memorise the location of food availability by acquiring sufficient spatial familiarity with their foraging grounds during their early foraging phase’, says Mandal: ‘They become smarter with age’., But why are the strategies of tropical wasps and temperate bees so different? Mandal attributes the wasps’ relatively long apprenticeship to the cluttered tropical environment in which they make their homes; they rarely experience uninterrupted views that could allow them to get their bearings. And he adds that the unguided wasps pursue prey that are constantly moving, in contrast to bees, which are directed by nest mates to stationary blooms. ‘This enables us to understand how the environment in which animals evolve shapes different behaviour and strategies’, says Mandal.","keywords":"","title":"Tropical paper wasps serve long apprenticeships","authors":"Kathryn Knight","origin":"INSIDE JEB","pub_date":"2 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb204230?rss=1"},{"abstract":"<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/222/9/jeb205260/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>, Ewald R. Weibel passed away on 19 February, aged 89. His remarkable intellect remained intact even as his physical condition worsened. He continued to be fully engaged scientifically at the time of his death, in close professional contact with his longtime associates Connie Hsia (University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) and Matthias Ochs (Charité, Berlin). It will come as no surprise to those who knew him that he was preparing his ultimate research paper, finishing the draft for its Introduction just 2 weeks before his final hospitalization., Weibel's journey from his childhood home in Zurich to membership into the National Academy of Sciences was an interesting one with many unexpected turns. He came from a modest family background; his father was a typewriter mechanic. It was a financial stretch for the family to have their son studying medicine, which he did with a state stipend. When Weibel graduated, he had to find employment, as interns then rarely received a salary during their first 2 years of clinical training. Little did he know that this ‘outside employment’ would set a path on which he would remain for his entire scientific career. His job in pathology was a mandate to study the anastomosing vessels between the bronchiolar and the pulmonary circulation. In an ingenious experiment, he showed that the particular structure of these arteries, with longitudinal muscle strands in the intima, could be attributed to the stretch to which these arteries were subjected during ventilation, unrelated to their anastomosis function. This work earned him a 2 year fellowship jointly funded by the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences and the National Institutes of Health. His intention was to study the physiology of the collateral circulation in the lung in André Cournand's laboratory at Columbia University (Cournand had received the Nobel Prize in Physiology just previously in 1956). Newly wed to his supportive wife Verena, they travelled to New York by ship. After a short stint in Avriell Liebow’s laboratory at Yale, and after a successful seminar at Columbia, Weibel realized his dream and joined Cournand's team. As one might surmise, Nobel Laureates are outstanding ‘talent scouts’, and Cournand immediately offered him a laboratory and generous resources with only one requirement: ‘Do anything on the structure of the lung that is of interest to physiology’., As Weibel started his work in Cournand's laboratory, he made a crucial acquaintance. In September 1959 he met Domingo Gomez, a brilliant exiled Cuban biophysicist also working in Cournand's laboratory whose interest was modelling gas exchange in the human lung from first principles. Together, they soon realized that to do realistic modelling of gas exchange, they must rely on quantitative data on the anatomical structures relevant for gas exchange. As the lung's surface area is only anatomically accessible on thin sections of lung tissue, a serious problem had to be solved: how to make accurate estimates of physiologically relevant structural properties in three dimensions from measurements made on tissue sections in two dimensions. Aspects of this problem had previously been solved for metallurgy and geology, but these techniques had not been applied in biology. So together with Hans Elias, Weibel was an early key promoter of a branch of probabilistic geometry later to be named ‘stereology’ or ‘morphometry’. Stereological estimates of some quantitative parameters of the lung and a model of the branching pattern of the alveolar tree led Weibel and Gomez to publish a landmark paper on the architecture of the human lung., However, it soon became clear that the resolution of light microscopy was simply not good enough to resolve the intricate structure of the interface between the air space and the erythrocyte in the lung capillary to realistically model lung diffusion capacity from structural quantities. In 1961, Weibel realized that he needed the resolution power afforded by electron microscopy to obtain the structural estimates needed for physiologically relevant modelling. Fortunately for Weibel, Cournand established contacts with George Palade at Rockefeller. Palade was a pioneer of electron microscopy who went on to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1974 for his contributions in laying the structural foundation for cell biology. Weibel was thus able to learn electron microscopy, the then cutting-edge tool of biology, at Palade's laboratory. The resolution of electron microscopy allowed for structural measurements of the last step of the oxygen transfer from the air in the alveoli, through the tissue barrier and the plasma space into the red cell, as needed for the modelling efforts of Gomez., While at Rockefeller, Weibel came across peculiar tubular structures that he found in endothelial cells of a rat lung but also in endothelia of other tissues. These structures had not been described before, and with Palade he published his findings. Today these structures are known as ubiquitous markers of endothelial cells under the name of ‘Weibel–Palade bodies’. Much later, in 1982, it became known that the Weibel–Palade bodies contain, amongst other things, the von Willebrand factor, which is a key component of coagulation., By 1962, Weibel, his student visa expired, was forced to return to Switzerland. The University of Zurich offered him an assistant professorship with the task to set up the first electron microscopy unit. It was not long before Swiss universities were competing for Weibel's skills and intellect, and in 1964, at the age of 35, he accepted an offer to become the Director of the Department of Anatomy of the University of Bern. With considerable financial support of the canton of Bern, Weibel was tasked to establish a cutting-edge institution for quantitative structural research. This gamble by the University of Bern paid off big time, as this institute became the reference laboratory for quantitative structural analyses on the microscopic and electron microscopic level world-wide and is known as the nurturing ground for the development of stereology. Weibel's love for stereology had much to do with the fact that stereological measurement techniques are derived from first principles and, when done correctly, allow for obtaining unbiased estimates for volumes, surfaces, lengths and numbers of structures or compartments in biological samples. Stereological techniques are basically the only unbiased approach to assess biological properties, as the stereological tools are derived from mathematical principles. Any other assay that is used today in biology (be it biochemical or molecular) is, by necessity, biased., The main focus of the experimental work at Weibel's laboratory continued to be the gas exchange apparatus. He was keenly interested in the potential malleability of the pulmonary gas exchanger with exercise and hypoxia but also understood the value in comparative physiology. He studied the lungs of very small mammals, such as the 3 g Etruscan shrew, as well as human lungs that were collected post-mortem. In various collaborations he also made his morphometric techniques available for the study of fish gills and the lungs of birds. An important finding of these studies was that in a comparative context, pulmonary diffusing capacity, as measured by morphometric techniques, scaled in direct proportion to body mass (scaling factor 1) whereas resting oxygen consumption scaled to body mass with a scaling factor of 0.75 – an apparent discrepancy., As his pursuits grew, he never lost his interest in the nature of the Weibel–Palade bodies. So on his first sabbatical in 1975 he decided to once again join his old friend Palade, and together they used cell biological techniques to unravel the function of the tiny tubular structures in endothelia that carried his name. It turned out that this was one of the few projects that Weibel did not finish with success; a reminder of how failure is an integral part of success. Indeed, this led to a long and productive new direction., The failure to unravel the secret of the Weibel–Palade bodies gave Weibel the opportunity to meet C. Richard (‘Dick’) Taylor, a Harvard University comparative physiologist who had a gift for measuring the maximum aerobic capacity (V̇O2,max) in a number of mammalian species of different body size. The two of them decided to join forces to launch an expedition to Kenya with the aim of understanding oxygen uptake, transport and utilization across species. To do this, they measured V̇O2,max data on as many wild African species as possible and coupled those data with samples of lung and muscle morphometry from the same animals. This gigantic project was the start of a close friendship between Weibel and Taylor that lasted until Taylor's death in 1995. It was also the start of an extremely fruitful collaboration between Taylor's laboratory at the Concorde Field Station of Harvard University and the Department of Anatomy of the University of Bern. The collaboration resulted in more than 25 joint publications. The unique contributions of this research matched the maximal oxygen uptake of animals to their relevant quantitative structural features of the heart, the circulation and the skeletal muscle tissue. This body of work provided countless insights into the design of the entire respiratory cascade in mammals in a coherent quantitative frame and under limiting physiological conditions of V̇O2,max., One indisputable finding of this long collaboration was the close match between structure and function in the design of the mammalian respiratory system, linking the ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’ steps of the respiratory cascade. Weibel coined the term of ‘symmorphosis’ to denote that each step of the cascade was exactly quantitatively tuned to demand: there was enough – but not too much – structure to support oxygen flow. But he also found one apparent exception to his concept of symmorphosis – namely, the lung. The analysis indicated that there was seemingly excess lung structure in large animals. This finding continued to bother him for the rest of his career and through all of his retirement. In fact, the last manuscript he was working on dealt with this problem and the potential effect that shorter alveolar duct lengths in small animals could have on the condition of oxygen transfer between the alveolar air space and erythrocytes., Weibel will be remembered as an outstanding scientist. His articles and books cover three main areas: lung structure and function, stereology, and the design of the respiratory system. For his work, he has received a number of prestigious academic prizes such as the Marcel Benoist Prize, the Anders Retzius Medal and the Purkinje Gold Medal. He also served in many academic functions such as Rector of the University of Bern, President of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences and President of the International Union of Physiological Sciences. Above all, Weibel was an inspiration to all who had the chance of working with him. He had a piercing mind, he loved the academic battle and he hated any kind of dishonesty. It was important for him to follow and foster the career of his many collaborators. Throughout his career and as a head of the Department of Anatomy, he shouldered a full teaching load. He was a brilliant and engaging role model for all medical students and he remained proud of his first academic vocation as a medical doctor. He will be sorely missed. Ewald Weibel leaves behind his wife Verena, whom he had lovingly cared for during the final years of his life.","keywords":"","title":"Ewald R. Weibel (1929–2019)","authors":"Hans Hoppeler, Stan L.

Photo credit: Mark Sandfoss., Castaways usually meet their fate by washing ashore on a desert island, but not the cottonmouth pit vipers (Agkistrodon conanti) of the Cedar Keys, Florida. ‘Our understanding is that these islands formed in the recent past as relic sand dunes that were connected to the mainland via dry land until sea levels rose’, says Mark Sandfoss from the University of Florida, USA. And when the reptiles found themselves cut off from sources of fresh water, they really were left high and dry. ‘Cottonmouths are almost exclusively found in freshwater habitats’, explains Sandfoss; which made him and his thesis advisor, Harvey Lillywhite, wonder how the marooned serpents manage their thirst when surrounded by undrinkable seawater., ‘Harvey has been collecting drinking data on free-ranging cottonmouths for decades’, says Sandfoss, describing how Lillywhite picks up the vipers with a hook, weighs them and offers them a bowl of water to drink. He then reweighs the animals immediately after they have slaked their thirst to determine how much water they have consumed. After joining Lillywhite's lab in 2013, Sandfoss began comparing Lillywhite's observations of how likely the snakes were to drink with the amount of rainfall on the islands and found that the animals that had experienced the longest drought gulped down the largest volume, while snakes that had experienced rainfall in recent days were less eager to drink. However, when the scientists compared the island cottonmouths’ drinking habits with those of their mainland cousins, which live in swamps and rivers, 64% of the island animals were dehydrated while only 24% of their mainland cousins needed a drink. The duo realised that the island cottonmouths depend on rainwater and go thirsty between rainfalls., The scientists then wondered whether the water-deprived castaways were able to suppress their thirst more than the mainland population, so Sandfoss allowed island and mainland snakes to go thirsty and then recorded the animals’ mass when they decided that they needed a drink. ‘We found a large variation in the thirst responses of snakes from the two populations, with some snakes drinking after losing less than 2% mass while others from the same population did not drink until they had lost more than 12%’, says Sandfoss. However, when the scientists compared the two groups of animals, there was no difference in their thirst threshold, so the castaways don't seem to have altered their thirst tolerance in response to their tropical-island lifestyle., The pair then investigated how the two populations would react when offered a drink of salt water. ‘We know that even the most well-adapted sea snakes require fresh water for drinking and this made us think that insular cottonmouths would not be able to rely on seawater’, says Sandfoss. Discovering quickly that both populations turned up their noses at full-strength – and even 25% – seawater, Sandfoss then offered thirsty mainland and island cottonmouths increasingly dilute saltwater drinks and found that most of the island snakes (19) refused the salty drinks: only 7 chanced a sip. However, the mainland cottonmouths were far less discriminating, with 6 sipping the saltiest (30%) water and only 7 holding off until they were offered fresh water. Also, when the duo compared the water preferences of newborns, it seemed that the island youngsters had inherited their parents’ aversion to salt water., Castaway cottonmouths have evolved the ability to detect and avoid drinking seawater, even though the prospect may seem tempting when the rains fail, but do not supress their thirst, and Sandfoss is keen to find out how the marooned snakes sniff out the difference between fresh and salt water when feeling parched.","keywords":"","title":"Castaway cottonmouths depend on rain to slake thirst","authors":"Kathryn Knight","origin":"INSIDE JEB","pub_date":"8 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb205526?rss=1"},{"abstract":"A newly hatched clownfish larva curled ready to strike at plankton. Photo credit: Eve Robinson., When a predatory fish prepares to strike at an unsuspecting victim, it twists its body into a deadly S-shape, ready to straighten instantaneously as it lunges forward. But as any parent knows, it can take a while for youngsters to get to grips with feeding themselves, and fish larvae are no exception. Although some lack the speed and accuracy to intercept a moving target, opting for a more sedentary diet until their coordination improves, others manage to seize passing snacks successfully despite their diminutive size. Yet it was unclear whether these feisty larvae follow in their parents’ S-shaped footsteps, or tread a different path to snap up their prey. Intrigued by the possibility that the larvae that target live dinners do something different from mum and dad, Lillian Tuttle, Eve Robinson, Mary Fashingbauer, Daniel Hartline and Petra Lenz from the Pacific Biosciences Research Center, Hawaii, USA, with Rudi Strickler from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, USA, decided to catch clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris) larvae in the act of pouncing on scrumptious plankton to find out how their attacks unfurl as they age., After rearing minute freshly hatched clownfish newborns in the lab, Robinson offered the hungry larvae – ranging in age from 1–5, 6–9 to 11–14 days old – the chance to strike at nippy home-grown copepods while she and Strickler filmed the youngsters’ high-speed lunges. ‘It was challenging to film microscopic interactions between a freely swimming fish larva and a copepod while keeping both in focus’, chuckles Robinson, adding that Strickler's camera system was perfectly designed to follow the larvae's strikes with high precision., When Fashingbauer painstakingly digitised the larvae's postures as they curled their bodies in preparation for a strike, it was clear that instead of coiling into a curvy S, they twisted their rear ends into a general J-shape; the youngest (∼5.5 mm long) larvae struck a question-mark-shaped pose, while the oldest pulled a looser hockey stick-shaped posture, bending their tails to one side before striking at a passing copepod. Analysing the youngsters’ manoeuvres in fine detail, Fashingbauer and Tuttle could also see that the oldest larvae (6.7–10.3 mm long) were able to accelerate up to speeds of 240 mm s−1, while the youngest and smallest larvae still managed a respectable 160 mm s−1, capturing their copepod treats in 9 ms. In addition, Tuttle and Lenz realised that the stealthy hunters depend on their pectoral fins to stabilise their body position by wafting them to and fro alternately as they creep forward before unleashing their powerful tail beat, unlike anchovy larvae, which continue beating their tails until the final push. Also, the youngest clownfish larvae appeared to target the youngest plankton larvae, whereas the more mature larvae graduated to consuming adult copepods., ‘The combination of the clownfish's extreme J-shaped posture and alternate sculling of its pectoral fins likely minimises disturbance during its predatory approach while precisely aligning it with the prey’, says Tuttle, explaining that the copepods are worthy adversaries, capable of making a rapid escape when they sense an approaching larva. And she suspects that the clownfish's lopsided strategy may represent one example of many possible alternative strategies adopted by larval fish in their progression to adulthood.","keywords":"","title":"Clownfish larvae J-curl to catch copepods","authors":"Kathryn Knight","origin":"INSIDE JEB","pub_date":"9 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb206177?rss=1"},{"abstract":"The diamondback terrapin is the only temperate turtle species that exclusively inhabits estuarine habitats. Morphological, behavioral and physiological features contribute to the terrapin's ability to regulate body fluid osmotic pressure in a euryhaline environment. Low integument permeability combined with aquatic-terrestrial shuttling behavior limits passive exchange of water and salts with the environment, and terrapins regulate active uptake of salts via alterations in drinking and feeding behavior. The lachrymal salt gland facilitates excretion of excess sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions through active transport mechanisms. We investigated body fluid dynamics, oxygen consumption (V̇O2), and osmotic status of terrapins exposed to an acute increase in salinity (12 to 35 psu) at 10°C and 25°C to gain insight into the relative importance of behavioral vs. physiological osmoregulatory adjustments over a range of seasonally-relevant temperatures. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of experimental temperature, salinity, and mass. Overall, temperature effects were stronger than salinity effects. Terrapins acclimated to 25°C had significantly lower blood osmolality and Na+, and higher water turnover rates, daily water flux (DWF), and V̇O2 compared with terrapins acclimated to 10°C. Salinity effects were restricted to DWF, which significantly decreased in response to acute exposure to 35 psu. Our results support the notion that behavioral adjustments predominate in the osmoregulatory strategy of terrapins.","keywords":"Osmoregulation, Energetics, Oxygen consumption, Salt gland, Water balance, Reptile","title":"Effects of temperature and salinity on body fluid dynamics and metabolism in the estuarine Diamond-backed Terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin)","authors":"Amanda Southwood Williard, Leigh Anne Harden, T.

This paper explores the behaviour of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle and its tendinous tissue during gait, as it absorbs energy during contact and controls foot position during swing. Simultaneous measurements of ultrasound, surface electromyography and 3-dimensional motion capture with musculoskeletal modelling from twelve healthy participants were recorded as they walked at preferred and fast walking speeds. We quantified the length changes and velocities of the TA muscle-tendon unit and its fascicles across the stride at each speed. Fascicle length changes and velocities were relatively consistent across speeds, although the magnitude of fascicle length change differed between the deep and superficial regions. At contact, when the TA is actively generating force, the fascicles remained relatively isometric as the MTU actively lengthened, presumably stretching the TA tendinous tissue and absorbing energy. This potentially protects the muscle fibres from damage during weight acceptance and allows energy to be returned to the system later in the stride. During early swing the fascicles and MTU both actively shortened to dorsiflex the foot, clearing the toes from the ground; although, at the fast walking velocity the majority of the shortening occurred through tendinous tissue recoil, highlighting its role in accelerating ankle dorsi-flexion to power rapid foot clearance in swing.","keywords":"Tibialis anterior, Walking, Ultrasound, Energy absorption","title":"Tibialis anterior tendinous tissue plays a key role in energy absorption during human walking","authors":"Jayishni N.

Although thermal developmental plasticity has been studied in Drosophila for several traits, it is not entirely clear how it affects reproductive fitness. We, therefore, investigated how developmental temperature affects reproductive performance (early fecundity and egg-to-adult viability) of wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster. We have tested competing hypotheses on the character of developmental thermal plasticity using a full factorial design with three developmental and adulthood temperatures within the natural thermal range of this species. To account for potential intraspecific differences, we examined flies from tropical (India) and temperate (Slovakia) climate zones. Our results show that flies from both populations raised at intermediate developmental temperature (25°C) have comparable or higher early fecundity and fertility at all tested adulthood temperatures, while lower (17°C) or higher developmental temperatures (29°C) did not entail any advantage under the tested thermal regimes. Importantly, the superior thermal performance of flies raised at 25°C is apparent even after taking two traits positively associated with reproductive output into account – body size and ovariole number. Thus, in Drosophila melanogaster, development at a given temperature does not necessarily provide any advantage at this thermal environment in terms of reproductive fitness. Our findings strongly support the optimal developmental temperature hypothesis which claims that at different thermal environments the highest fitness is achieved when an organism is raised at its optimal developmental temperature.","keywords":"Developmental plasticity, Acclimation, Drosophila, Drosophila, Fecundity, Viability, Ovariole number, Body size","title":"Reproductive fitness of Drosophila is maximised by optimal developmental temperature","authors":"Peter Klepsatel, Thirnahalli Nagaraj Girish, Heinrich Dircksen, Martina Gáliková","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"7 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.202184v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Honeybees use visual and olfactory cues to detect flowers during foraging trips. Hence, the reward association of a nectar source is a multimodal construct which has at least two major components – olfactory and visual cues. How both sensory modalities are integrated to form a common reward association and whether and how they may interfere, is an open question. The present study used stimulation with UV, blue and green light to evoke distinct photoreceptor activities in the compound eye and two odour components (Geraniol, Citronellol). To test if a compound of both modalities is perceived as the sum of its elements (elemental processing) or as a unique cue (configural processing) we combined monochromatic light with single odour components in positive (PP) and negative patterning (NP) experiments. During PP, the compound of two modalities was rewarded, whereas the single elements were not. For NP, stimuli comprising a single modality were rewarded, whereas the olfactory-visual compound was not. Furthermore, we compared the differentiation abilities between two light stimuli with and without being part of an olfactory-visual compound. Interestingly, the behavioural performances revealed a prominent case of configural processing, but only in those cases when UV light was an element of an olfactory-visual compound. Instead, learning with green- and blue-containing compounds rather supports elemental processing theory.","keywords":"PER conditioning, Positive and negative patterning, Multimodal integration, Olfaction, Vision, Associative learning and memory","title":"UV-light perception is modulated by the odour element of an olfactory-visual compound in restrained honeybees","authors":"Mira C.

MTs of caterpillars are notably complex and consist of several regions that display prominent differences in ion transport. The distal ileac plexus (DIP) is a region of Malpighian tubule that is of particular interest because it switches from ion secretion to ion reabsorption in larvae fed on ion-rich diets. The pathways of solute transport in the DIP are not well understood, but one potential route is the paracellular pathway between epithelial cells. This pathway is regulated by the septate junctions (SJs) in invertebrates, and in this study, we found regional and cellular heterogeneity in expression of several integral SJ proteins. DIP of larvae fed ion-rich diets demonstrated a reduction in paracellular permeability, coupled with alterations in both SJ morphology and the abundance of its molecular components. Similarly, treatment in vitro with helicokinin (HK), an antidiuretic hormone identified by previous studies, altered mRNA abundance of many SJ proteins and reduced paracellular permeability. HK was also shown to target a secondary cell-specific SJ protein Tsp2A. Taken together, our data suggest that dietary ion loading, known to cause ion transport reversal in the DIP of larval T. ni, leads to alterations in the paracellular permeability, SJ morphology and its molecular component abundance. The results suggest that HK is an important endocrine factor that co-regulates ion transport, water transport and paracellular permeability in MTs of larval lepidopterans. We propose that co-regulation of all three components of the MT function in larval lepidopterans allows for safe toggling between ion secretion and reabsorption in the DIP in response to variations in dietary ion availability.","keywords":"Septate junctions, Malpighian tubules, Lepidoptera, Ion transport reversal, Paracellular permeability","title":"Septate junction in the distal ileac plexus of larval lepidopteran Trichoplusia ni: alterations in paracellular permeability during ion transport reversal","authors":"Dennis Kolosov, Sima Jonusaite, Andrew Donini, Scott P.

While these have been studied in detail in humans, only looming responses have been well characterized in insects and we know nothing about the role of stereo cues and how they might interact with looming cues. We used our 3D insect cinema in a series of experiments to investigate the role of the stereo cues mentioned above, as well as looming, in the perception of motion-in-depth during predatory strikes by the praying mantis Sphodromantis lineola. Our results show that motion-in-depth does increase the probability of mantis strikes but only for the classic looming stimulus, an expanding luminance edge. Approach indicated by radial motion of a texture or expansion of a motion-defined edge, or by stereoscopic cues, all failed to elicit increased striking. We conclude that mantises use stereopsis to detect depth but not motion-in-depth, which is detected via looming.","keywords":"Changing disparity, Interocular velocity differences, Looming, Mantis, Predation, Stereopsis","title":"Motion-in-depth perception and prey capture in the praying mantis Sphodromantis lineola","authors":"Vivek Nityananda, Coline Joubier, Jerry Tan, Ghaith Tarawneh, Jenny C.

In the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), the coordinated activity of the Malpighian tubules and anterior midgut maintains water and ion balance during the post-prandial diuresis. Three to four hours after the meal the diuretic process finishes, and the animal enters an antidiuretic state to ensure water conservation until the next blood intake. The diuretic and antidiuretic processes are tightly regulated by serotonin and neuropeptides in this insect. In the present work, we report that the neuropeptide precursor CCHamide 2 is involved in the regulation of the post-prandial diuresis in the kissing bug R. prolixus. Our results suggest a dual effect of RhoprCCHamide2 peptide, enhancing the serotonin-induced secretion by Malpighian tubules, and inhibiting serotonin-induced absorption across the anterior midgut. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a hormone presenting opposite effects in the two osmoregulatory organs (i.e. midgut and Malpighian tubules) in insects, probably reflecting the importance of a well-tuned diuretic process in hematophagous insects during different moments after the blood meal.","keywords":"Insect, Anterior midgut, Malpighian tubules, Chagas disease, Hematophagy","title":"The neuropeptide CCHamide 2 regulates diuresis in the Chagas’ disease vector Rhodnius prolixus","authors":"Natalia Capriotti, Juan P.

The eversible vesicles are their unique paired transporting organs, which consist of an epithelium located inside a tube-like structure called the collophore on the first abdominal segment. The vesicles can be protruded out of the collophore and several lines of evidence indicate that they have a vital function in water uptake and ion balance. However, the amount of water absorbed by the vesicles and which other ions apart from sodium are transported remain unknown. Using Orchesella cincta as a model, we developed protocols for two assays that enabled us to study water and ion movement across the eversible vesicles in whole living springtails. Using an inverse Ramsay assay we demonstrate that the eversible vesicles absorb water from a droplet applied onto their surface. Using the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET) we show that the vesicles absorb Na+ and Cl− from the bathing medium, secrete NH4+, and both absorb and secrete K+. H+ is secreted at a low level in the anterior part and absorbed at the posterior part. We did not detect transport of Ca2+ at significant levels. The highest flux was the absorption of Cl−, and the magnitude of ion fluxes were significantly lower in fully hydrated springtails.

Consequently, mainly natural selection is considered to have shaped the attachment system in relation to weight load and substrate. However, sexual selection may also be important because many animals attach to the partner during mating. Both hypotheses generate opposing predictions in species where males are smaller than females. Natural selection predicts the attachment ability to scale positively with load, and hence body size, and so be larger in females than males. Sexual selection predicts attachment forces in males to be larger than females, despite the males’ smaller size because males benefit from uninterrupted copulation by stronger attachment to the female. We tested these predictions in the common bedbug Cimex lectularius, a species in which both sexes, as well as nymphs, regularly carry large loads, blood meals of up to three times the body weight. By measuring attachment forces to smooth surfaces and analysing in-situ fixed copulating pairs and the morphology of attachment devices, we show i) that males generate twice the attachment force of females, although weighing 15 % less, ii) that males adhere to females during copulation using hairy tibial adhesive pads, iii) more setae, and more setae per unit area, in the pads of males than females but no difference in shape of tarsal setae, and iv) the absence of hairy tibial attachment pads and low attachment force in nymphs. These results are consistent with a sexually selected function of attachment in bedbugs. Controlling sperm transfer and mate guarding by attaching to females during copulation may also shape the evolution of male attachment structures in other species. More generally, we hypothesise the existence of arms races of male attachment structures and female counterparts to impede attachment which may result in a similar evolutionary diversification as male genitalia.","keywords":"Adhesive setae, Centrifugal force test, Fossulae spongiosa, Resilin, Safety factor, Sexual conflict, Tibial setae","title":"Evidence for a sexually selected function of the attachment system in bedbugs Cimex lectularius (Heteroptera, Cimicidae)","authors":"Klaus Reinhardt, Dagmar Voigt, Stanislav N.

Infection by S. carpocapsae significantly up-regulated Vg mRNA expression in the male body. The corresponding increase in Vg protein expression was also confirmed by electrophoretic and immunoblotting analyses. Remarkably, in females, the tendency was opposite. Nematodal infection significantly reduced both Vg mRNA and Vg protein expression levels in fat body and hemolymph, respectively. We speculate that infection of reproductive females reduces Vg expression to the level, which is still sufficient for defense, but insufficient for reproduction. This circumstance reduces energy expenditure and helps the individual to cope with the infection. Importantly, purified Vg significantly inhibited growth of Xenorhabdus spp., an entomotoxic bacteria isolated from S. carpocapsae. However, the effect of Vg against I. fumosorosea was not so obvious. The fungus significantly stimulated Vg gene expression in males, however, a similar increase was not recapitulated on the protein level. Nevertheless, in females, both mRNA and protein Vg levels were significantly reduced after the fungal infection. The obtained data demonstrate that Vg is likely an important defense protein, possibly with a specific activity. This considerably expands the known spectrum of Vg functions, as its primary role was thought to be limited to regulating egg development in the female body.","keywords":"Insect, Vitellogenin, Infection, Entomopathogenic nematode, Entomopathogenic fungus, Antimicrobial activity","title":"Changes in vitellogenin expression caused by nematodal and fungal infections in insects","authors":"Dalibor Kodrík, Emad Ibrahim, Umesh K.

It is composed of two chambers, here called the anterior and posterior stomach chambers, ASC and PSC respectively. The PSC contains a filtration structure variously called a pyloric filter, filter press, gastric filter or gastric sieve (GS) and the latter will be used here. The GS resembles an elongated, inverted-V, dome-like, chitinous structure with a midline ridge that is integral to the ventral base of the PSC. The dome surface is covered with a carpet-like layer of minute, comb-like setae bearing laterally-branching setulae. This carpet serves as a selective filter that excludes large partially-digested food particles but allows smaller particles and soluble materials to enter hepatopancreatic ducts that conduct them into the shrimp hepatopancreas (HP) where further digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place. Although the GS function is well known, its exclusion limit for particulate material has not been clearly defined. Using histological and ultra-structure analysis, we show that the GS sieve pore diameter is approximately 0.2-0.7 μm in size, indicating a size exclusion limit (SEL) of substantially less than 1 μm. Using fluorescent microbeads we show that particles of 1 μm diameter could not pass the GS but that those 0.1 μm diameter did pass through to accumulate in longitudinal grooves and move onto the HP where some were internalized by tubule epithelial cells.

Vitamin E significantly reduced liver total antioxidant capacity, while corticosterone depressed brain lipid peroxidation. Prenatal exposure to vitamin E and corticosterone appears to have antagonistic effects on body growth, although vitamin E is not limiting in yellow-legged gull eggs. In combination with the results of previous experiments on the same species applying smaller experimental doses or focusing on the post-natal rather than pre-natal life stages, our findings indicate that the effects of a physiological increase in the egg concentrations of these substances can be life stage- and dose-specific, implying that generalizing prenatal effects of egg compounds may not be feasible.","keywords":"Corticosterone, Embryo growth, Yellow-legged gull, Oxidative status, Vitamin E","title":"Prenatal independent and combined effects of yolk vitamin E and corticosterone on embryo growth and oxidative status in the yellow-legged gull","authors":"Marco Parolini, Cristina Daniela Possenti, Simona Secomandi, Silvia Carboni, Manuela Caprioli, Diego Rubolini, Andrea Romano, Nicola Saino","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"1 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.199265v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Despite the common assumption that the brain is mainly malleable to surrounding conditions during ontogeny, plastic neural changes can occur also in adulthood.

Here, we tested the effects of both learning and environmental enrichment on neural plasticity in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), by means of either a reversal-learning test or a spatial-learning test.

The GM composition analysis of both groups revealed a shift in term of microbial diversity and richness between Day 21 and Day 35 and the GM of the two groups of quails were closer to each other at Day 35 than at Day 21 at a phylum level. Quails that received GM from the E- line expressed a lower emotional reactivity than the quails colonized by GM from the E+line in the tonic immobility and the novel environment tests proceeded during the second week of age. This result was reversed in a second tonic immobility test and an open-field run two weeks later. These behavioural and GM modifications over time could be the consequence of the resilience of the GM to recover its equilibrium present in the E+ host, which is in part driven by the host genotype.

Thus, we hypothesized that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development induces morphological changes that remain after hatching. To test this hypothesis, chicken embryos were incubated entirely (21 days) under normoxia or partially under hypoxia (15% O2 during days 12 to 18). Lung structures, including air capillaries, blood capillaries, infundibula, atria, parabronchial lumen, bronchi, blood vessels larger than capillaries (Bv) and interparabronchial tissue (It), in 1- and 10-day-old chicks were analyzed using light microscopy-assisted stereology. Tissue barrier and surface area of air capillaries were measured using electron microscopy-assisted stereology, allowing for calculation of the anatomical diffusion factor. Hypoxia increased the relative volumes of air and blood capillaries, structures directly involved in gas exchange, while decreased the relative volumes of atria in both groups of chicks, and the parabronchial lumen in older chicks. Accordingly, the surface area of the air capillaries and the anatomical diffusion factor were increased under hypoxic incubation. Treatment did not alter total lung volume, relative volumes of infundibula, bronchi, Bv, It, or the tissue barrier of any group. We conclude that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development lead to a morphological remodeling, characterized by increased volume density and respiratory surface area of structures involved in gas exchange at the expense of structures responsible for air conduction in chicks up to 10 days old.","keywords":"Incubation, Blood capillary, Air capillary, Lung, Blood-gas tissue barrier, Chicken","title":"Parabronchial remodeling in chicks in response to embryonic hypoxia","authors":"Lara do Amaral-Silva, Markus Lambertz, Fernando José Zara, Wilfried Klein, Luciane Helena Gargaglioni, Kênia Cardoso Bícego","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"26 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.197970v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Birds primarily create and control the forces necessary for flight through changing the shape and orientation of their wings and tail.

The natural patterning of the birds was used as the basis for phase correlation-based image matching, allowing indoor or outdoor use while being non-intrusive for the birds. The accuracy of the method was quantified and shown to be sufficient for characterising the geometric parameters of interest, but with a reduction in accuracy close to the wing edge and in some localised regions. To demonstrate the method's utility, surface reconstructions are presented for a barn owl (Tyto alba) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) during three instants of gliding flight per bird. The barn owl flew with a consistent geometry, with positive wing camber and longitudinal anhedral. Based on flight dynamics theory, this suggests it was longitudinally statically unstable during these flights. The peregrine falcon flew with a consistent glide angle, but at a range of air speeds with varying geometry. Unlike the barn owl, its glide configuration did not provide a clear indication of longitudinal static stability/instability. Aspects of the geometries adopted by both birds appeared to be related to control corrections and this method would be well suited for future investigations in this area, as well as for other quantitative studies into avian flight dynamics.","keywords":"Bird flight, Stereo-photogrammetry, Flight dynamics, Flight control, Wing geometry, Tyto alba, Tyto alba, Falco peregrinus, Falco peregrinus","title":"Avian surface reconstruction in free flight with application to flight stability analysis of a barn owl and peregrine falcon","authors":"Nicholas E.

Yet, beneath the trees on the floor of Costa Rica's tropical cloud forests, the year-round sound of animal chatter never dies down. Alston's singing mice (Scotinomys teguina) carry out raucous conversations with one another as they defend territory or court a mate. Beyond that, how their back-and-forth communication operates is largely unknown. In a new study published in Science, Daniel Okobi Jr and Arkarup Banerjee in the lab of Michael Long at the New York University School of Medicine, USA, describe how male Alston's singing mice avoid interrupting each other and the brain circuit responsible for their chitchat etiquette., To test how the mice responded when a conversation started up, the team initially kept some of the rodents in isolation while recording their solo serenades. Then the scientists relocated the loners to a new home, adjacent to another mouse. However, neither mouse could see or smell the other; they could only communicate by singing. After settling in to his new abode, the team noticed that the incomer became more chatty, singing three times more than he had when there was no audience. What was more striking was how polite the mice were when exchanging words: the mouse that had just moved into the neighbourhood waited patiently until after his new neighbour finished singing and then, within a half a second, rapidly responded with his own tune. This precisely choreographed duetting suggests that singing mice actively track conversations and respond only when the social situation is appropriate., To figure out how singing mice coordinate their colloquy, the researchers investigated the motor cortex, a brain area they suspected to be responsible for polite conversation in mice, and uniquely required for speech production in humans (but not for generating other mammals’ sounds). Knowing that mice become gradually louder and produce notes of longer duration when singing, the team cooled down the motor cortex – to slow down the neural activity. This caused the mice to take longer to spit out what they had to say, but all of the notes were articulated just fine. In contrast, stimulating the motor cortex momentarily interrupted a vocalizing mouse, after which the rodent picked up right where it left off. Lastly, when the team silenced brain activity in the motor cortex with nerve-blocking drugs, the mice still sang as often as before; however, they did not sing back in response to hearing another mouse's song. Taken together, the motor cortex in singing mice seems to be a hub for rapidly perceiving song and precisely orchestrating a vocal reply., Many creatures across the animal kingdom rely on making sounds to communicate with one another: people use language; birds twitter; Alston's mice sing. These findings from Okobi and his colleagues help extend our understanding of how vocal communication evolved in animals and the shared brain areas that enable animals to chatter, in addition to raising the question of just how quiet mice really are.","keywords":"","title":"Singing mice take turns talking","authors":"Daniel M.

Further, humans prefer to walk at speeds that approximately minimize their metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance (i.e. gross cost of transport, COT). This has been found in a variety of population groups and other species. However, these studies were mostly performed on smooth, level ground or on treadmills. We hypothesized that the objective function for walking is more complex than only minimizing the COT. To test this idea, we compared the preferred speeds and the relationships between COT and speed for people walking on both a smooth, level floor and a rough, natural terrain trail. Rough terrain presumably introduces other factors, such as stability, to the objective function. Ten healthy men walked on both a straight, flat, smooth floor and an outdoor trail strewn with rocks and boulders. In both locations, subjects performed five to seven trials at different speeds relative to their preferred speed. The COT–speed relationships were similarly U-shaped for both surfaces, but the COT values on rough terrain were approximately 115% greater. On the smooth surface, the preferred speed (1.24±0.17 m s−1) was not found to be statistically different (P=0.09) than the speed that minimized COT (1.34±0.03 m s−1). On rough terrain, the preferred speed (1.07±0.05 m s−1) was significantly slower than the COT minimum speed (1.13±0.07 m s−1; P=0.02). Because near the optimum speed the COT function is very shallow, these changes in speed result in a small change in COT (0.5%). It appears that the objective function for speed preference when walking on rough terrain includes COT and additional factors such as stability.","keywords":"Cost of transport, Stability, Optimization, Balance, Locomotion","title":"Preferred walking speed on rough terrain: is it all about energetics?","authors":"Koren Gast, Rodger Kram, Raziel Riemer","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"30 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb185447?rss=1"},{"abstract":"It is now well established that the intrauterine life environment is of major importance for health during later life.

Fatty acid desaturases, enzymes introducing double bonds into fatty acids, are crucial for the biosynthesis of these chemical signals. Δ12-desaturases catalyse the biosynthesis of linoleic acid by introducing a second double bond into oleic acid, but have been identified in only few animal species. Here we report the functional characterisation of two Δ12- desaturases, Nvit_D12a and Nvit_D12b, from the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis (Walker). We demonstrate that Nvit_D12a is expressed in the rectal vesicle of males where they produce a linoleic acid-derived sex pheromone to attract virgin females. 13C-labelling experiments with Urolepis rufipes (Ashmead), a closely related species belonging to the so-called “Nasonia-group”, revealed that females but not males are able to synthesise linoleic acid. U. rufipes males produce an isoprenoid sex pheromone in the same gland and do not depend on linoleic acid for pheromone production. This suggests that Δ12-desaturases, while common in the “Nasonia group”, acquired a specialised function in chemical communication of those species that use linoleic acid as a pheromone precursor. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that insect Δ12-desaturases have evolved repeatedly from Δ9-desaturases in different insect taxa. Hence, insects have developed a way to produce linoleic acid independent of the “Omega”-desaturase subfamily which harbours the eukaryotic Δ12-desaturases known so far.","keywords":"Parasitic wasp, Δ12-desaturase, Sex pheromone, Biosynthesis, Nasonia vitripennis, Nasonia vitripennis, Urolepis rufipes, Urolepis rufipes","title":"Functional characterisation of two Δ12-desaturases demonstrates targeted production of linoleic acid as pheromone precursor in Nasonia","authors":"Florian Semmelmann, Naoki Kabeya, Miriama Malcicka, Astrid Bruckmann, Bastian Broschwitz, Kristina Straub, Rainer Merkl, Oscar Monroig, Reinhard Sterner, Joachim Ruther, Jacintha Ellers","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"24 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.201038v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/222/9/jeb192757/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>, Antarctica is almost the last place on Earth that you would expect to be teaming with life. Survival below zero should be impossible, especially for ectothermic creatures that depend on their environment for warmth. But for the enterprising icefishes, Antarctica represented bountiful evolutionary and ecological opportunities. The icefish lineage dominates the modern Southern Ocean and its members famously sport colourless blood, huge hearts and ample mitochondria, the cell's power packs. Charmed by these unusual fish, a multinational team led by H. William Detrich III of Northeastern University, USA, John H. Postlethwait of the University of Oregon, USA, and Hyun Park from the Korea Polar Research Institute and the University of Science and Technology, Korea, investigated the genetic building blocks of extreme evolutionary adaptation in icefish., A single adult Chaenocephalus aceratus, angled from the Antarctic Peninsula, provided the raw genetic material to sequence 30,773 protein-coding genes. When comparing the new genome with those of other bony fish, the researchers found 373 gene families that were larger than expected, and 346 gene families that looked too small, revealing icefish-specific genetic quirks. Nearly 40% of these quirks appeared within the last 7 million years, coinciding with plummeting temperatures and rising oxygen levels in the ocean surrounding Antarctica. How did these 719 gene families relate to adaptation to the world's coldest marine environment?, Antifreeze glycoproteins prevent ice crystals from expanding and tearing tissues. Unsurprisingly, icefish have a respectable 23 genes for antifreeze glycoproteins and their evolutionary precursors, trypsinogen and trypsinogen-like proteases. Yet strangely, icefish embryos do not express antifreeze glycoproteins, raising the question of how these animals develop at sub-zero temperatures. The authors hypothesized that embryos rely on other glycoproteins, such as those in the zona pellucida layer around their eggs, to fulfil the antifreeze role; and the genome supported their hunch. Icefish have 131 zona pellucida genes, far more than the 16 to 35 genes found in other fishes., Another piece of the icefish adaptation puzzle is their huge stock of mitochondria and polyunsaturated fats in their muscles, to counteract the effects of cold on the fish's metabolism and biological membranes. Mitochondria naturally produce small amounts of toxic molecules that can damage DNA, fats and other cell components. The high mitochondria and polyunsaturated fat content of icefish tissues makes them extra sensitive to oxidative stress, and this shows in their genes. Icefish expanded the gene families that prevent oxidative damage, including antioxidant proteins superoxide dismutase (icefish have three extra copies) and NAD(P)H-quinone dehydrogenase (there are 33 copies in icefish, compared with between 2 and 10 in other fish). Icefish are also the only vertebrates to double up on their 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase gene, which produces a protein that removes damaged pieces of DNA., Beyond the challenges of living in the cold, making their homes so far south means icefish experience the summer ‘midnight sun’ and prolonged winter darkness. Day length guides the rhythm and expression of hundreds of genes through the circadian clock pathways. How do icefish keep time when the sun is so unreliable? Their genome suggests that they simply don't bother. The icefish genome is missing many (though not all) of the time-keeping ‘period’ and cryptochrome genes found in other fish. Apparently, such extreme fluctuations in day length made light-dependent timekeeping less useful and the genes disappeared from the genome., Somehow, 10 to 14 million years ago, life found a way. Although we have known about the peculiarities of icefish since the earliest expeditions to the remote continent, we are just starting to understand the complex genetic machinery underlying their physiology. With over 30,000 genes to mine for interesting patterns, this new high-quality genome is only the tip of the iceberg in our understanding of adaptation to extreme environments.","keywords":"","title":"Genes of the world's coolest fish","authors":"Brittney G.

But this understanding has long been used as a hallmark of advanced thinking and self-awareness for other species in the animal kingdom. Very few animals are considered self-aware, and this exclusive club is currently limited to mammals including chimpanzees, elephants and dolphins, as well as one bird species. However, researchers from universities in Japan, Switzerland and Germany have suggested that a small tropical fish – the cleaner wrasse – might also be a part of this elite group of thinkers, or perhaps the mirror test is somewhat flawed…, The mirror test typically works like this. First, an animal is shown a mirror. Next, a researcher removes the mirror and places a distinct mark somewhere on the animal's body that could only be seen with the help of a mirror. The mirror is then returned, and the researcher observes whether the animal attempts to remove the mark. Seems simple enough. Passing this test tells us that the animal understands that the reflection is itself, and no fish has ever passed it. But Masanori Kohda and colleagues thought that the cleaner wrasse might be able to. The fish are called cleaner wrasse because they munch parasites from the skin of other fish, or clients, and they are known for having the social intelligence to navigate their cleaner–client relationships. Kohda wondered whether this social intelligence might extend to self-recognition., The researchers tested the wrasse in several phases. First, they left the fish unmarked and recorded how the individuals responded to a mirror. Having never seen a mirror before, the fish attacked – how did another wrasse get in my tank?! But this anger quickly subsided and shifted to something stranger. The fish began moving in ways that had never before been recorded for this species. For instance, they would swim upside-down towards the mirror or rush at it, only to stop right before crashing into it. The team of scientists interpreted these oddities as ‘contingency behaviours’, meaning the fish were exploring their bodies and may be testing whether their reflection would follow suit if they behaved weirdly., Finally, the researchers marked the fish. They started by adding a small injection of clear paint under the scales (a common method for marking fish) to make sure the marking procedure itself did not indicate to the fish they had been marked; it didn't. The fish only inspected the mark in the mirror when the coloured paint was added. Amazingly, the fish would then leave the mirror and try to scrape off the mark by brushing themselves against the sand in their tanks. According to the rules of the mirror test, the wrasses passed., However, the team has not been quick to declare that cleaner wrasses are self-aware. Instead, they conclude that these fish must have some level of self-recognition; whether this extends to a fully realized ‘sense of self’ remains to be seen. Perhaps self-awareness exists on a continuum, instead of being either present or absent, and the mirror test may not capture these nuances. The researchers know that their findings are controversial; the prevailing view among biologists has long been that fish have few advanced cognitive abilities. Kohda's team hopes that their work will encourage others to think carefully about the methods we use to compare intelligence across species. They also point out that we need to re-evaluate our preconceived notions about fish: they may be much smarter than we give them credit for.","keywords":"","title":"Are fish self-aware?","authors":"Erin McCallum","origin":"OUTSIDE JEB","pub_date":"30 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb192781?rss=1"},{"abstract":"<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/222/9/jeb192799/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>, Physiologists are fascinated by the link between animal form and function. Some try to understand how animals use this link to adapt to their changing environments, while others have made it their career goal to uncover how an animal has evolved a specific function. But what if that evolutionary road is not as clear, perhaps because there are missing links in the evolutionary tree and competing theories about how that animal has come to be the way it is today? Or, what if an animal is so different from the rest that it is difficult to tell how it relates to other groups of animals?, Undeterred by such challenges, Tetsuto Miyashita, working out of University of Chicago, Illinois, USA, and University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada, along with an international group of researchers from two different continents, set out to resolve the evolutionary history of a very peculiar creature: the hagfish. It is the only animal to have a skull, but no vertebral column or spine – even though it is classified as a vertebrate – and it produces slime when threatened. Miyashita and his colleagues investigated the creature from a unique perspective by studying the features of a hagfish fossil (Tethymixine tapirostrum) from the Late Cretaceous period found in Lebanon, which they obtained from the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in South Dakota, USA. To add to their challenge, the team tried to reconcile two competing theories about the place of the hagfish in the evolutionary history of the vertebrates: (1) that hagfish are a primitive group of vertebrates, or (2) that they are a separate, specialized group of vertebrates all-together., Using a sophisticated technique for studying minerals in soft tissues, called synchrotron rapid-scanning X-ray fluorescence (SRS XRF), the authors examined the gill and mouth structures of the fossil. Because the fossil lacked paired fins, jaws, a mineral skeleton and features such as an oral sucker, cartilage and dorsal fin, the researchers concluded that it was not an ancestor of either the eel or the lamprey, which are similar; it was certainly a hagfish fossil. Next, the authors examined the fossil's slime glands, which are unique to hagfish. The group determined that it had 133 glands on the right side, which is more than most living hagfishes, but the animal was smaller in size. Using complex statistical analysis and historical data on the structure and evolution of lampreys and eels, the team was then able to assign the hagfish fossil to its rightful place in the evolutionary history of vertebrates. They classified it as the missing link between the last common ancestor of all vertebrates and the living soft-bodied round-mouthed fishes, thus filling a 100 million year gap in evolution., Miyashita and his colleagues’ study is revolutionary, because it shows that features such as lack of vertebral column and the round mouth of living hagfishes, which were previously believed to be primitive, are actually quite specialized, and these ancient animals seem to have evolved new adaptive features, such as their slime glands. The team's findings appear to agree with the second theory about the location of the hagfishes in the tree of life, classifying them as a specialized group rather than a primitive vertebrate. In addition, the team of researchers propose that the last common ancestor of all vertebrates is not a soft-bodied hagfish-like animal, as is the current theory. However, what that animal is, what it looked like and how closely it relates to the modern animals we see today awaits discovery.","keywords":"","title":"The vertebrate story lies in the fossil of a slimy fish","authors":"Oana Birceanu","origin":"OUTSIDE JEB","pub_date":"30 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb192799?rss=1"},{"abstract":"In animals that experience interactions with conspecifics while young, social interactions appear to be a necessary prerequisite for typical behaviour.

We confined day­-old adult workers into three different size groups (1, 8 or 32 bees) for 6 days during a critical period associated with adult behavioural maturation.

However, given the lack of evidence supporting direct sensing and/or regulation of the COM, it remains unclear whether COM mechanics are prioritized in the control scheme of walking. We posit that peripheral musculoskeletal structures, e.g. muscle, are more realistic control targets than the COM, given their abundance of sensorimotor receptors and ability to influence whole-body energetics. As a first test of this hypothesis, we examined whether conservation of stance-phase joint mechanics is prioritized over COM mechanics in a locomotor task where simultaneous conservation of COM and joint mechanics is not feasible: imposed leg-length asymmetry. Positive joint mechanical cost of transport (work per distance traveled; COTJNT) was maintained at values closer to normal walking than COM mechanical cost of transport (COTCOM; P<0.05, N=15). Furthermore, compared with our measures of COM mechanics (COTCOM, COM displacement), joint-level variables (COTJNT, integrated total support moment) also displayed stronger conservation (less change from normal walking) when the participants' self-selected gait was assessed against other possible gait solutions. We conclude that when walking humans are exposed to an asymmetric leg-length perturbation, control of joint mechanics is prioritized over COM mechanics. Our results suggest that mechanical and metabolic effort is likely regulated via control of peripheral structures and not directly at the level of the COM. Joint mechanics may provide a more accurate representation of the underlying locomotor control targets and may prove advantageous in informing predictive models of human walking.","keywords":"Cost of transport, Locomotion, Inverted pendulum, Joint, Control, Prioritization","title":"Is conservation of center of mass mechanics a priority in human walking?

But what if our world were a single leaf on a single apple tree? Would a heat wave affect us in the same way that it would affect bigger animals and their ecosystems? Sylvain Pincebourde and Jérôme Casas from Université de Tours, France, had an inkling that for itsy bitsy beasts, not all microclimates are created equal. To find out, they delved into the diminutive world of plant-eating mites and insects to see whether these critters can beat the heat., How does one study the microcosm of animals that are only a few millimetres long? Very carefully, taking all environmental factors into account. Pincebourde and Casas chose six species with three different methods of feeding on leaves: two aphids (phloem feeding; phloem is a sugar- and mineral-rich form of sap), a leaf miner (leaf mining), and two spider mites and a lace bug (tissue piercing). First, the authors determined the thermal tolerance limits of each species – or how much heat the critters can handle – by finding their upper lethal temperatures, the temperature at which 50% of the individuals die. They then studied the microclimate on the surface of the leaves by measuring the carbon dioxide intake, water loss and temperature of intact leaves and leaves that had been fed upon by the tiny herbivores. Finally, the authors combined their data on the species’ temperature limits and the leaves’ surface environment to predict just how much heat each species can handle in the wild., Each species had a different thermal tolerance and, incredibly, the upper temperatures that creatures living on the same plant could withstand varied by 8.5°C. The tissue piercers (spider mites and lace bug) could endure higher temperatures than the phloem feeders (aphids), and the leaf miner sat in between. The phloem feeders increased the leaf transpiration rate – that is, they increased the amount of water vapour leaving microscopic holes in the leaf called stomata – while the tissue piercers decreased transpiration a little and the leaf miner was once again in the middle. Importantly, the duo found that the creatures’ ability to withstand heat is directly related to leaf transpiration., By increasing leaf transpiration rates, the phloem feeders, which have the lowest thermal tolerance, were able to minimise the temperature increase of the microclimate surrounding the leaf. This means that they can stay cooler than the species that reduce leaf transpiration and allow leaves to warm. The problem with this strategy is that the phloem feeders cannot handle high temperatures because they have adapted to living in a relatively cool environment, so heat waves may spell more trouble for them than tissue piercers, which live on a relatively hot leaves. The authors’ take-home message is that after taking leaf microclimate into account, spider mites, lace bugs, aphids and leaf miners only have a safety margin of 2–3°C, as half the species were already at risk of overheating at the highest temperature (37°C) tested by the scientists., Mites and insects are likely to be more vulnerable to extreme temperatures than previously thought, and species living in temperate areas may find themselves in serious thermal strife during heat waves. Pincebourde and Casas reveal that current warming tolerances could be overestimated by up to 12°C – an enormous problem for accurately predicting future survival. Additionally, animals with different feeding apparatuses may be at different risks from climate change. It appears that creatures that turn on the air conditioning might not survive as well those that like to live with the windows open.","keywords":"","title":"It's a small world on a hot leaf","authors":"James M.

This cardiac response can place a convective limitation on systemic oxygen delivery at high temperatures. To test the hypothesis that autonomic cardiac regulation protects cardiac performance in rainbow trout during acute warming, we investigated adrenergic and cholinergic regulation during the onset and progression of cardiac limitations. We explored the direct effects of adrenergic stimulation by acutely warming an in situ working perfused heart until arrhythmia occurred, cooling the heart to restore rhythmicity and rewarming with increasing adrenergic stimulation. Adrenergic stimulation produced a clear, dose-dependent increase in the temperature and peak fH achieved prior to the onset of arrhythmia. To examine how this adrenergic protection functions in conjunction with cholinergic vagal inhibition in vivo, rainbow trout fitted with ECG electrodes were acutely warmed in a respirometer until they lost equilibrium (CTmax) with and without muscarinic (atropine) and β-adrenergic (sotalol) antagonists. Trout exhibited roughly equal and opposing cholinergic and adrenergic tone on fH that persisted up to critical temperatures. β-Adrenergic blockade significantly lowered peak fH by 14–17%, while muscarinic blockade significantly lowered the temperature for peak fH by 2.0°C. Moreover, muscarinic and β-adrenergic blockers injected individually or together significantly reduced CTmax by up to 3°C, indicating for the first time that cardiac adrenergic stimulation and cholinergic inhibition can enhance acute heat tolerance in rainbow trout at the level of the heart and the whole animal.","keywords":"Upper thermal tolerance, Autonomic regulation, Heart rate, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Cardiac arrhythmia","title":"Autonomic cardiac regulation facilitates acute heat tolerance in rainbow trout: in situ and in vivo support","authors":"Matthew J.

Phenotypic plasticity was initially thought to be beneficial to an organism's physiological fitness but several alternative hypotheses have been proposed with growing empirical support. In this study, we tested the full suite of hypotheses by investigating acclimation responses of locomotor performance for nine populations of five species of sub-Antarctic weevils, using static and fluctuating temperatures. Species showed typical locomotion thermal performance curves with temperature of the maximum speed (Topt) ranging between 22.3±1.7°C (mean±s.e.m.) and 31.1±0.7°C. For most species, Topt was not affected by acclimation. For maximum speed (Umax), significant, positive effects of acclimation were found for all species except a supralittoral one. Individuals acclimated to 0°C showed much lower values than the other two acclimation treatments (15°C and fluctuating 0–15°C). Performance breadth (the index of the breadth of the curve, Tbr) typically showed little response to acclimation. None of the traits of the supralittoral species was affected by acclimation treatment. Responses to stable and fluctuating temperature treatments were similar. Our findings also revealed that the mean estimated activation energy 0.40±0.015 eV (mean±s.e.m.) was lower than for other herbivores, the category to which these weevils belong, suggesting that some form of compensation in the rate–temperature relationship may be evident. Thus, we typically found support for the ‘warmer is better’ hypothesis for acclimation of locomotor performance, although some compensation was evident.","keywords":"Acclimation, Locomotion, Thermal performance, Ectotherm, Sub-Antarctic","title":"Phenotypic plasticity in locomotor performance of a monophyletic group of weevils accords with the ‘warmer is better’ hypothesis","authors":"Anne M.

The main purpose of this experiment was to compare dynamic measures of fatigue [maximal torque (Tmax), maximal velocity (Vmax) and maximal power (Pmax)] with measures associated with maximal isometric force [isometric maximal voluntary contraction (IMVC) and maximal rate of force development (MRFD)] 10 s after different fatiguing exercises and during the recovery period (1–8 min after). Ten young men completed six experimental sessions (3 fatiguing exercises×2 types of fatigue measurements). The fatiguing exercises were: 30 s all-out intensity (AI), 10 min at severe intensity (SI) and 90 min at moderate intensity (MI). Relative Pmax decreased more than IMVC after AI exercise (P=0.005) while the opposite was found after SI (P=0.005) and MI tasks (P<0.001). There was no difference between the decrease in IMVC and Tmax after the AI exercise, but IMVC decreased more than Tmax immediately following and during the recovery from the SI (P=0.042) and MI exercises (P<0.001). Depression of MRFD was greater than Vmax after all fatiguing exercises and during recovery (all P<0.05). Despite the general definition of fatigue, isometric assessment of fatigue is not interchangeable with dynamic assessment following dynamic exercises with large muscle mass of different intensities, i.e. the results from isometric function cannot be used to estimate dynamic function and vice versa. This implies different physiological mechanisms for the various measures of fatigue.","keywords":"Maximal power output, Maximal isometric voluntary contraction, Neuromuscular fatigue assessment","title":"Fatigue and recovery measured with dynamic properties versus isometric force: effects of exercise intensity","authors":"Renata L.

Mean heart rate (fH) recovered rapidly (<24 h) from anaesthesia and operative procedures. This preceded a more gradual development of heart rate variability (HRV), with instantaneous fH increasing during each lung ventilation cycle. Atropine injection increased mean fH and abolished HRV. Complete autonomic blockade revealed a cholinergic tonus on the heart of 55% and an adrenergic tonus of 37%. Power spectral analysis of HRV identified a peak at the same frequency as ventilation. This correlation was sustained after temperature changes and it was more evident, marked by a more prominent power spectrum peak, when ventilation is less episodic. This HRV component is homologous to that observed in mammals, termed respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Evidence for instantaneous control of fH indicated rapid conduction of activity in the cardiac efferent nervous supply, as supported by the description of myelinated fibres in the cardiac vagus. Establishment of HRV 10 days after surgical intervention seems a reliable indicator of the re-establishment of control of integrative functions by the autonomic nervous system. We suggest that this criterion could be applied to other animals exposed to natural or imposed trauma, thus improving protocols involving animal handling, including veterinarian procedures.","keywords":"Cardiorespiratory interaction, Autonomic nervous system, Polyvagal theory, Myelination, Recovery","title":"Respiratory sinus arrhythmia is a major component of heart rate variability in undisturbed, remotely monitored rattlesnakes, Crotalus durissus","authors":"Pollyana V.

The ovipositors generally consist of three longitudinally connected elements, one dorsal and two ventral valves that can slide along each other. For the parasitic wasp Diachasmimorpha longicaudata, it has been shown that protraction of the ventral valves causes incurving of the ventral valves towards the dorsal one, which results in a change in probing direction. We hypothesize that this shape change is due to differences in bending stiffness along the ovipositor. Alignment of the stiff tip of the dorsal valve with a more flexible ventral S-shaped region situated just behind the tip straightens this S-bend and results in upwards rotation of the ventral tip. We show that the S-shaped region of the ventral valves has a low bending stiffness because it contains soft materials such as resilin. In contrast, the large cross-sectional area of the dorsal valve tip area probably results in a high bending stiffness. Elsewhere, the dorsal valve is less stiff than the ventral valves. Our results support the hypothesis that the interaction between the stiff dorsal valve portion and the more flexible S-shaped region co-determines the configurational tip changes required for steering the ovipositor in any desired direction along curved paths in the substrate. This provides novel insights in the understanding of steering mechanisms of the hymenopteran ovipositor, and for application in man-made probes.","keywords":"Hymenoptera, Material and structural properties, Ovipositor biomechanics, Steering mechanism","title":"Stiffness gradients facilitate ovipositor bending and spatial probing control in a parasitic wasp","authors":"Uroš Cerkvenik, Johan L. van Leeuwen, Alexander Kovalev, Stanislav N.

Streptostyly is considered relatively widespread within lizards, whereas mesokinesis has been documented only for geckos, varanids and anguids. The present study investigated cranial kinesis in the miniaturised scincid Ablepharus kitaibelii by integrating morphological and experimental data.

Cranial joints were studied with histology, which results in the first detailed description of cranial joint histology for a member of the Scincidae. Taken together, the morphological data indicate a high potential for amphikinesis and streptostyly, which was also corroborated by skull manipulations. High-speed cinematography demonstrated that mesokinesis occurs during food uptake, processing and intraoral transport cycles. Bite force measurements showed prolonged and reasonably hard biting even at large gape angles. Based on these data, we formulate a model of the amphikinetic A. kitaibelii skull mechanism, which provides an extension of Frazzetta's quadric-crank model by placing a special emphasis on metakinesis. According to this model, we hypothesise that metakinetic intracranial movements may provide a means for reducing strain in jaw adductor muscles.

These hypercapnic challenges caused an immediate reduction in arterial pH, followed by progressive compensation through a marked elevation of plasma HCO3− over the course of 72 h. There was no appreciable rise in urinary acid excretion in fish exposed to hypercapnia in water, although urine pH was reduced and ammonia excretion did increase.

However, animals inhabiting cluttered landscapes, especially predatory animals, may require substantial familiarity with foraging landscapes to forage efficiently. They may acquire such spatial familiarity with increasing age/experience, and eventually reduce their foraging effort without compromising on foraging success/efficiency. To check whether this holds for the individually foraging predatory tropical paper-wasp Ropalidia marginata, we recorded the number and duration of all foraging trips, the identity of foraged materials, and the directions of outbound and inbound flights (with respect to the nest) of known-age wasps for three consecutive days from three naturally occurring colonies; thus, we measured behavioural profiles of wasps of various ages, and not from the same wasp throughout its lifespan. Wasps increased their foraging duration rapidly until about 4 weeks of age, during which they rarely brought food, although some wasps brought building material and water. Thereafter, their foraging duration started decreasing. Nevertheless, their foraging success/efficiency in bringing food kept on increasing. With age, wasps developed individual directional preferences for outbound and inbound flights, indicating the development of spatial memory for rewarding sites. Also, the angular difference between their outbound and subsequent inbound flights gradually increased, indicating older wasps may have followed tortuous foraging routes. High investment in early life to acquire familiarity with foraging landscapes and using that later to perform efficient foraging could be an optimal strategy for individually foraging animals inhabiting feature-rich landscapes.","keywords":"Foraging strategy, Spatial learning and memory, Social hymenoptera, Evolution, Behavioural ecology","title":"Getting older, getting smarter: ontogeny of foraging behaviour in the tropical social wasp Ropalidia marginata","authors":"Souvik Mandal, Anindita Brahma","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"2 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb199844?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Tetrapod musculoskeletal diversity is usually studied separately in feeding and locomotor systems.

In this study, we compare average joint angular excursions during cyclic behaviors – chewing, walking and running – in a phylogenetic context to explore differences in the optimality criteria of these two systems. Across 111 tetrapod species, average limb-joint angular excursions during cyclic locomotion are greater and more evolutionarily labile than those of the jaw joint during cyclic chewing. We argue that these findings reflect fundamental functional dichotomies between tetrapod locomotor and feeding systems. Tetrapod chewing systems are optimized for precise application of force over a narrower, more controlled and predictable range of displacements, the principal aim being to fracture the substrate, the size and mechanical properties of which are controlled at ingestion and further reduced and homogenized, respectively, by the chewing process. In contrast, tetrapod limbed locomotor systems are optimized for fast and energetically efficient application of force over a wider and less predictable range of displacements, the principal aim being to move the organism at varying speeds relative to a substrate whose geometry and mechanical properties need not become more homogeneous as locomotion proceeds. Hence, the evolution of tetrapod locomotor systems has been accompanied by an increasing diversity of limb-joint excursions, as tetrapods have expanded across a range of locomotor substrates and environments.","keywords":"Joint-angle excursion, Locomotion, Chewing, Cyclic behavior, Phylogenetics","title":"Joint angular excursions during cyclical behaviors differ between tetrapod feeding and locomotor systems","authors":"Michael C.

We combined analyses of 3D shape and cross-sectional geometry of the tibia, with mechanical testing and bone composition assays, to compare bone strength, elastic properties and mineral composition in Longshanks mice and randomly bred controls. Our data show that, despite being more slender, cortical geometry and predicted bending strength of the Longshanks tibia were similar to controls. In whole bone bending tests, measures of bone bending strength were similar across groups; however, Longshanks tibiae were significantly more rigid, more brittle, and required less than half the energy to fracture.

These results indicate that while Longshanks bones are as strong as control tibiae, selection for increased tibia length has altered its elastic properties, possibly through changes in organic bony matrix composition. We conclude that selection for certain limb morphologies, and/or selection for rapid skeletal growth, can lead to tissue-level changes that can increase the risk of skeletal fracture, which in turn may favor the correlated evolution of compensatory mechanisms to mitigate increased fracture risk, such as delayed skeletal maturity.","keywords":"Artificial selection, Bone cross-sectional geometry, Bone stiffness, Bone strength, Longshanks mouse","title":"Selection for longer limbs in mice increases bone stiffness and brittleness, but does not alter bending strength","authors":"Miranda N.

Photo credit: Raziel Riemer., Getting off the beaten track and out into the wild is a liberating experience for anyone stuck in the treadmill of city living. But Raziel Riemer, from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel, explains that strolling along a well-paved path is a dramatically different experience from clambering across the boulder-strewn landscapes that he encounters on trails near his home. Knowing that people walk naturally at speeds where they use the least energy, Riemer recalls a ‘light bulb moment’ at the American Society of Biomechanics meeting in 2015, where he combined his passion for walking with his love of science. ‘I realised that sometimes it is more challenging to maintain my balance and not slip or fall when walking on a really rough or rocky trail. That got me wondering if and how I choose my walking speed depending on terrain’, he says. Sharing the idea with his colleague, Rodger Kram, from the University of Colorado Boulder, USA, the pair decided to test whether hikers adjust their walking speed on rocky terrain., Recruiting 10 fit student volunteers, Riemer and Koren Gast laid out a 67 m long trail through rugged landscape on the outskirts of Beer-Sheva and kitted out the hikers with a mask and gas analyser backpack to record their oxygen consumption and CO2 production, so that they could calculate the volunteers’ exertions later. Once the volunteers were comfortable with walking while wearing the mask, Gast asked them to repeat the hike at slow, comfortable and fast paces to see whether there were any differences in their energy use. ‘The terrain gave them some challenge in maintaining their stability’, says Riemer, who also asked the walkers to repeat the exercise, but this time on a level concrete path for comparison., After calculating the walkers’ metabolic rates over 124 hiking trials on the flat and more rugged terrain, Gast converted the values into the amount of energy each walker used to travel over a set distance – known as the cost of transport – and found that the walkers used 115% more energy when negotiating the rough trail than they had on level ground. In addition, the volunteers walked more slowly – at a preferred speed of 1.07 m s−1 – on the rugged route, relative to their preferred speed of 1.24 m s−1 on the flat. And when Gast plotted the walkers’ cost of transport values against the speeds at which they were walking, the U-shaped graphs showed that the volunteers walking on the rough trail moved a little more slowly than their most efficient walking speed, resulting in a slightly less efficient walk., ‘Our interpretation is that people on rough terrain consider other factors, such as stability or foot placement, and as a result they walk slower than the energetically optimal speed’, says Riemer. However, he points out that even though the volunteers were choosing to walk at a less efficient pace, the additional effort that they invested was negligible (0.5%). ‘This means that there is almost no penalty on energetics when a person takes into consideration other factors such as stability. That's a pretty smart design’, says Riemer. And he is optimistic that he can apply the lessons from watching able-bodied hikers to help older, less stable members of the community. ‘Maybe training based on our finding that walking on rough terrain challenges stability and increases effort could improve their fitness’, he suggests.","keywords":"","title":"Hikers trade speed and efficiency for stability","authors":"Kathryn Knight","origin":"INSIDE JEB","pub_date":"30 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb204222?rss=1"},{"abstract":"The energy used to move a given distance (cost of transport; CoT) varies significantly between individuals of the same species. A lower CoT allows animals to allocate more of their energy budget to growth and reproduction. A higher CoT may cause animals to adjust their movement across different environmental gradients to reduce energy allocated to movement. The aim of this project was to determine whether CoT is a repeatable trait within individuals, and to determine its physiological causes and ecological consequences. We found that CoT is a repeatable trait in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We rejected the hypothesis that mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratios) predicted CoT. We also rejected the hypothesis that CoT is modulated by temperature acclimation, exercise training or their interaction, although CoT increased with increasing acute test temperature. There was a weak but significant negative correlation between CoT and dispersal, measured as the number of exploration decisions made by fish, and the distance travelled against the current in an artificial stream. However, CoT was not correlated with the voluntary speed of fish moving against the current. The implication of these results is that CoT reflects a fixed physiological phenotype of an individual, which is not plastic in response to persistent environmental changes. Consequently, individuals may have fundamentally different energy budgets as they move across environments, and may adjust movement patterns as a result of allocation trade-offs. It was surprising that mitochondrial efficiency did not explain differences in CoT, and our working hypothesis is that the energetics of muscle contraction and relaxation may determine CoT. The increase in CoT with increasing acute environmental temperature means that warming environments will increase the proportion of the energy budget allocated to locomotion unless individuals adjust their movement patterns.","keywords":"Oxygen consumption, Temperature, Exercise, Locomotion, Acclimation, Allocation trade-off","title":"Cost of transport is a repeatable trait but is not determined by mitochondrial efficiency in zebrafish (Danio rerio)","authors":"Miki Jahn, Frank Seebacher","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"30 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb201400?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Colonization of novel habitats often requires plasticity or adaptation to local conditions. There is a critical need to maintain hydration in terrestrial environments having limited water. Atypical populations of Florida cottonmouth snakes, Agkistrodon conanti, inhabit continental islands with no permanent sources of fresh water. Here, we report investigations related to how these insular snakes maintain water balance considering the mainland conspecifics are semi-aquatic and typically associate with freshwater mesic habitats. We tested three hypotheses related to water relations of insular populations of cottonmouth snakes compared with those on the mainland. (1) Voluntary drinking of fresh water in free-ranging insular snakes should reflect a relationship to recency of rainfall more strongly than in mainland snakes. (2) Insular snakes will tolerate greater dehydration before drinking than will mainland snakes. (3) Insular snakes will avoid drinking seawater more strongly than will those from the mainland. Between 2001 and 2018, we quantitatively estimated the hydration status of 337 individual cottonmouth snakes from insular populations and 30 cottonmouth snakes from mainland Florida, as judged by the tendency of wild-caught snakes to drink fresh water immediately following capture. We found that insular cottonmouth snakes had a higher incidence of dehydration than did mainland cottonmouth snakes (64% versus 23%), and the hydration status of the insular snakes correlated with patterns of precipitation. We also determined experimentally the dehydration threshold for drinking fresh water in insular (mean±s.d. −5.64±4.3%, n=34) and mainland cottonmouth snakes (−5.74±4.5%, n=21), and these were not significantly different. Discrimination tests for drinking serially from a graded series of brackish water showed that mainland snakes did not discriminate against the highest brackish value (10.5 ppt or 30% seawater), whereas insular snakes showed a preference for <15% seawater. Naive neonates from insular and mainland cohorts behaved similarly. The preference of insular snakes for fresh water represents an important aspect of the maintenance of water balance that differs from the mainland conspecifics and is likely a habituated or adaptive response to dependence on rainfall.","keywords":"Water relations, Florida cottonmouth, Island, Drinking, Dehydration, Brackish water","title":"Water relations of an insular pit viper","authors":"Mark R.

Photo credit: Souvik Mandal., Growing up in rural India, Souvik Mandal was always fascinated by the behaviour of the animals that surrounded him. ‘I was intrigued by the “skills” which our domestic cattle, free-ranging poultry, wild birds and honey bees use to return home’, he recalls with a smile. So, when Mandal joined Raghavendra Gadagkar's lab at the Indian Institute of Science as a graduate student to work on the tropical wasp Ropalidia marginata, he was excited by the blank slate that he was offered. ‘Compared to honey bees and ants, very little was known about the landscape-scale navigation in wasps’, he says. Having discovered that the wasps are capable of learning the local landscape and using the information to return home, Mandal and Anindita Brahma, also from the Institute, wanted to understand the insect's homing strategy. As honey bees take to foraging swiftly after a brief apprenticeship, the duo wondered how the wasps’ foraging strategy develops as they age. But first the pair had to determine of the ages of all of the foragers in the nest., After identifying three candidate nests – located in fuse boxes on lampposts in the Institute campus – Mandal and Brahma stood sentry over each nest every night for 6 months to identify and mark the newly emerged foragers with unique sets of paint identification spots. ‘We basically looked for any new black-eyed wasps’, says Mandal, describing how the eyes of recently emerged wasps fade quickly during their first few days. Having established the ages of all of the foragers, the duo staked-out each nest for three consecutive days, filming the wasps' movements and recording their bearings when they departed and returned, and whether the insects were carrying construction materials, food or water. ‘We had occasional curious visitors’, says Mandal, recalling unwanted attention from humans and animals while he and Brahma attempted to keep track of the busy wasps., Recording over 4000 trips by 272 foragers, Mandal and Brahma were surprised to see that initially the youngest foragers only left the nest once or twice a day, gradually building up their stamina until they were going out as many as six times a day. The youngsters only began returning with food 2 weeks into their foraging careers, at which point they also began cutting back on the number and duration of foraging trips, increasing their foraging success and efficiency as they grew older. Mandal also analysed the direction of the wasps’ departures and it was clear that they began to specialise as they grew older, heading off in all directions early in their careers, but preferring to visit richer locations later in life. ‘This indicates that wasps probably learn and memorise the location of food availability by acquiring sufficient spatial familiarity with their foraging grounds during their early foraging phase’, says Mandal: ‘They become smarter with age’., But why are the strategies of tropical wasps and temperate bees so different? Mandal attributes the wasps’ relatively long apprenticeship to the cluttered tropical environment in which they make their homes; they rarely experience uninterrupted views that could allow them to get their bearings. And he adds that the unguided wasps pursue prey that are constantly moving, in contrast to bees, which are directed by nest mates to stationary blooms. ‘This enables us to understand how the environment in which animals evolve shapes different behaviour and strategies’, says Mandal.","keywords":"","title":"Tropical paper wasps serve long apprenticeships","authors":"Kathryn Knight","origin":"INSIDE JEB","pub_date":"2 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb204230?rss=1"},{"abstract":"<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/222/9/jeb205260/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>, Ewald R. Weibel passed away on 19 February, aged 89. His remarkable intellect remained intact even as his physical condition worsened. He continued to be fully engaged scientifically at the time of his death, in close professional contact with his longtime associates Connie Hsia (University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) and Matthias Ochs (Charité, Berlin). It will come as no surprise to those who knew him that he was preparing his ultimate research paper, finishing the draft for its Introduction just 2 weeks before his final hospitalization., Weibel's journey from his childhood home in Zurich to membership into the National Academy of Sciences was an interesting one with many unexpected turns. He came from a modest family background; his father was a typewriter mechanic. It was a financial stretch for the family to have their son studying medicine, which he did with a state stipend. When Weibel graduated, he had to find employment, as interns then rarely received a salary during their first 2 years of clinical training. Little did he know that this ‘outside employment’ would set a path on which he would remain for his entire scientific career. His job in pathology was a mandate to study the anastomosing vessels between the bronchiolar and the pulmonary circulation. In an ingenious experiment, he showed that the particular structure of these arteries, with longitudinal muscle strands in the intima, could be attributed to the stretch to which these arteries were subjected during ventilation, unrelated to their anastomosis function. This work earned him a 2 year fellowship jointly funded by the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences and the National Institutes of Health. His intention was to study the physiology of the collateral circulation in the lung in André Cournand's laboratory at Columbia University (Cournand had received the Nobel Prize in Physiology just previously in 1956). Newly wed to his supportive wife Verena, they travelled to New York by ship. After a short stint in Avriell Liebow’s laboratory at Yale, and after a successful seminar at Columbia, Weibel realized his dream and joined Cournand's team. As one might surmise, Nobel Laureates are outstanding ‘talent scouts’, and Cournand immediately offered him a laboratory and generous resources with only one requirement: ‘Do anything on the structure of the lung that is of interest to physiology’., As Weibel started his work in Cournand's laboratory, he made a crucial acquaintance. In September 1959 he met Domingo Gomez, a brilliant exiled Cuban biophysicist also working in Cournand's laboratory whose interest was modelling gas exchange in the human lung from first principles. Together, they soon realized that to do realistic modelling of gas exchange, they must rely on quantitative data on the anatomical structures relevant for gas exchange. As the lung's surface area is only anatomically accessible on thin sections of lung tissue, a serious problem had to be solved: how to make accurate estimates of physiologically relevant structural properties in three dimensions from measurements made on tissue sections in two dimensions. Aspects of this problem had previously been solved for metallurgy and geology, but these techniques had not been applied in biology. So together with Hans Elias, Weibel was an early key promoter of a branch of probabilistic geometry later to be named ‘stereology’ or ‘morphometry’. Stereological estimates of some quantitative parameters of the lung and a model of the branching pattern of the alveolar tree led Weibel and Gomez to publish a landmark paper on the architecture of the human lung., However, it soon became clear that the resolution of light microscopy was simply not good enough to resolve the intricate structure of the interface between the air space and the erythrocyte in the lung capillary to realistically model lung diffusion capacity from structural quantities. In 1961, Weibel realized that he needed the resolution power afforded by electron microscopy to obtain the structural estimates needed for physiologically relevant modelling. Fortunately for Weibel, Cournand established contacts with George Palade at Rockefeller. Palade was a pioneer of electron microscopy who went on to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1974 for his contributions in laying the structural foundation for cell biology. Weibel was thus able to learn electron microscopy, the then cutting-edge tool of biology, at Palade's laboratory. The resolution of electron microscopy allowed for structural measurements of the last step of the oxygen transfer from the air in the alveoli, through the tissue barrier and the plasma space into the red cell, as needed for the modelling efforts of Gomez., While at Rockefeller, Weibel came across peculiar tubular structures that he found in endothelial cells of a rat lung but also in endothelia of other tissues. These structures had not been described before, and with Palade he published his findings. Today these structures are known as ubiquitous markers of endothelial cells under the name of ‘Weibel–Palade bodies’. Much later, in 1982, it became known that the Weibel–Palade bodies contain, amongst other things, the von Willebrand factor, which is a key component of coagulation., By 1962, Weibel, his student visa expired, was forced to return to Switzerland. The University of Zurich offered him an assistant professorship with the task to set up the first electron microscopy unit. It was not long before Swiss universities were competing for Weibel's skills and intellect, and in 1964, at the age of 35, he accepted an offer to become the Director of the Department of Anatomy of the University of Bern. With considerable financial support of the canton of Bern, Weibel was tasked to establish a cutting-edge institution for quantitative structural research. This gamble by the University of Bern paid off big time, as this institute became the reference laboratory for quantitative structural analyses on the microscopic and electron microscopic level world-wide and is known as the nurturing ground for the development of stereology. Weibel's love for stereology had much to do with the fact that stereological measurement techniques are derived from first principles and, when done correctly, allow for obtaining unbiased estimates for volumes, surfaces, lengths and numbers of structures or compartments in biological samples. Stereological techniques are basically the only unbiased approach to assess biological properties, as the stereological tools are derived from mathematical principles. Any other assay that is used today in biology (be it biochemical or molecular) is, by necessity, biased., The main focus of the experimental work at Weibel's laboratory continued to be the gas exchange apparatus. He was keenly interested in the potential malleability of the pulmonary gas exchanger with exercise and hypoxia but also understood the value in comparative physiology. He studied the lungs of very small mammals, such as the 3 g Etruscan shrew, as well as human lungs that were collected post-mortem. In various collaborations he also made his morphometric techniques available for the study of fish gills and the lungs of birds. An important finding of these studies was that in a comparative context, pulmonary diffusing capacity, as measured by morphometric techniques, scaled in direct proportion to body mass (scaling factor 1) whereas resting oxygen consumption scaled to body mass with a scaling factor of 0.75 – an apparent discrepancy., As his pursuits grew, he never lost his interest in the nature of the Weibel–Palade bodies. So on his first sabbatical in 1975 he decided to once again join his old friend Palade, and together they used cell biological techniques to unravel the function of the tiny tubular structures in endothelia that carried his name. It turned out that this was one of the few projects that Weibel did not finish with success; a reminder of how failure is an integral part of success. Indeed, this led to a long and productive new direction., The failure to unravel the secret of the Weibel–Palade bodies gave Weibel the opportunity to meet C. Richard (‘Dick’) Taylor, a Harvard University comparative physiologist who had a gift for measuring the maximum aerobic capacity (V̇O2,max) in a number of mammalian species of different body size. The two of them decided to join forces to launch an expedition to Kenya with the aim of understanding oxygen uptake, transport and utilization across species. To do this, they measured V̇O2,max data on as many wild African species as possible and coupled those data with samples of lung and muscle morphometry from the same animals. This gigantic project was the start of a close friendship between Weibel and Taylor that lasted until Taylor's death in 1995. It was also the start of an extremely fruitful collaboration between Taylor's laboratory at the Concorde Field Station of Harvard University and the Department of Anatomy of the University of Bern. The collaboration resulted in more than 25 joint publications. The unique contributions of this research matched the maximal oxygen uptake of animals to their relevant quantitative structural features of the heart, the circulation and the skeletal muscle tissue. This body of work provided countless insights into the design of the entire respiratory cascade in mammals in a coherent quantitative frame and under limiting physiological conditions of V̇O2,max., One indisputable finding of this long collaboration was the close match between structure and function in the design of the mammalian respiratory system, linking the ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’ steps of the respiratory cascade. Weibel coined the term of ‘symmorphosis’ to denote that each step of the cascade was exactly quantitatively tuned to demand: there was enough – but not too much – structure to support oxygen flow. But he also found one apparent exception to his concept of symmorphosis – namely, the lung. The analysis indicated that there was seemingly excess lung structure in large animals. This finding continued to bother him for the rest of his career and through all of his retirement. In fact, the last manuscript he was working on dealt with this problem and the potential effect that shorter alveolar duct lengths in small animals could have on the condition of oxygen transfer between the alveolar air space and erythrocytes., Weibel will be remembered as an outstanding scientist. His articles and books cover three main areas: lung structure and function, stereology, and the design of the respiratory system. For his work, he has received a number of prestigious academic prizes such as the Marcel Benoist Prize, the Anders Retzius Medal and the Purkinje Gold Medal. He also served in many academic functions such as Rector of the University of Bern, President of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences and President of the International Union of Physiological Sciences. Above all, Weibel was an inspiration to all who had the chance of working with him. He had a piercing mind, he loved the academic battle and he hated any kind of dishonesty. It was important for him to follow and foster the career of his many collaborators. Throughout his career and as a head of the Department of Anatomy, he shouldered a full teaching load. He was a brilliant and engaging role model for all medical students and he remained proud of his first academic vocation as a medical doctor. He will be sorely missed. Ewald Weibel leaves behind his wife Verena, whom he had lovingly cared for during the final years of his life.","keywords":"","title":"Ewald R. Weibel (1929–2019)","authors":"Hans Hoppeler, Stan L.

Photo credit: Mark Sandfoss., Castaways usually meet their fate by washing ashore on a desert island, but not the cottonmouth pit vipers (Agkistrodon conanti) of the Cedar Keys, Florida. ‘Our understanding is that these islands formed in the recent past as relic sand dunes that were connected to the mainland via dry land until sea levels rose’, says Mark Sandfoss from the University of Florida, USA. And when the reptiles found themselves cut off from sources of fresh water, they really were left high and dry. ‘Cottonmouths are almost exclusively found in freshwater habitats’, explains Sandfoss; which made him and his thesis advisor, Harvey Lillywhite, wonder how the marooned serpents manage their thirst when surrounded by undrinkable seawater., ‘Harvey has been collecting drinking data on free-ranging cottonmouths for decades’, says Sandfoss, describing how Lillywhite picks up the vipers with a hook, weighs them and offers them a bowl of water to drink. He then reweighs the animals immediately after they have slaked their thirst to determine how much water they have consumed. After joining Lillywhite's lab in 2013, Sandfoss began comparing Lillywhite's observations of how likely the snakes were to drink with the amount of rainfall on the islands and found that the animals that had experienced the longest drought gulped down the largest volume, while snakes that had experienced rainfall in recent days were less eager to drink. However, when the scientists compared the island cottonmouths’ drinking habits with those of their mainland cousins, which live in swamps and rivers, 64% of the island animals were dehydrated while only 24% of their mainland cousins needed a drink. The duo realised that the island cottonmouths depend on rainwater and go thirsty between rainfalls., The scientists then wondered whether the water-deprived castaways were able to suppress their thirst more than the mainland population, so Sandfoss allowed island and mainland snakes to go thirsty and then recorded the animals’ mass when they decided that they needed a drink. ‘We found a large variation in the thirst responses of snakes from the two populations, with some snakes drinking after losing less than 2% mass while others from the same population did not drink until they had lost more than 12%’, says Sandfoss. However, when the scientists compared the two groups of animals, there was no difference in their thirst threshold, so the castaways don't seem to have altered their thirst tolerance in response to their tropical-island lifestyle., The pair then investigated how the two populations would react when offered a drink of salt water. ‘We know that even the most well-adapted sea snakes require fresh water for drinking and this made us think that insular cottonmouths would not be able to rely on seawater’, says Sandfoss. Discovering quickly that both populations turned up their noses at full-strength – and even 25% – seawater, Sandfoss then offered thirsty mainland and island cottonmouths increasingly dilute saltwater drinks and found that most of the island snakes (19) refused the salty drinks: only 7 chanced a sip. However, the mainland cottonmouths were far less discriminating, with 6 sipping the saltiest (30%) water and only 7 holding off until they were offered fresh water. Also, when the duo compared the water preferences of newborns, it seemed that the island youngsters had inherited their parents’ aversion to salt water., Castaway cottonmouths have evolved the ability to detect and avoid drinking seawater, even though the prospect may seem tempting when the rains fail, but do not supress their thirst, and Sandfoss is keen to find out how the marooned snakes sniff out the difference between fresh and salt water when feeling parched.","keywords":"","title":"Castaway cottonmouths depend on rain to slake thirst","authors":"Kathryn Knight","origin":"INSIDE JEB","pub_date":"8 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb205526?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Heath MacMillan is an Assistant Professor at Carleton University, Canada, where he studies the physiological mechanisms limiting ectotherm performance.

Photo credit: Eve Robinson., When a predatory fish prepares to strike at an unsuspecting victim, it twists its body into a deadly S-shape, ready to straighten instantaneously as it lunges forward. But as any parent knows, it can take a while for youngsters to get to grips with feeding themselves, and fish larvae are no exception. Although some lack the speed and accuracy to intercept a moving target, opting for a more sedentary diet until their coordination improves, others manage to seize passing snacks successfully despite their diminutive size. Yet it was unclear whether these feisty larvae follow in their parents’ S-shaped footsteps, or tread a different path to snap up their prey. Intrigued by the possibility that the larvae that target live dinners do something different from mum and dad, Lillian Tuttle, Eve Robinson, Mary Fashingbauer, Daniel Hartline and Petra Lenz from the Pacific Biosciences Research Center, Hawaii, USA, with Rudi Strickler from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, USA, decided to catch clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris) larvae in the act of pouncing on scrumptious plankton to find out how their attacks unfurl as they age., After rearing minute freshly hatched clownfish newborns in the lab, Robinson offered the hungry larvae – ranging in age from 1–5, 6–9 to 11–14 days old – the chance to strike at nippy home-grown copepods while she and Strickler filmed the youngsters’ high-speed lunges. ‘It was challenging to film microscopic interactions between a freely swimming fish larva and a copepod while keeping both in focus’, chuckles Robinson, adding that Strickler's camera system was perfectly designed to follow the larvae's strikes with high precision., When Fashingbauer painstakingly digitised the larvae's postures as they curled their bodies in preparation for a strike, it was clear that instead of coiling into a curvy S, they twisted their rear ends into a general J-shape; the youngest (∼5.5 mm long) larvae struck a question-mark-shaped pose, while the oldest pulled a looser hockey stick-shaped posture, bending their tails to one side before striking at a passing copepod. Analysing the youngsters’ manoeuvres in fine detail, Fashingbauer and Tuttle could also see that the oldest larvae (6.7–10.3 mm long) were able to accelerate up to speeds of 240 mm s−1, while the youngest and smallest larvae still managed a respectable 160 mm s−1, capturing their copepod treats in 9 ms. In addition, Tuttle and Lenz realised that the stealthy hunters depend on their pectoral fins to stabilise their body position by wafting them to and fro alternately as they creep forward before unleashing their powerful tail beat, unlike anchovy larvae, which continue beating their tails until the final push. Also, the youngest clownfish larvae appeared to target the youngest plankton larvae, whereas the more mature larvae graduated to consuming adult copepods., ‘The combination of the clownfish's extreme J-shaped posture and alternate sculling of its pectoral fins likely minimises disturbance during its predatory approach while precisely aligning it with the prey’, says Tuttle, explaining that the copepods are worthy adversaries, capable of making a rapid escape when they sense an approaching larva. And she suspects that the clownfish's lopsided strategy may represent one example of many possible alternative strategies adopted by larval fish in their progression to adulthood.","keywords":"","title":"Clownfish larvae J-curl to catch copepods","authors":"Kathryn Knight","origin":"INSIDE JEB","pub_date":"9 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb206177?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Honeybees use visual and olfactory cues to detect flowers during foraging trips. Hence, the reward association of a nectar source is a multimodal construct which has at least two major components – olfactory and visual cues.

The present study used stimulation with UV, blue and green light to evoke distinct photoreceptor activities in the compound eye and two odour components (Geraniol, Citronellol). To test if a compound of both modalities is perceived as the sum of its elements (elemental processing) or as a unique cue (configural processing) we combined monochromatic light with single odour components in positive (PP) and negative patterning (NP) experiments. During PP, the compound of two modalities was rewarded, whereas the single elements were not. For NP, stimuli comprising a single modality were rewarded, whereas the olfactory-visual compound was not. Furthermore, we compared the differentiation abilities between two light stimuli with and without being part of an olfactory-visual compound.

Although thermal developmental plasticity has been studied in Drosophila for several traits, it is not entirely clear how it affects reproductive fitness. We, therefore, investigated how developmental temperature affects reproductive performance (early fecundity and egg-to-adult viability) of wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster. We have tested competing hypotheses on the character of developmental thermal plasticity using a full factorial design with three developmental and adulthood temperatures within the natural thermal range of this species. To account for potential intraspecific differences, we examined flies from tropical (India) and temperate (Slovakia) climate zones. Our results show that flies from both populations raised at intermediate developmental temperature (25°C) have comparable or higher early fecundity and fertility at all tested adulthood temperatures, while lower (17°C) or higher developmental temperatures (29°C) did not entail any advantage under the tested thermal regimes. Importantly, the superior thermal performance of flies raised at 25°C is apparent even after taking two traits positively associated with reproductive output into account – body size and ovariole number. Thus, in Drosophila melanogaster, development at a given temperature does not necessarily provide any advantage at this thermal environment in terms of reproductive fitness. Our findings strongly support the optimal developmental temperature hypothesis which claims that at different thermal environments the highest fitness is achieved when an organism is raised at its optimal developmental temperature.","keywords":"Developmental plasticity, Acclimation, Drosophila, Drosophila, Fecundity, Viability, Ovariole number, Body size","title":"Reproductive fitness of Drosophila is maximised by optimal developmental temperature","authors":"Peter Klepsatel, Thirnahalli Nagaraj Girish, Heinrich Dircksen, Martina Gáliková","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"7 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.202184v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"The diamondback terrapin is the only temperate turtle species that exclusively inhabits estuarine habitats. Morphological, behavioral and physiological features contribute to the terrapin's ability to regulate body fluid osmotic pressure in a euryhaline environment. Low integument permeability combined with aquatic-terrestrial shuttling behavior limits passive exchange of water and salts with the environment, and terrapins regulate active uptake of salts via alterations in drinking and feeding behavior. The lachrymal salt gland facilitates excretion of excess sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions through active transport mechanisms. We investigated body fluid dynamics, oxygen consumption (V̇O2), and osmotic status of terrapins exposed to an acute increase in salinity (12 to 35 psu) at 10°C and 25°C to gain insight into the relative importance of behavioral vs. physiological osmoregulatory adjustments over a range of seasonally-relevant temperatures. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of experimental temperature, salinity, and mass. Overall, temperature effects were stronger than salinity effects. Terrapins acclimated to 25°C had significantly lower blood osmolality and Na+, and higher water turnover rates, daily water flux (DWF), and V̇O2 compared with terrapins acclimated to 10°C. Salinity effects were restricted to DWF, which significantly decreased in response to acute exposure to 35 psu. Our results support the notion that behavioral adjustments predominate in the osmoregulatory strategy of terrapins.","keywords":"Osmoregulation, Energetics, Oxygen consumption, Salt gland, Water balance, Reptile","title":"Effects of temperature and salinity on body fluid dynamics and metabolism in the estuarine Diamond-backed Terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin)","authors":"Amanda Southwood Williard, Leigh Anne Harden, T.

This paper explores the behaviour of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle and its tendinous tissue during gait, as it absorbs energy during contact and controls foot position during swing. Simultaneous measurements of ultrasound, surface electromyography and 3-dimensional motion capture with musculoskeletal modelling from twelve healthy participants were recorded as they walked at preferred and fast walking speeds. We quantified the length changes and velocities of the TA muscle-tendon unit and its fascicles across the stride at each speed. Fascicle length changes and velocities were relatively consistent across speeds, although the magnitude of fascicle length change differed between the deep and superficial regions. At contact, when the TA is actively generating force, the fascicles remained relatively isometric as the MTU actively lengthened, presumably stretching the TA tendinous tissue and absorbing energy. This potentially protects the muscle fibres from damage during weight acceptance and allows energy to be returned to the system later in the stride. During early swing the fascicles and MTU both actively shortened to dorsiflex the foot, clearing the toes from the ground; although, at the fast walking velocity the majority of the shortening occurred through tendinous tissue recoil, highlighting its role in accelerating ankle dorsi-flexion to power rapid foot clearance in swing.","keywords":"Tibialis anterior, Walking, Ultrasound, Energy absorption","title":"Tibialis anterior tendinous tissue plays a key role in energy absorption during human walking","authors":"Jayishni N.

MTs of caterpillars are notably complex and consist of several regions that display prominent differences in ion transport. The distal ileac plexus (DIP) is a region of Malpighian tubule that is of particular interest because it switches from ion secretion to ion reabsorption in larvae fed on ion-rich diets. The pathways of solute transport in the DIP are not well understood, but one potential route is the paracellular pathway between epithelial cells. This pathway is regulated by the septate junctions (SJs) in invertebrates, and in this study, we found regional and cellular heterogeneity in expression of several integral SJ proteins. DIP of larvae fed ion-rich diets demonstrated a reduction in paracellular permeability, coupled with alterations in both SJ morphology and the abundance of its molecular components. Similarly, treatment in vitro with helicokinin (HK), an antidiuretic hormone identified by previous studies, altered mRNA abundance of many SJ proteins and reduced paracellular permeability. HK was also shown to target a secondary cell-specific SJ protein Tsp2A. Taken together, our data suggest that dietary ion loading, known to cause ion transport reversal in the DIP of larval T. ni, leads to alterations in the paracellular permeability, SJ morphology and its molecular component abundance. The results suggest that HK is an important endocrine factor that co-regulates ion transport, water transport and paracellular permeability in MTs of larval lepidopterans. We propose that co-regulation of all three components of the MT function in larval lepidopterans allows for safe toggling between ion secretion and reabsorption in the DIP in response to variations in dietary ion availability.","keywords":"Septate junctions, Malpighian tubules, Lepidoptera, Ion transport reversal, Paracellular permeability","title":"Septate junction in the distal ileac plexus of larval lepidopteran Trichoplusia ni: alterations in paracellular permeability during ion transport reversal","authors":"Dennis Kolosov, Sima Jonusaite, Andrew Donini, Scott P.

This can be achieved using several cues, including binocular stereoscopic cues such as changing disparity and interocular velocity differences, and monocular cues such as looming. While these have been studied in detail in humans, only looming responses have been well characterized in insects and we know nothing about the role of stereo cues and how they might interact with looming cues. We used our 3D insect cinema in a series of experiments to investigate the role of the stereo cues mentioned above, as well as looming, in the perception of motion-in-depth during predatory strikes by the praying mantis Sphodromantis lineola. Our results show that motion-in-depth does increase the probability of mantis strikes but only for the classic looming stimulus, an expanding luminance edge. Approach indicated by radial motion of a texture or expansion of a motion-defined edge, or by stereoscopic cues, all failed to elicit increased striking. We conclude that mantises use stereopsis to detect depth but not motion-in-depth, which is detected via looming.","keywords":"Changing disparity, Interocular velocity differences, Looming, Mantis, Predation, Stereopsis","title":"Motion-in-depth perception and prey capture in the praying mantis Sphodromantis lineola","authors":"Vivek Nityananda, Coline Joubier, Jerry Tan, Ghaith Tarawneh, Jenny C.

One of the driving forces responsible for alterations in brain morphology is increasing environmental complexity that may demand for enhanced cognitive abilities (e.g. attention, memory and learning). However, studies looking at the relationship between brain morphology and learning are scarce. Here, we tested the effects of both learning and environmental enrichment on neural plasticity in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), by means of either a reversal-learning test or a spatial-learning test. Given considerable evidence supporting environmentally-induced plastic alterations, two separate control groups that were not subjected to any cognitive test were included to account for potential changes induced by the experimental setup alone. We did not find any effect of learning on any of our brain measurements. However, we found strong evidence for an environmental effect, where fish given access to the spatial-learning environment had larger relative brain size and optic tectum size in relation to those exposed to the reversal-learning environment. Our results demonstrate the plasticity of the adult brain to respond adaptively mainly to environmental conditions, providing support for the environmental enhancement theory.","keywords":"Brain plasticity, Cognition, Reversal learning, Spatial learning","title":"Plastic changes in brain morphology in relation to learning and environmental enrichment in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata)","authors":"Stephanie Fong, Séverine D.

In the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), the coordinated activity of the Malpighian tubules and anterior midgut maintains water and ion balance during the post-prandial diuresis. Three to four hours after the meal the diuretic process finishes, and the animal enters an antidiuretic state to ensure water conservation until the next blood intake. The diuretic and antidiuretic processes are tightly regulated by serotonin and neuropeptides in this insect. In the present work, we report that the neuropeptide precursor CCHamide 2 is involved in the regulation of the post-prandial diuresis in the kissing bug R. prolixus. Our results suggest a dual effect of RhoprCCHamide2 peptide, enhancing the serotonin-induced secretion by Malpighian tubules, and inhibiting serotonin-induced absorption across the anterior midgut. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a hormone presenting opposite effects in the two osmoregulatory organs (i.e. midgut and Malpighian tubules) in insects, probably reflecting the importance of a well-tuned diuretic process in hematophagous insects during different moments after the blood meal.","keywords":"Insect, Anterior midgut, Malpighian tubules, Chagas disease, Hematophagy","title":"The neuropeptide CCHamide 2 regulates diuresis in the Chagas’ disease vector Rhodnius prolixus","authors":"Natalia Capriotti, Juan P.

However, the amount of water absorbed by the vesicles and which other ions apart from sodium are transported remain unknown. Using Orchesella cincta as a model, we developed protocols for two assays that enabled us to study water and ion movement across the eversible vesicles in whole living springtails.

Consequently, mainly natural selection is considered to have shaped the attachment system in relation to weight load and substrate. However, sexual selection may also be important because many animals attach to the partner during mating. Both hypotheses generate opposing predictions in species where males are smaller than females. Natural selection predicts the attachment ability to scale positively with load, and hence body size, and so be larger in females than males. Sexual selection predicts attachment forces in males to be larger than females, despite the males’ smaller size because males benefit from uninterrupted copulation by stronger attachment to the female. We tested these predictions in the common bedbug Cimex lectularius, a species in which both sexes, as well as nymphs, regularly carry large loads, blood meals of up to three times the body weight. By measuring attachment forces to smooth surfaces and analysing in-situ fixed copulating pairs and the morphology of attachment devices, we show i) that males generate twice the attachment force of females, although weighing 15 % less, ii) that males adhere to females during copulation using hairy tibial adhesive pads, iii) more setae, and more setae per unit area, in the pads of males than females but no difference in shape of tarsal setae, and iv) the absence of hairy tibial attachment pads and low attachment force in nymphs. These results are consistent with a sexually selected function of attachment in bedbugs. Controlling sperm transfer and mate guarding by attaching to females during copulation may also shape the evolution of male attachment structures in other species. More generally, we hypothesise the existence of arms races of male attachment structures and female counterparts to impede attachment which may result in a similar evolutionary diversification as male genitalia.","keywords":"Adhesive setae, Centrifugal force test, Fossulae spongiosa, Resilin, Safety factor, Sexual conflict, Tibial setae","title":"Evidence for a sexually selected function of the attachment system in bedbugs Cimex lectularius (Heteroptera, Cimicidae)","authors":"Klaus Reinhardt, Dagmar Voigt, Stanislav N.

Infection by S. carpocapsae significantly up-regulated Vg mRNA expression in the male body. The corresponding increase in Vg protein expression was also confirmed by electrophoretic and immunoblotting analyses. Remarkably, in females, the tendency was opposite. Nematodal infection significantly reduced both Vg mRNA and Vg protein expression levels in fat body and hemolymph, respectively. We speculate that infection of reproductive females reduces Vg expression to the level, which is still sufficient for defense, but insufficient for reproduction. This circumstance reduces energy expenditure and helps the individual to cope with the infection. Importantly, purified Vg significantly inhibited growth of Xenorhabdus spp., an entomotoxic bacteria isolated from S. carpocapsae. However, the effect of Vg against I. fumosorosea was not so obvious. The fungus significantly stimulated Vg gene expression in males, however, a similar increase was not recapitulated on the protein level. Nevertheless, in females, both mRNA and protein Vg levels were significantly reduced after the fungal infection.

Hypoxia increased the relative volumes of air and blood capillaries, structures directly involved in gas exchange, while decreased the relative volumes of atria in both groups of chicks, and the parabronchial lumen in older chicks. Accordingly, the surface area of the air capillaries and the anatomical diffusion factor were increased under hypoxic incubation. Treatment did not alter total lung volume, relative volumes of infundibula, bronchi, Bv, It, or the tissue barrier of any group.

We manipulated the yolk concentrations of vitamin E and corticosterone, which are the main antioxidants and, respectively, the main glucocorticoid hormone in bird eggs, both independently and simultaneously and we tested their separate and combined effects on growth and oxidative status in the liver and in the brain of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) embryos.

Vitamin E did not affect embryo growth when administered alone. We further analyzed independent and combined effects of vitamin E and corticosterone on liver and brain total antioxidant capacity, concentration of reactive oxygen molecules and lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E significantly reduced liver total antioxidant capacity, while corticosterone depressed brain lipid peroxidation. Prenatal exposure to vitamin E and corticosterone appears to have antagonistic effects on body growth, although vitamin E is not limiting in yellow-legged gull eggs. In combination with the results of previous experiments on the same species applying smaller experimental doses or focusing on the post-natal rather than pre-natal life stages, our findings indicate that the effects of a physiological increase in the egg concentrations of these substances can be life stage- and dose-specific, implying that generalizing prenatal effects of egg compounds may not be feasible.","keywords":"Corticosterone, Embryo growth, Yellow-legged gull, Oxidative status, Vitamin E","title":"Prenatal independent and combined effects of yolk vitamin E and corticosterone on embryo growth and oxidative status in the yellow-legged gull","authors":"Marco Parolini, Cristina Daniela Possenti, Simona Secomandi, Silvia Carboni, Manuela Caprioli, Diego Rubolini, Andrea Romano, Nicola Saino","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"1 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.199265v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Insect pheromones are often derived from fatty acid metabolism. Fatty acid desaturases, enzymes introducing double bonds into fatty acids, are crucial for the biosynthesis of these chemical signals. Δ12-desaturases catalyse the biosynthesis of linoleic acid by introducing a second double bond into oleic acid, but have been identified in only few animal species. Here we report the functional characterisation of two Δ12- desaturases, Nvit_D12a and Nvit_D12b, from the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis (Walker). We demonstrate that Nvit_D12a is expressed in the rectal vesicle of males where they produce a linoleic acid-derived sex pheromone to attract virgin females. 13C-labelling experiments with Urolepis rufipes (Ashmead), a closely related species belonging to the so-called “Nasonia-group”, revealed that females but not males are able to synthesise linoleic acid. U. rufipes males produce an isoprenoid sex pheromone in the same gland and do not depend on linoleic acid for pheromone production. This suggests that Δ12-desaturases, while common in the “Nasonia group”, acquired a specialised function in chemical communication of those species that use linoleic acid as a pheromone precursor. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that insect Δ12-desaturases have evolved repeatedly from Δ9-desaturases in different insect taxa. Hence, insects have developed a way to produce linoleic acid independent of the “Omega”-desaturase subfamily which harbours the eukaryotic Δ12-desaturases known so far.","keywords":"Parasitic wasp, Δ12-desaturase, Sex pheromone, Biosynthesis, Nasonia vitripennis, Nasonia vitripennis, Urolepis rufipes, Urolepis rufipes","title":"Functional characterisation of two Δ12-desaturases demonstrates targeted production of linoleic acid as pheromone precursor in Nasonia","authors":"Florian Semmelmann, Naoki Kabeya, Miriama Malcicka, Astrid Bruckmann, Bastian Broschwitz, Kristina Straub, Rainer Merkl, Oscar Monroig, Reinhard Sterner, Joachim Ruther, Jacintha Ellers","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"24 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.201038v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Unlike vertebrates, the penaeid shrimp stomach is of ectodermic origin and is thus covered by a cuticle that is sloughed upon molting. It is composed of two chambers, here called the anterior and posterior stomach chambers, ASC and PSC respectively. The PSC contains a filtration structure variously called a pyloric filter, filter press, gastric filter or gastric sieve (GS) and the latter will be used here. The GS resembles an elongated, inverted-V, dome-like, chitinous structure with a midline ridge that is integral to the ventral base of the PSC. The dome surface is covered with a carpet-like layer of minute, comb-like setae bearing laterally-branching setulae. This carpet serves as a selective filter that excludes large partially-digested food particles but allows smaller particles and soluble materials to enter hepatopancreatic ducts that conduct them into the shrimp hepatopancreas (HP) where further digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place. Although the GS function is well known, its exclusion limit for particulate material has not been clearly defined. Using histological and ultra-structure analysis, we show that the GS sieve pore diameter is approximately 0.2-0.7 μm in size, indicating a size exclusion limit (SEL) of substantially less than 1 μm.

This has been found in a variety of population groups and other species. However, these studies were mostly performed on smooth, level ground or on treadmills. We hypothesized that the objective function for walking is more complex than only minimizing the COT. To test this idea, we compared the preferred speeds and the relationships between COT and speed for people walking on both a smooth, level floor and a rough, natural terrain trail. Rough terrain presumably introduces other factors, such as stability, to the objective function. Ten healthy men walked on both a straight, flat, smooth floor and an outdoor trail strewn with rocks and boulders. In both locations, subjects performed five to seven trials at different speeds relative to their preferred speed. The COT–speed relationships were similarly U-shaped for both surfaces, but the COT values on rough terrain were approximately 115% greater. On the smooth surface, the preferred speed (1.24±0.17 m s−1) was not found to be statistically different (P=0.09) than the speed that minimized COT (1.34±0.03 m s−1).

Because near the optimum speed the COT function is very shallow, these changes in speed result in a small change in COT (0.5%).

We tested the hypothesis that colonization of germ-free chicks from a quail line selected for a high emotional reactivity (E+) with GM from a line with low emotional reactivity (E-) would reduce their emotional behaviour in comparison with germ-free chicks from E+ line colonized with GM from the same E+ line. The GM composition analysis of both groups revealed a shift in term of microbial diversity and richness between Day 21 and Day 35 and the GM of the two groups of quails were closer to each other at Day 35 than at Day 21 at a phylum level. Quails that received GM from the E- line expressed a lower emotional reactivity than the quails colonized by GM from the E+line in the tonic immobility and the novel environment tests proceeded during the second week of age. This result was reversed in a second tonic immobility test and an open-field run two weeks later. These behavioural and GM modifications over time could be the consequence of the resilience of the GM to recover its equilibrium present in the E+ host, which is in part driven by the host genotype.

Although many first-feeding fish larvae strike at non-evasive prey using an S-start, the clownfish Amphiprion ocellaris feeds on highly evasive calanoid copepods from a J-shaped position, beginning 1 day post-hatch (dph). We quantified this unique strike posture by observing successful predatory interactions between larval clownfish (1 to 14 dph) and three developmental stages of the calanoid copepod Bestiolina similis. The J-shaped posture of clownfish became less tightly curled (more L-shaped) during larval development. Larvae were also less tightly curled when targeting adult copepods, which are more evasive than younger copepod stages. Strike performance measured as time to capture and as peak speed improved only slightly with larval age. Therefore, the J-posture may allow first-feeding larvae to minimize disturbance during their approach of sensitive prey, and may represent an alternative predatory strategy to the prototypical S-start.","keywords":"Fast-start, Predation, Evasive prey, S-start, Kinematics","title":"Predatory posture and performance in a precocious larval fish targeting evasive copepods","authors":"Mary C.

Their wing geometry is characterised by complex variation in parameters such as camber, twist, sweep and dihedral. To characterise this complexity, a multi-view stereo-photogrammetry setup was developed for accurately measuring surface geometry in high resolution during free flight. The natural patterning of the birds was used as the basis for phase correlation-based image matching, allowing indoor or outdoor use while being non-intrusive for the birds. The accuracy of the method was quantified and shown to be sufficient for characterising the geometric parameters of interest, but with a reduction in accuracy close to the wing edge and in some localised regions. To demonstrate the method's utility, surface reconstructions are presented for a barn owl (Tyto alba) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) during three instants of gliding flight per bird. The barn owl flew with a consistent geometry, with positive wing camber and longitudinal anhedral. Based on flight dynamics theory, this suggests it was longitudinally statically unstable during these flights. The peregrine falcon flew with a consistent glide angle, but at a range of air speeds with varying geometry. Unlike the barn owl, its glide configuration did not provide a clear indication of longitudinal static stability/instability. Aspects of the geometries adopted by both birds appeared to be related to control corrections and this method would be well suited for future investigations in this area, as well as for other quantitative studies into avian flight dynamics.","keywords":"Bird flight, Stereo-photogrammetry, Flight dynamics, Flight control, Wing geometry, Tyto alba, Tyto alba, Falco peregrinus, Falco peregrinus","title":"Avian surface reconstruction in free flight with application to flight stability analysis of a barn owl and peregrine falcon","authors":"Nicholas E.

Eusocial insects have large colonies where individuals experience a large number of social interactions with nest mates during all life stages, making them excellent candidates for understanding the effects of social isolation on brain development and behaviour. Here, we used the honey bee Apis mellifera to study the effect of social isolation and group size on reward perception and discrimination learning and memory. We confined day­-old adult workers into three different size groups (1, 8 or 32 bees) for 6 days during a critical period associated with adult behavioural maturation. We quantified their sucrose responsiveness, their ability to use and remember olfactory cues to discriminate between sucrose and salt (i.e. discrimination learning), and four biogenic amines in the brain. We found that the smaller the group size, the more responsive a worker was to the sucrose reward. Honey bees raised in groups of 32 performed the best in the learning trials and had the highest levels of dopamine. We found no effect of group size on memory. The observed group size effect on learning but not memory supports the hypothesis that social interactions modulate learning through the dopaminergic system.","keywords":"Social behaviour, Eusociality, Social isolation, Biogenic amines, Dopamine, Social interactions","title":"Effects of group size on learning and memory in the honey bee Apis mellifera","authors":"Nadejda Tsvetkov, Chelsea N.

This cardiac response can place a convective limitation on systemic oxygen delivery at high temperatures. To test the hypothesis that autonomic cardiac regulation protects cardiac performance in rainbow trout during acute warming, we investigated adrenergic and cholinergic regulation during the onset and progression of cardiac limitations. We explored the direct effects of adrenergic stimulation by acutely warming an in situ working perfused heart until arrhythmia occurred, cooling the heart to restore rhythmicity and rewarming with increasing adrenergic stimulation. Adrenergic stimulation produced a clear, dose-dependent increase in the temperature and peak fH achieved prior to the onset of arrhythmia. To examine how this adrenergic protection functions in conjunction with cholinergic vagal inhibition in vivo, rainbow trout fitted with ECG electrodes were acutely warmed in a respirometer until they lost equilibrium (CTmax) with and without muscarinic (atropine) and β-adrenergic (sotalol) antagonists. Trout exhibited roughly equal and opposing cholinergic and adrenergic tone on fH that persisted up to critical temperatures. β-Adrenergic blockade significantly lowered peak fH by 14–17%, while muscarinic blockade significantly lowered the temperature for peak fH by 2.0°C. Moreover, muscarinic and β-adrenergic blockers injected individually or together significantly reduced CTmax by up to 3°C, indicating for the first time that cardiac adrenergic stimulation and cholinergic inhibition can enhance acute heat tolerance in rainbow trout at the level of the heart and the whole animal.","keywords":"Upper thermal tolerance, Autonomic regulation, Heart rate, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Cardiac arrhythmia","title":"Autonomic cardiac regulation facilitates acute heat tolerance in rainbow trout: in situ and in vivo support","authors":"Matthew J.

Mean heart rate (fH) recovered rapidly (<24 h) from anaesthesia and operative procedures. This preceded a more gradual development of heart rate variability (HRV), with instantaneous fH increasing during each lung ventilation cycle. Atropine injection increased mean fH and abolished HRV. Complete autonomic blockade revealed a cholinergic tonus on the heart of 55% and an adrenergic tonus of 37%. Power spectral analysis of HRV identified a peak at the same frequency as ventilation. This correlation was sustained after temperature changes and it was more evident, marked by a more prominent power spectrum peak, when ventilation is less episodic. This HRV component is homologous to that observed in mammals, termed respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Evidence for instantaneous control of fH indicated rapid conduction of activity in the cardiac efferent nervous supply, as supported by the description of myelinated fibres in the cardiac vagus. Establishment of HRV 10 days after surgical intervention seems a reliable indicator of the re-establishment of control of integrative functions by the autonomic nervous system.

However, given the lack of evidence supporting direct sensing and/or regulation of the COM, it remains unclear whether COM mechanics are prioritized in the control scheme of walking. We posit that peripheral musculoskeletal structures, e.g. muscle, are more realistic control targets than the COM, given their abundance of sensorimotor receptors and ability to influence whole-body energetics. As a first test of this hypothesis, we examined whether conservation of stance-phase joint mechanics is prioritized over COM mechanics in a locomotor task where simultaneous conservation of COM and joint mechanics is not feasible: imposed leg-length asymmetry. Positive joint mechanical cost of transport (work per distance traveled; COTJNT) was maintained at values closer to normal walking than COM mechanical cost of transport (COTCOM; P<0.05, N=15). Furthermore, compared with our measures of COM mechanics (COTCOM, COM displacement), joint-level variables (COTJNT, integrated total support moment) also displayed stronger conservation (less change from normal walking) when the participants' self-selected gait was assessed against other possible gait solutions. We conclude that when walking humans are exposed to an asymmetric leg-length perturbation, control of joint mechanics is prioritized over COM mechanics. Our results suggest that mechanical and metabolic effort is likely regulated via control of peripheral structures and not directly at the level of the COM. Joint mechanics may provide a more accurate representation of the underlying locomotor control targets and may prove advantageous in informing predictive models of human walking.","keywords":"Cost of transport, Locomotion, Inverted pendulum, Joint, Control, Prioritization","title":"Is conservation of center of mass mechanics a priority in human walking?

Species showed typical locomotion thermal performance curves with temperature of the maximum speed (Topt) ranging between 22.3±1.7°C (mean±s.e.m.) and 31.1±0.7°C. For most species, Topt was not affected by acclimation. For maximum speed (Umax), significant, positive effects of acclimation were found for all species except a supralittoral one. Individuals acclimated to 0°C showed much lower values than the other two acclimation treatments (15°C and fluctuating 0–15°C). Performance breadth (the index of the breadth of the curve, Tbr) typically showed little response to acclimation. None of the traits of the supralittoral species was affected by acclimation treatment. Responses to stable and fluctuating temperature treatments were similar. Our findings also revealed that the mean estimated activation energy 0.40±0.015 eV (mean±s.e.m.) was lower than for other herbivores, the category to which these weevils belong, suggesting that some form of compensation in the rate–temperature relationship may be evident.

The ovipositors generally consist of three longitudinally connected elements, one dorsal and two ventral valves that can slide along each other. For the parasitic wasp Diachasmimorpha longicaudata, it has been shown that protraction of the ventral valves causes incurving of the ventral valves towards the dorsal one, which results in a change in probing direction. We hypothesize that this shape change is due to differences in bending stiffness along the ovipositor. Alignment of the stiff tip of the dorsal valve with a more flexible ventral S-shaped region situated just behind the tip straightens this S-bend and results in upwards rotation of the ventral tip. We show that the S-shaped region of the ventral valves has a low bending stiffness because it contains soft materials such as resilin. In contrast, the large cross-sectional area of the dorsal valve tip area probably results in a high bending stiffness. Elsewhere, the dorsal valve is less stiff than the ventral valves. Our results support the hypothesis that the interaction between the stiff dorsal valve portion and the more flexible S-shaped region co-determines the configurational tip changes required for steering the ovipositor in any desired direction along curved paths in the substrate. This provides novel insights in the understanding of steering mechanisms of the hymenopteran ovipositor, and for application in man-made probes.","keywords":"Hymenoptera, Material and structural properties, Ovipositor biomechanics, Steering mechanism","title":"Stiffness gradients facilitate ovipositor bending and spatial probing control in a parasitic wasp","authors":"Uroš Cerkvenik, Johan L. van Leeuwen, Alexander Kovalev, Stanislav N.

Ten young men completed six experimental sessions (3 fatiguing exercises×2 types of fatigue measurements). The fatiguing exercises were: 30 s all-out intensity (AI), 10 min at severe intensity (SI) and 90 min at moderate intensity (MI). Relative Pmax decreased more than IMVC after AI exercise (P=0.005) while the opposite was found after SI (P=0.005) and MI tasks (P<0.001). There was no difference between the decrease in IMVC and Tmax after the AI exercise, but IMVC decreased more than Tmax immediately following and during the recovery from the SI (P=0.042) and MI exercises (P<0.001). Depression of MRFD was greater than Vmax after all fatiguing exercises and during recovery (all P<0.05).

These hypercapnic challenges caused an immediate reduction in arterial pH, followed by progressive compensation through a marked elevation of plasma HCO3− over the course of 72 h. There was no appreciable rise in urinary acid excretion in fish exposed to hypercapnia in water, although urine pH was reduced and ammonia excretion did increase. In the air-exposed fish, however, hypercapnia was attended by a large elevation of ammonia in the urine and a large rise in titratable acid excretion.

Impaired shivering thermogenesis (ST) could be due to the mutated titin protein causing more compliant muscles. We hypothesized that non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) is impaired. To characterize the response to cold exposure, we measured Tb and metabolic rate (MR) of WT and mdm mice at four nominal temperatures: 20, 24, 29 and 34°C.

NST capacity was lower in mdm mice than in WT mice. Using MR data from a previous study, we compared MR of mdm mice with MR of Perognathus longimembris, a mouse species of similar body mass. Our results indicated low MR and reduced NST of mdm mice. These were more pronounced than differences between mdm and WT mice owing to body mass effects on MR and capacity for NST. Correcting MR using Q10 showed that mdm mice had lower MRs than size-matched P. longimembris, indicating that mutated N2A titin causes severe thermoregulatory defects at all levels.

Streptostyly is considered relatively widespread within lizards, whereas mesokinesis has been documented only for geckos, varanids and anguids. The present study investigated cranial kinesis in the miniaturised scincid Ablepharus kitaibelii by integrating morphological and experimental data.

High-speed cinematography demonstrated that mesokinesis occurs during food uptake, processing and intraoral transport cycles. Bite force measurements showed prolonged and reasonably hard biting even at large gape angles. Based on these data, we formulate a model of the amphikinetic A. kitaibelii skull mechanism, which provides an extension of Frazzetta's quadric-crank model by placing a special emphasis on metakinesis.

However, animals inhabiting cluttered landscapes, especially predatory animals, may require substantial familiarity with foraging landscapes to forage efficiently. They may acquire such spatial familiarity with increasing age/experience, and eventually reduce their foraging effort without compromising on foraging success/efficiency. To check whether this holds for the individually foraging predatory tropical paper-wasp Ropalidia marginata, we recorded the number and duration of all foraging trips, the identity of foraged materials, and the directions of outbound and inbound flights (with respect to the nest) of known-age wasps for three consecutive days from three naturally occurring colonies; thus, we measured behavioural profiles of wasps of various ages, and not from the same wasp throughout its lifespan. Wasps increased their foraging duration rapidly until about 4 weeks of age, during which they rarely brought food, although some wasps brought building material and water. Thereafter, their foraging duration started decreasing. Nevertheless, their foraging success/efficiency in bringing food kept on increasing. With age, wasps developed individual directional preferences for outbound and inbound flights, indicating the development of spatial memory for rewarding sites. Also, the angular difference between their outbound and subsequent inbound flights gradually increased, indicating older wasps may have followed tortuous foraging routes. High investment in early life to acquire familiarity with foraging landscapes and using that later to perform efficient foraging could be an optimal strategy for individually foraging animals inhabiting feature-rich landscapes.","keywords":"Foraging strategy, Spatial learning and memory, Social hymenoptera, Evolution, Behavioural ecology","title":"Getting older, getting smarter: ontogeny of foraging behaviour in the tropical social wasp Ropalidia marginata","authors":"Souvik Mandal, Anindita Brahma","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"2 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb199844?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Optical detection of horizontally polarized light is widespread among aquatic insects.

We found that CoT is a repeatable trait in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We rejected the hypothesis that mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratios) predicted CoT. We also rejected the hypothesis that CoT is modulated by temperature acclimation, exercise training or their interaction, although CoT increased with increasing acute test temperature. There was a weak but significant negative correlation between CoT and dispersal, measured as the number of exploration decisions made by fish, and the distance travelled against the current in an artificial stream. However, CoT was not correlated with the voluntary speed of fish moving against the current. The implication of these results is that CoT reflects a fixed physiological phenotype of an individual, which is not plastic in response to persistent environmental changes. Consequently, individuals may have fundamentally different energy budgets as they move across environments, and may adjust movement patterns as a result of allocation trade-offs. It was surprising that mitochondrial efficiency did not explain differences in CoT, and our working hypothesis is that the energetics of muscle contraction and relaxation may determine CoT. The increase in CoT with increasing acute environmental temperature means that warming environments will increase the proportion of the energy budget allocated to locomotion unless individuals adjust their movement patterns.","keywords":"Oxygen consumption, Temperature, Exercise, Locomotion, Acclimation, Allocation trade-off","title":"Cost of transport is a repeatable trait but is not determined by mitochondrial efficiency in zebrafish (Danio rerio)","authors":"Miki Jahn, Frank Seebacher","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"30 April 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb201400?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Colonization of novel habitats often requires plasticity or adaptation to local conditions. There is a critical need to maintain hydration in terrestrial environments having limited water. Atypical populations of Florida cottonmouth snakes, Agkistrodon conanti, inhabit continental islands with no permanent sources of fresh water. Here, we report investigations related to how these insular snakes maintain water balance considering the mainland conspecifics are semi-aquatic and typically associate with freshwater mesic habitats. We tested three hypotheses related to water relations of insular populations of cottonmouth snakes compared with those on the mainland. (1) Voluntary drinking of fresh water in free-ranging insular snakes should reflect a relationship to recency of rainfall more strongly than in mainland snakes. (2) Insular snakes will tolerate greater dehydration before drinking than will mainland snakes. (3) Insular snakes will avoid drinking seawater more strongly than will those from the mainland. Between 2001 and 2018, we quantitatively estimated the hydration status of 337 individual cottonmouth snakes from insular populations and 30 cottonmouth snakes from mainland Florida, as judged by the tendency of wild-caught snakes to drink fresh water immediately following capture. We found that insular cottonmouth snakes had a higher incidence of dehydration than did mainland cottonmouth snakes (64% versus 23%), and the hydration status of the insular snakes correlated with patterns of precipitation. We also determined experimentally the dehydration threshold for drinking fresh water in insular (mean±s.d. −5.64±4.3%, n=34) and mainland cottonmouth snakes (−5.74±4.5%, n=21), and these were not significantly different. Discrimination tests for drinking serially from a graded series of brackish water showed that mainland snakes did not discriminate against the highest brackish value (10.5 ppt or 30% seawater), whereas insular snakes showed a preference for <15% seawater. Naive neonates from insular and mainland cohorts behaved similarly. The preference of insular snakes for fresh water represents an important aspect of the maintenance of water balance that differs from the mainland conspecifics and is likely a habituated or adaptive response to dependence on rainfall.","keywords":"Water relations, Florida cottonmouth, Island, Drinking, Dehydration, Brackish water","title":"Water relations of an insular pit viper","authors":"Mark R.

The results showed that corticotrophin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, dopamine, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations in all ammonia-N groups increased significantly between 3 and 12 h. Cortisol increased significantly between 3 and 24 h. All hormones except crustacean hyperglycemic hormone were reduced to control levels. mRNA abundance of guanylyl cyclase increased significantly during the experiment. Dopamine receptor D4 and α2 adrenergic receptor mRNA abundance in treatments decreased significantly at the beginning, and eventually returned to the control level, whereas mRNA abundance of the 5-HT7 receptor increased significantly only within the first 12 h. Changes in protein kinase (PKA, PKG) mRNA abundance were similar to the patterns of biogenic amines and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone, peaking at 6 and 12 h, respectively, whereas PKC mRNA abundance decreased within 24 h. 14-3-3 protein, FXYD2 and cAMP-response element binding protein mRNA abundance increased significantly and peaked at 6 h. β-catenin and T-cell factor mRNA abundance increased significantly throughout the experiment and peaked at 12 h. The upregulation of Rh protein, K+ channel, Na+/K+-ATPase, V-type H+-ATPase and vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) mRNA, together with downregulation of Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter mRNA, indicated an adjustment of general branchial ion-/ammonia-regulatory mechanisms. Meanwhile, hemolymph ammonia concentration was significantly increased in most ammonia-N exposure groups. Histological investigation revealed the hepatopancreatic damage caused by ammonia-N. Results suggest that hormones, biogenic amines and Wnt/β-catenin play a principal role in adapting to ammonia-N exposure and facilitating ammonia transport.","keywords":"Ammonia transport, Neuroendocrine, Hormone, Biogenic amine, Protein kinase, Hepatopancreas damage","title":"Ammonia-N exposure alters neurohormone levels in the hemolymph and mRNA abundance of neurohormone receptors and associated downstream factors in the gills of Litopenaeus vannamei","authors":"Lingjun Si, Luqing Pan, Hongdan Wang, Xin Zhang","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"8 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/222/9/jeb200204?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Tetrapod musculoskeletal diversity is usually studied separately in feeding and locomotor systems. However, comparisons between these systems promise important insight into how natural selection deploys the same basic musculoskeletal toolkit – connective tissues, bones, nerves and skeletal muscle – to meet the differing performance criteria of feeding and locomotion. In this study, we compare average joint angular excursions during cyclic behaviors – chewing, walking and running – in a phylogenetic context to explore differences in the optimality criteria of these two systems. Across 111 tetrapod species, average limb-joint angular excursions during cyclic locomotion are greater and more evolutionarily labile than those of the jaw joint during cyclic chewing. We argue that these findings reflect fundamental functional dichotomies between tetrapod locomotor and feeding systems. Tetrapod chewing systems are optimized for precise application of force over a narrower, more controlled and predictable range of displacements, the principal aim being to fracture the substrate, the size and mechanical properties of which are controlled at ingestion and further reduced and homogenized, respectively, by the chewing process. In contrast, tetrapod limbed locomotor systems are optimized for fast and energetically efficient application of force over a wider and less predictable range of displacements, the principal aim being to move the organism at varying speeds relative to a substrate whose geometry and mechanical properties need not become more homogeneous as locomotion proceeds. Hence, the evolution of tetrapod locomotor systems has been accompanied by an increasing diversity of limb-joint excursions, as tetrapods have expanded across a range of locomotor substrates and environments.","keywords":"Joint-angle excursion, Locomotion, Chewing, Cyclic behavior, Phylogenetics","title":"Joint angular excursions during cyclical behaviors differ between tetrapod feeding and locomotor systems","authors":"Michael C.

These tend to differ among species with different modes of locomotion, reflecting their unique loading patterns. The evolution of derived limb morphologies, such as the long limbs associated with jumping, may compromise overall bone strength. We evaluated bone mechanical properties in the Longshanks mouse, which was selectively bred for increased tibia length relative to body mass. We combined analyses of 3D shape and cross-sectional geometry of the tibia, with mechanical testing and bone composition assays, to compare bone strength, elastic properties and mineral composition in Longshanks mice and randomly bred controls. Our data show that, despite being more slender, cortical geometry and predicted bending strength of the Longshanks tibia were similar to controls. In whole bone bending tests, measures of bone bending strength were similar across groups; however, Longshanks tibiae were significantly more rigid, more brittle, and required less than half the energy to fracture. Tissue-level elastic properties were also altered in Longshanks mice, but the bones did not differ from the control in water content, ash content or density. These results indicate that while Longshanks bones are as strong as control tibiae, selection for increased tibia length has altered its elastic properties, possibly through changes in organic bony matrix composition. We conclude that selection for certain limb morphologies, and/or selection for rapid skeletal growth, can lead to tissue-level changes that can increase the risk of skeletal fracture, which in turn may favor the correlated evolution of compensatory mechanisms to mitigate increased fracture risk, such as delayed skeletal maturity.","keywords":"Artificial selection, Bone cross-sectional geometry, Bone stiffness, Bone strength, Longshanks mouse","title":"Selection for longer limbs in mice increases bone stiffness and brittleness, but does not alter bending strength","authors":"Miranda N.
