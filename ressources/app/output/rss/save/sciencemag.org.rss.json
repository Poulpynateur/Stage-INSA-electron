[{"abstract":"Top CRISPR researchers at two University of California (UC) campuses have teamed up with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to form a new laboratory in San Francisco that will exploit the genome editor to screen for new drugs.\n\nDrawing on a GSK commitment of $67 million over 5 years, UC Berkeley’s Jennifer Doudna, a co-inventor of the powerful CRISPR tool, and UC San Francisco’s Jonathan Weismann will select the academic talent to work in the new Laboratory for Genomics Research (LGR). “This is really, for us as academics, kind of a dream come true,” says Doudna.\n\nAlthough Doudna already has co-founded two CRISPR-related companies and co-runs the Innovative Genomic Institute with Weissman, she says the LGR “takes the not very interesting parts of the screening efforts out of the picture.” A friend who visited her lab a few years ago described it as “artisanal,” she recalls, and wondered why they weren’t using more automation. “It was a nice way of saying that it seems really fusty,” says Doudna. She hopes the LGR will let them use “genome editing and CRISPR, in particular, as a tool to understand the causes of disease in a way that had really never been possible in the past.”, Weissman, a physicist who morphed into a protein-folding specialist, specializes in using CRISPR to construct large-scale probes of gene functions. “We don’t have the capability, the knowledge, or the resources to develop drugs,” he says. “I'm trying to understand what are the problems that [GSK is] facing and what are the tools that would really solve the problem. As a tool builder, my biggest fear is we build a bridge to nowhere.”\n\nIn all, the London-based GSK will fund 24 full-time UC research¬ers—only some of whom will come from Doudna and Weissman’s labs. GSK will contribute as many as 14 of its own employees. UC will own the intellectual property (IP) of any new tools invented in the lab, while GSK hopes to patent new drug targets. UC will receive a “financial benefit if a drug that requires licensed IP comes to market,” says a GSK spokesperson, noting that the exact terms are “confidential.”\n\nHal Barron, GSK’s chief scientific officer says 90% of genes still have opaque functions. He hopes that by using CRISPR to knock out or turn on genes in cells and animal models, the LGR will be able to double the number of genes with known functions.  “Think about the impact of that as being able to develop twice as many drugs,” Barron says.\n\nOther academics who have had similar partnerships said they are useful, but can be tricky as well. “Overall, the model is great and the [CRISPR] space is ripe for innovation that’s not fundamental biology or chemistry but an engineering problem,” says UC San Francisco’s Jeffrey Bluestone, an immunologist who for the past 9 years has taken part in a collaboration between the school and Pfizer. The one challenge, he said, is there can be a “disconnect” when there’s a discovery about a potential drug that targets a disease not in the company’s portfolio.\n\nThe Harvard Stem Cell Institute took part in a collaboration with GSK between 2008 and 2013 to develop new drug targets for regenerative medicine. “It was a really great interaction,” says Harvard stem cell biologist David Scadden, who notes it ended because GSK got out of the regenerative medicine business. “Having academics who are bilingual in terms of understanding how companies have to think as they develop products is a good thing,” he says.\n\nThe lab, located at UC San Francisco’s Mission Bay campus, already is up and running.","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/CRISPR_16x9_0.jpg?itok=P2K_W4KB","title":"University of California CRISPR researchers form drug discovery alliance with pharma giant","authors":"Jon Cohen","pub_date":"Jun. 13, 2019 , 6:15 AM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/university-california-crispr-researchers-form-drug-discovery-alliance-pharma-giant"},{"abstract":"Nearly one in five employees of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) who responded to a recent survey say they experienced gender harassment while at work during the previous 12 months, according to an interim report the biomedical agency has just posted online. A large number also reported being targets of unwelcome sexual attention. The survey, which elicited responses from about 16,000 NIH employees, was conducted between January and March., The Interim Executive Report on the NIH Workplace Climate and Harassment Survey will be presented and discussed at tomorrow’s semiannual meeting of the Advisory Committee to the Director of NIH, Francis Collins. The final analysis of the survey data, the most ambitious of its kind that the agency has conducted, isn’t expected until late this year at the earliest., The report is part of a larger NIH effort to address sexual harassment and other forms of harassment both on its Bethesda, Maryland, campus and among its thousands of university-based grantees., NIH sent the survey to 36,228 valid email addresses, including employees of some NIH contractors, and got 15,794 responses, for a response rate of 44%., Overall, 21.6% of respondents said they had experienced harassment, with women reporting higher rates of harassment than men—26.9% versus 12%. Fully 44.8% of transgender staff and those with other gender identities reported harassment., The most commonly reported type of harassment, experienced by 18%, was gender harassment—popularly known as put-downs rather than come-ons. Just over 10% reported experiencing unwanted sexual attention; 0.3% reported being coerced for sex., Nearly half of respondents who reported experiencing harassment did not tell anyone about the event. If they did, they mostly told a co-worker rather than filing an official complaint., Among those who didn’t report their harassment, 77.4% said they refrained from doing so because the experience wasn’t serious enough to merit that step. Of those who did report their harassment to anyone, including a co-worker, 7.1% knew with certainty that their complaint was investigated; 2.2% said they knew the perpetrator was punished., “This report provides further evidence that we have work to do in order to make good on our determination that ‘harassment doesn’t work here,’” Collins wrote to NIH employees today in an email., The number of NIH employees who reported being harassed is strikingly lower than the up to 50% of female science, technology, engineering, and math students at universities who reported being harassed by faculty or staff in a landmark report last summer by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The 12-month time limit on the NIH’s reporting period may contribute to the lower rate at the biomedical agency, the report suggests., Update, 12 June 2019, 6:35 p.m.: This story has been updated to clarify that the nearly one in five survey respondents said they had experienced gender harassment within the past year. Overall, more than one in five reported some form of harassment.","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/NIH_building_1-1280x720.jpg?itok=hzmq8GXz","title":"Nearly one in five NIH employees say they experienced gender harassment in the past year","authors":"Meredith Wadman","pub_date":"Jun. 12, 2019 , 5:30 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/nearly-one-five-nih-employees-say-they-experienced-gender-harassment-past-year"},{"abstract":"Tumors release cells into the blood that can reveal that the cancer is growing and spreading to other parts of the body. Now, researchers have shown they can train a laser device on the hand of a skin cancer patient and detect these scarce tumor cells coursing through the bloodstream. The device could one day improve screening for the cancer melanoma. It could also help doctors monitor whether treatments are working, and even curb the original tumor’s spread by zapping the roaming cells., “It’s fascinating that it’s possible to detect these circulating tumor cells literally through the skin,” says medical oncologist Klaus Pantel of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany, who was not involved in the study. But he and others caution that much work remains to show the device will help people with melanoma., Most researchers who are working on ways to detect circulating cancer cells (CTCs) look for them in blood drawn from a person. In people with advanced breast, colon, or prostate cancer, doctors can order a commercial test that counts CTCs in such a blood sample. But these approaches often can’t pick up the few cells released by early cancers, and they don’t work for melanoma because its cells don’t sport the main surface marker that the tests use to detect CTCs., Hoping to improve on other methods, a team led by biomedical engineer Vladimir Zharov of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock coupled a laser with an ultrasound detector to create what they dubbed the “Cytophone”—because the device detects cells acoustically. (“Cyto” means cell.) When they shine the Cytophone’s laser on an animal’s or person’s skin so that its light penetrates a few millimeters into near-surface blood vessels, any passing melanoma cells slightly heat up because of their dark pigment, melanin. This harmless heating creates a tiny acoustic wave that gets picked up by the ultrasound detector., When Zharov’s team focused its device on a person’s hand for a few seconds to 1 hour and looked for signals against background noise from abundant, less energy-absorbing red blood cells, they detected no CTCs in 19 healthy volunteers. But in 27 of 28 melanoma patients, CTCs showed up as spikes., The Cytophone can pick up a single CTC in 1 liter of blood, which is up to 1000 times more sensitive than other detection methods that probe for CTCs in a typical 7.5-milliliter blood sample, the team reports today in Science Translational Medicine. The device also detected small blood clots with the potential to grow and kill a cancer patient., In an intriguing twist, when the researchers turned the laser to a higher but still safe energy level, they also showed that a patient’s CTC levels came down over the hour because the device was apparently destroying the cells, without causing any side effects. Although that’s unlikely to wipe out a person’s cancer altogether—the original tumor or metastatic tumors will keep releasing the cells—the Cytophone could be used to enhance the effects of a cancer drug, Zharov says., The device could be used to follow whether an anticancer drug is working—if it is, a patient’s CTC levels should go down, says Zharov, who with his colleagues has patented the Cytophone and launched a company to develop it further. “You could monitor periodically every 3 months and see if the melanoma comes back.” It could also be used as an add-on to skin checks to improve screening for melanoma, like a mammogram for breast cancer, he suggests. And Zharov pictures using it to detect or monitor other cancer types by tagging patients’ CTCs with gold nanoparticles that, like melanin, would cause the cells to heat up., But Pantel and others caution that those applications are a long way off. For one thing, the team only tested three patients with early stage melanoma. “They’re going to have to show they can find [CTCs] in early stage patients” by testing a much larger number, says oncologist Anthony Lucci of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas., The researchers also need to explore whether the Cytophone can find CTCs in patients with darker skin—their higher levels of melanin in normal cells could make it hard for the Cytophone to distinguish any cancer cells, says mechanical engineer Shannon Stott of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. For now, she says, “It is a very cool study with lots of promise.”","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/Galanzha_16x9.jpg?itok=rFYpV33W","title":"Laser detects tumor cells in bloodstream, potentially improving melanoma screening and treatment","authors":"Jocelyn Kaiser","pub_date":"Jun. 12, 2019 , 2:00 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/laser-detects-tumor-cells-bloodstream-potentially-improving-melanoma-screening-and"},{"abstract":"A federal advisory panel today called on the Department of the Interior (DOI) to keep access to the imagery from its long-running Landsat satellite program free and open. Any effort to collect fees for such data would generate little money and would actively damage the U.S. remote sensing industry, the panel said in a report., The Landsat program, which began in 1972 and is managed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has produced the world’s longest-running series of satellite images, documenting the vast global changes caused by humanity over the past 47 years. Two Landsat satellites are now in orbit, taking 1200 images a day at a 30-meter resolution. In 2008, USGS stopped charging for use of Landsat images, creating a surge of academic research, along with users in government and industry. The move created about $2 billion in annual economic benefits, according to estimates from earlier this decade. The Landsat annual budget, meanwhile, is about $80 million., In 2017, DOI asked its National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC) to evaluate the possibility of once again imposing charges for using Landsat data, among other approaches to raising revenue. The move, when reported last year, was met with an outcry from scientists in the United States and abroad, along with federal and state agencies and nonprofits running a diverse range from the Wyoming state engineer to the Global Forest Observations Initiative. “The community was very vocal regarding the value of a free and open data policy,” said Frank Avila, a remote-sensing scientist at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in Springfield, Virginia, who leads the NGAC subcommittee that authored the report approved today., The NGAC report echoes those sentiments, according to a presentation by Kevin Pomfret, a lawyer at Williams Mullen in Tysons, Virginia, who led the NGAC study and specializes in remote sensing. An effort to charge for Landsat data would largely drive users to free alternatives offered by the Europeans, while still costing the government a significant sum to run. The net result would be a drain on the U.S. economy, the study said. “Charging a fee for Landsat data will result in negative economic impacts,” Pomfret said at the meeting, and “would not be worth the economic, legal, societal, or political costs.”, The report also explores whether USGS, which runs Landsat, might instead keep the core Landsat data free, while charging for “value-added” imagery or specialized tasks carried out by the satellites. Such a move might raise revenue, the report says, but it could also require substantial regulatory or legal changes. Similarly, money could potentially be saved by hiring a contractor who could more efficiently manage digital access to the Landsat data, but USGS must study this idea more closely., If DOI is concerned about the cost of the Landsat program, the report concludes, it would be better served by looking at how to reduce the cost of the satellites themselves, rather than attempting to reap revenue from their data. Although the next Landsat satellite, the ninth in the series, is set for a launch in December 2020, USGS and its partners, including NASA, are mulling what the future of the program should look like, especially given the rise of competitors such as the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellites and commercial constellations like Planet. A study on the program’s future architecture is due later this year., Although the NGAC report was approved unanimously by the panel’s members and will be available online this week, it is ultimately up to DOI to decide whether it will go through with any fees, says Timothy Newman, program coordinator for national land imaging at USGS. But given the report and the nearly universal negative reaction to charging fees, he says, “The reality is that I just don’t see it happening.”","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/landsat_16x9.jpg?itok=4XrQe9xQ","title":"Keep Landsat data free, panel urges Department of the Interior","authors":"Paul Voosen","pub_date":"Jun. 12, 2019 , 2:30 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/keep-landsat-data-free-panel-urges-interior-department"},{"abstract":"A tenured professor of anesthesiology at Emory University in Atlanta says he is being targeted by school administrators because of a letter he and other faculty members sent its president urging her to defend foreign scientists on campus and the value of international collaborations., Shan Ping Yu says his department chair told him on 31 May that he must vacate his office by the end of June. Officials said nothing about finding him another office on campus, Yu says, adding that he was told at a follow-up meeting that “if I don’t move out, they will send people to do it.”, In an 11 June email after that second meeting, the dean of Emory’s medical school, Vikas Sukhatme, told Yu that “your lab space is being adjusted” but wrote that the decision “was in no way influenced by either the letter you signed or your own ethnicity or nationality.” The letter did not mention the plan to take away Yu’s office, which he shares with three students and a postdoc working in his lab., Yu says he suggested two alternative office arrangements, including the use of recently vacated space, but was told that university officials had specifically identified needing his office at the medical school. When he persisted, Yu says, the chairman told him “you can move to the [Department of Veterans Affairs] medical center” 4 kilometers away., Yu, who has held an endowed chair since coming to Emory in 2008, says he doesn’t understand “how a tenured faculty member can be treated in this way.” Yu says it would be impossible for him to continue his research and mentoring responsibilities without an office on campus. “I think they want me to leave,” he says, “and this is the first step.”, On 17 March, Yu and eight other faculty members sent a letter to Emory President Claire Sterk asking her to “follow the example” of the presidents of Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley in voicing support for “protecting its international faculty and students from any and all kinds of mistreatment and discrimination.” (The letter came after several federal funding agencies, including the National Institutes of Health [NIH], announced actions to prevent foreign governments, particularly China, from improperly acquiring intellectual property developed by U.S.-funded research.) Sterk has not issued such a statement, although she spoke publicly in late February about the need “to promote, celebrate, and honor the voice of each and every member of our community” after the United Methodist Church, which has historic ties to the university, voted to limit the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning church members., Last month, Emory dismissed two of the signers of the March letter, Li Xiao-Jiang and Li Shihua, after university officials said they had failed to disclose funding and other ties to Chinese institutions in violation of federal policies. A third co-signer has also since left the university. All are Asian, and some have been Emory faculty members for decades., Yu says Emory officials told him a new junior faculty member in the department needed his office space and suggested Yu’s research productivity was waning. Yu disputes that characterization, noting that he was an investigator on $1.5 million in NIH funding in 2018. Although the two remaining active grants supporting his work are expiring at the end of 2019 and 2020, he says he has submitted proposals to NIH covering fresh lines of research aimed at helping victims of stroke and traumatic brain injury. “I have been supported by NIH for many years, and this sort of transition period is common,” he says., Asked about the demands on Yu, Vincent Dollard, an Emory spokesperson, said in a statement that “Emory and the School of Medicine appreciate Dr. Yu’s contributions.”, He added, “The adjustments to his laboratory space are pursuant to standard [School of Medicine] policies,” in which lab space is assigned based on a formula linked to outside funding. “The medical school is actively working on different options for Dr. Yu’s office and lab space,” Dollard said.","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/emory_16x9_1.jpg?itok=y-t40NC-","title":"Emory scientist was told to vacate his office.

But the progress was hard-won for scientists on NASA's $157 million Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), who discussed early results at a meeting last week, just as another Atlantic hurricane season kicked off., With its flotilla of satellites crisscrossing the tropical oceans, CYGNSS can see through the thick clouds of cyclones. The satellites collect radio signals beamed from standard GPS beacons after they bounce off the ocean's surface. The reflections are influenced by sea's roughness, which depends on wind speed. But a month after launch in December 2016, the team noticed the GPS signals were wavering. \"We assumed they are constant,\" says Christopher Ruf, CYGNSS's principal investigator and an atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \"And they're not.\", The U.S. military runs the GPS system, and in January 2017, it began to boost the radio power on 10 of its GPS satellites as they passed over a broad region centered on northern Syria. The power boosts, which can thwart jamming, have recurred without warning, each lasting several hours. \"It's an opaque situation, obviously, because it's a classified military situation,\" Ruf says. The swings don't interfere with other scientific uses of GPS. But they threw off the constellation's measurements of high winds by 5 meters a second or more—the difference between a category-2 and category-3 hurricane., After 2 years of work, the CYGNSS team has compensated by reprogramming its satellites on the fly. The satellites carry large antennas to catch reflected GPS signals, but they also have small antennas that receive direct GPS signals, for tracking time and location. The team repurposed the small antennas to measure the signal strength of the GPS satellites, making it possible to correct the wind speed measures. \"It works,\" Ruf says. \"We've been testing it for a number of months.\", Even before that fix, the wind data were good enough to improve some hurricane forecasts, says Bachir Annane, an atmospheric scientist at AOML. In the case of Michael, NOAA's forecast models failed, Annane says: They predicted it would track too far west, close to Alabama rather than Florida, and underestimated its ferocious winds. When he reran the models with CYGNSS winds, Annane found that the storm's forecasted early track and its intensity stayed closer to reality. The wind data would have improved track forecasts for two other recent hurricanes, Harvey and Irma, as well, he says., The satellites are also giving scientists a view of the winds underlying the Madden-Julian oscillation, a large cluster of storms that periodically forms in the Indian Ocean and marches around the equator, influencing global weather. \"Seeing under the rain was a big draw for us,\" says Eric Maloney, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins, because scientists have long debated what fuels the storms. Last week at the CYGNSS meeting, Bohar Singh, an atmospheric scientist who works with Maloney at CSU, described evidence from CYGNSS that persistent winds boost ocean evaporation under a 3000-kilometer-wide set of rainstorms, sustaining them. That finding could help scientists forecast how the storm belt will change in a warmer climate, Maloney says., After a few tweaks, CYGNSS can now look at land, too. Its antennas are capturing signs of soil moisture, says Clara Chew, a remote sensing hydrologist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Although not as capable as a single dedicated satellite, CYGNSS's multiple satellites make more frequent measurements, which could help it monitor flood risks and track how different soils retain rain. \"You can start to quantify how long the soil remembers,\" Chew says., NOAA scientists hope the new GPS fix will unleash the microsatellites' full potential for looking into storms, perhaps revealing new insights into why some hurricanes suddenly intensify. NOAA isn't likely to start using the CYGNSS data in its routine forecasts, Marks says. The satellites don't belong to the weather agency, and they are unlikely to last more than 7 years before failing. But he thinks their success against the odds could help persuade NOAA to launch its own wind-monitoring constellation.","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ca_0614NID_Hurricane_Michael_online.jpg?itok=_vNtCxcV","title":"NASA overcomes military’s GPS tweaks to peer inside hurricanes","authors":"Paul Voosen","pub_date":"Jun. 12, 2019 , 1:00 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/nasa-overcomes-militarys-gps-tweaks-peer-inside-hurricanes"},{"abstract":"Today, more than 150 million people regularly smoke cannabis, making it one of the world's most popular recreational drugs. But when and where humans began to appreciate the psychoactive properties of weed has been more a matter of speculation than science. Now, a team led by archaeologists Yang Yimin and Ren Meng of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing reports clear physical evidence that mourners burned cannabis for its intoxicating fumes on a remote mountain plateau in Central Asia some 2500 years ago., The study, published today in Science Advances, relies on new techniques that enable researchers to identify the chemical signature of the plant and even evaluate its potency. \"We are in the midst of a really exciting period,\" says team member Nicole Boivin of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History (MPI-SHH) in Jena, Germany. The paper is part of a wider effort to track how the drug spread along the nascent Silk Road, on its way to becoming the global intoxicant it is today., Cannabis, also known as hemp or marijuana, evolved about 28 million years ago on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, according to a pollen study published in May. A close relative of the common hop found in beer, the plant still grows wild across Central Asia. More than 4000 years ago, Chinese farmers began to grow it for oil and for fiber to make rope, clothing, and paper., Pinpointing when people began to take advantage of hemp's psychoactive properties has proved tricky. Archaeologists had made claims of ritual cannabis burning in Central Asian sites as far back as 5000 years ago. But new analyses of those plant remains by other teams suggest that early cannabis strains had low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant's most powerful psychoactive component, and so lacked mind-altering properties. One academic who works in Central Asia said he and colleagues tried to smoke and eat wild varieties—but got no buzz., The cannabis burned 2500 years ago at the Jirzankal cemetery, 3000 meters high in the Pamir Mountains in far western China, was different. Excavations there have uncovered skeletons and wooden plates, bowls, and Chinese harps, as well as wooden braziers that held burning material. All are typical of the Sogdians, a people of western China and Tajikistan who generally followed the Persian faith of Zoroastrianism, which later celebrated the mind-expanding properties of cannabis in sacred texts. At Jirzankal, glass beads typical of Western Asia and silk from China confirm the long-distance trade for which the Sogdians became famous, and isotopic analysis of 34 skeletons showed that nearly a third were migrants. Radiocarbon analysis put the burials at about 500 B.C.E., The wooden braziers were concentrated in the more elite tombs. Yang's and Ren's team ground bits of brazier into powder and applied gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify chemical compounds left behind. They found unusually high levels of THC compared with typical wild cannabis, although much less than in today's highly bred plants. The cannabis was apparently burned in an enclosed space, so mourners almost certainly inhaled THC-laced fumes, the authors say, making this the earliest solid evidence of cannabis use for psychoactive purposes., The region's high altitude could have stressed the cannabis, creating plants naturally high in THC, says co-author Robert Spengler, also of MPI-SHH. \"It is quite likely that people came across cannabis plants at higher elevations that were naturally producing higher THC levels,\" he says. But humans may also have intervened to breed a more wicked weed, he adds., \"The methods are convincing, and the data are unambiguous regarding early use of cannabis as a psychoactive substance,\" says Tengwen Long, an environmental scientist at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom who has researched cannabis origins. But Megan Cifarelli, an art historian at Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York, who has studied ancient drug use, notes the aromatic fumes might also have had another purpose: to mask the smell of a putrefying corpse., Yang's and Ren's team thinks cannabis use was restricted to elites until potent pot began to spread across Central Asia through the Silk Road linking China with Iran. In 440 B.C.E., the Greek historian Herodotus wrote that the nomadic Scythians, who controlled vast areas from Siberia to Eastern Europe, made tents and heated rocks in order to inhale hemp vapors that made them \"shout for joy.\" And Andrei Belinski, an archaeologist based at the heritage museum in Stavropol, Russia, in 2013 began to excavate a nearby 2400-year-old Scythian tomb that held gold vessels bearing residues of both opium and cannabis, supporting the idea that elites used the drug first., Ancient artwork and textual references from Syria to China hint at even earlier cannabis drug use, and the new analytical methods could soon provide concrete evidence of this, says Michael Frachetti, an archaeologist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. But it's already clear that the ancient Silk Road trafficked in more than spices, grains, and ideas. \"Crops weren't just about food,\" he says. \"They were also about making contact with another world.\"","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ca_0614NID_Cannabis_Brazier_online.jpg?itok=hXaLAPj4","title":"Oldest evidence of marijuana use discovered in 2500-year-old cemetery in peaks of western China","authors":"Andrew Lawler","pub_date":"Jun. 12, 2019 , 2:00 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/oldest-evidence-marijuana-use-discovered-2500-year-old-cemetery-peaks-western-china"},{"abstract":"On any given day, hospitals across the United States burn through some 16,500 liters (35,000 pints) of donated blood for emergency surgeries, scheduled operations, and routine transfusions. But recipients can’t take just any blood: For a transfusion to be successful, the patient and donor blood types must be compatible. Now, researchers analyzing bacteria in the human gut have discovered that microbes there produce two enzymes that can convert the common type A into a more universally accepted type. If the process pans out, blood specialists suggest it could revolutionize blood donation and transfusion., “This is a first, and if these data can be replicated, it is certainly a major advance,” says Harvey Klein, a blood transfusion expert at the National Institutes of Health’s Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, who was not involved with the work., People typically have one of four blood types—A, B, AB, or O—defined by unusual sugar molecules on the surfaces of their red blood cells. If a person with type A receives type B blood, or vice versa, these molecules, called blood antigens, can cause the immune system to mount a deadly attack on the red blood cells. But type O cells lack these antigens, making it possible to transfuse that blood type into anyone. That makes this “universal” blood especially important in emergency rooms, where nurses and doctors may not have time to determine an accident victim’s blood type., “Around the United States and the rest of the world, there is a constant shortage,” says Mohandas Narla, a red blood cell physiologist at the New York Blood Center in New York City., To up the supply of universal blood, scientists have tried transforming the second most common blood, type A, by removing its “A-defining” antigens. But they’ve met with limited success, as the known enzymes that can strip the red blood cell of the offending sugars aren’t efficient enough to do the job economically., After 4 years of trying to improve on those enzymes, a team led by Stephen Withers, a chemical biologist at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada, decided to look for a better one among human gut bacteria. Some of these microbes latch onto the gut wall, where they “eat” the sugar-protein combos called mucins that line it. Mucins’ sugars are similar to the type-defining ones on red blood cells., So UBC postdoc Peter Rahfeld collected a human stool sample and isolated its DNA, which in theory would include genes that encode the bacterial enzymes that digest mucins. Chopping this DNA up and loading different pieces into copies of the commonly used lab bacterium Escherichia coli, the researchers monitored whether any of the microbes subsequently produced proteins with the ability to remove A-defining sugars., At first, they didn’t see anything promising. But when they tested two of the resulting enzymes at once—adding them to substances that would glow if the sugars were removed—the sugars came right off. The enzymes also worked their magic in human blood. The enzymes originally come from a gut bacterium called Flavonifractor plautii, Rahfeld, Withers, and their colleagues report today in Nature Microbiology. Tiny amounts added to a unit of type A blood could get rid of the offending sugars, they found. “The findings are very promising in terms of their practical utility,” Narla says. In the United States, type A blood makes up just under one-third of the supply, meaning the availability of “universal” donor blood could almost double., But Narla says more work is needed to ensure that all the offending A antigens have been removed, a problem in previous efforts. And Withers says researchers need to make sure the microbial enzymes have not inadvertently altered anything else on the red blood cell that could produce problems. For now, the researchers are focusing on only converting type A, as it’s more common than type B blood. Having the ability to transform type A to type O, Withers says, “would broaden our supply of blood and ease these shortages.”","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/blood_16x9_0.jpg?itok=fQewIF2m","title":"Type A blood converted to universal donor blood with help from bacterial enzymes","authors":"Elizabeth Pennisi","pub_date":"Jun. 10, 2019 , 11:00 AM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/type-blood-converted-universal-donor-blood-help-bacterial-enzymes"},{"abstract":"The Ebola virus that has stubbornly lingered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since August 2018 has finally jumped the border, sickening a 5-year-old boy in Uganda. The Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe confirmed the infection, which the World Health Organization (WHO) announced this afternoon., WHO has long feared that the lingering Ebola outbreak in the DRC, which has sickened more than 2000 people there and killed about two-thirds of the identified cases, would spread to neighboring countries. Health care workers have widely deployed an effective Ebola vaccine in the affected DRC areas and intensively worked to contain cases, but their response has repeatedly been hampered by violence from the many insurgency groups, including attacks on health care workers and facilities., The boy and his family came to Uganda from the DRC and went to Uganda’s Kagando Hospital for care. He was then transferred to an Ebola treatment unit—where the health care workers already have been vaccinated—in nearby Bwera., The case will likely trigger anew a discussion of whether WHO should declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) about the outbreak, the second largest one ever to occur since the disease first was recognized in 1976. An expert committee twice had decided not to declare a PHEIC, largely because the outbreak had not spread to another country. A PHEIC might allow WHO and its partners to mount a stronger attack against the disease with increased resources and larger international teams of responders helping stop the spread and treat the infected.","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/si-ebolauganda.jpg?itok=q5ktmeyO","title":"Ebola makes much-feared jump into Uganda","authors":"Jon Cohen","pub_date":"Jun. 11, 2019 , 4:50 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/ebola-makes-much-feared-jump-uganda"},{"abstract":"Megan Sykes, an immunologist at Columbia University, has spent years using human fetal tissue to develop a mouse with a humanlike immune system, which mimics how type 1 diabetes develops in humans. The tissue is donated after elective abortions, and the mice are testbeds for potential diabetes treatments. But last week, she learned that President Donald Trump, acting on a priority of advocacy groups opposed to abortion, had issued a new policy that is likely to cause lengthy delays the next time she seeks U.S. government grants for her work—and could even choke off federal funding for all studies that use fetal tissue. The policy “is incredibly disappointing,” Sykes says, because it is a “politically motivated decree” that could derail numerous disease research efforts., The new Trump policy, issued 5 June after a 9-month review led by officials at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has three major components. One kills a long-standing contract between the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, and the University of California (UC), San Francisco, under which the university used fetal tissue to develop humanized mice for HIV drug testing. Another ends research using fetal tissue conducted by any scientist directly employed by NIH. The third and widest-reaching provision adds a lengthy and uncertain step to NIH’s process for awarding new or renewal grants to university scientists, such as Sykes, for studies that use human fetal tissue. It requires HHS to appoint a separate 14- to 20-member ethics advisory board to review each proposal that NIH reviewers have found worthy of funding. The review of up to 6 months will result in a funding recommendation to the HHS secretary, who can accept or reject the advice., Enacting the new policy “was the president’s decision …. to protect the dignity of human life,” Judd Deere, deputy White House press secretary, told Science. It was applauded by antiabortion activists, whose lobbying prompted HHS to launch its review of U.S.-funded fetal tissue research in September 2018. “This is a major pro-life victory,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List in Washington, D.C., Many biomedical researchers were stunned, noting that the tissue, which would otherwise be discarded, has properties that make it valuable for research. It is less specialized than adult tissue, for instance, and readily adapts to new environments. “These new restrictions have no scientific or ethical basis and will roll back decades of consensus in the U.S., delaying the development of new treatments,” said Doug Melton, president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research in Skokie, Illinois, and co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute., “The whole point here is to so wrap the research in red tape that it’s impossible or at least unlikely to be feasible for many researchers,” says bioethicist Alta Charo of the University of Wisconsin in Madison., A 1993 law formalized rules for using fetal tissue donated after elective abortions in U.S.-funded research. Last year, NIH spent $115 million on roughly 173 projects that rely on the tissue; about 160 were run by university scientists. One-third of the 173 grants focus on HIV/AIDS, many using humanized mice to probe, for example, how HIV hides out and evades the immune system, and what drugs might defeat it. Others tackle other infectious diseases, eye disease, and fetal development as well as toxic exposures during pregnancy., NIH says its scientists are conducting just three projects affected by the new rules; all will stop. “This decision is devastating. It effectively ends our studies looking into new approaches for an HIV cure,” says Warner Greene, director of the Gladstone Institutes Center for HIV Cure Research in San Francisco. Greene is a partner in one of the projects, run by retrovirologist Kim Hasenkrug of NIH’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana., At universities, the policy allows existing projects to continue until their current NIH funding expires. Nearly half of these extramural grants will expire within the next 18 months, and scientists will need to apply for a renewal if they want to keep the work going. Grantees are now grappling with what the new review process might mean., It has already caused at least one researcher to change course. HIV scientist Jerome Zack last week told colleagues at UC Los Angeles (UCLA) that he had decided to remove his work using fetal tissue to develop humanized mice from a renewal application, due at NIH in August, for a large grant supporting the university’s long-standing Center for AIDS Research. “The grant covers way more than mouse work, it covers all HIV research on campus,” he says. “I don’t want to jeopardize that.”, Scott Kitchen, a Zack collaborator who directs mouse production at UCLA, says that in the past year his group provided humanized mice for more than 70 scientists on campus and nine at other institutions, as well as performing multiple large projects for several companies. “All of this has been critical in scientific and therapeutic development,” Kitchen says. “And all of it may now be derailed.”, At Columbia, Sykes is worried about the one-third of her 15 staff who are funded through two NIH grants. She recently submitted a renewal proposal for one grant and planned to submit the other in July. HHS hasn’t said when the policy will kick in. But when Sykes asked NIH officials how it might affect her proposals, the response “wasn’t reassuring,” she says., Much could depend on whom the HHS secretary appoints to the ethics review boards. Under existing law governing HHS ethics boards, one-third to one-half of a board’s members must be scientists, and each must include at least one theologian, one ethicist, one physician, and one attorney. The law “absolutely” would allow HHS to pack the boards with members who oppose abortion, Charo says., Critics of the new policy also say it will undermine a goal of opponents of fetal tissue research: to find and encourage the use of alternatives. In December 2018, NIH Director Francis Collins noted that his agency was putting up to $20 million over 2 years into research on such alternatives. But scientists say that those alternatives need to be tested for validity against human fetal tissue itself. For the time being, Collins said in December 2018, fetal tissue would “continue to be the mainstay” for certain kinds of research., The new rules could remove that mainstay. But Charo notes a new president could reverse the policy, which is not codified in law.","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ca_0614NID_Megan_Sykes_online.jpg?itok=TEJJZQSw","title":"In wake of Trump’s fetal tissue clampdown, scientists strain to adjust","authors":"Meredith Wadman, Jocelyn Kaiser","pub_date":"Jun. 11, 2019 , 3:00 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/wake-trumps-fetal-tissue-clampdown-scientists-strain-adjust"},{"abstract":"When scientists talk about recent extinctions, birds and mammals get most of the attention. But the first global analysis of its kind finds that twice as many plants have disappeared than birds, mammals, and amphibians combined., Researchers reviewed published research, international databases, and museum specimens such as grasses from Madagascar (pictured), tallying up 571 plants species that have gone extinct in the past 250 years. One reason the total exceeds that of well-studied animals is that there are simply more kinds of plants. Looking at percentages, the situation is worse for mammals and birds; an estimated 5% of those species have gone extinct, compared with 0.2% of plants., The losses include the Chile sandalwood tree in the South Pacific, exploited for its fragrant timber. It was last seen on Robinson Crusoe Island in 1908. (The extinction rates among plants have been highest for trees and shrubs on islands—which often have species that occur nowhere else—and in regions with rich diversity, especially the tropics and in Mediterranean climates.), Just a few years later, the world lost the banded trinity (Thismia americana), a leafless plant that grew entirely underground except for its flowers. Most species of this kind of plant grow in rainforests, but T. americana was first described in 1912 in a sandy wetland in Chicago, Illinois, and was wiped out by development., The total of 571 extinct plant species is four times higher than the official listing kept by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in Gland, Switzerland, the team reports today in Nature Ecology & Evolution. Even so, it is probably still an underestimate, as less is known about the status of plants in Africa and South America than on other continents. Many of these species may vanish, too; a major review of the status of global biodiversity recently estimated than more than a million species (including 14% of plant and animal diversity) are threatened with extinction.","origin":" ScienceShots","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/plants_16x9.jpg?itok=93MkqVpy","title":"Twice as many plants have gone extinct than birds, mammals, and amphibians combined","authors":"Erik Stokstad","pub_date":"Jun. 10, 2019 , 11:00 AM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/twice-many-plants-have-gone-extinct-birds-mammals-and-amphibians-combined"},{"abstract":"Russia’s beleaguered space science program is hoping for a rare triumph this month. Spektr-RG, an x-ray satellite to be launched on 21 June from Kazakhstan, aims to map all of the estimated 100,000 galaxy clusters that can be seen across the universe. Containing as many as 1000 galaxies and the mass of 1 million billion suns, the clusters are the largest structures bound by gravity in the universe. Surveying them should shed light on the evolution of the universe and the nature of the dark energy that is accelerating its expansion., First proposed more than 30 years ago as part of a Soviet plan for a series of ambitious “great observatories” along the lines of NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, Spektr-RG fell victim to cost cutting in cash-strapped, post-Soviet Russia. But roughly €500 million satellite, which will carry German and Russian x-ray telescopes, was reborn early last decade with a new mission: not just to scan the sky for interesting x-ray sources, such as supermassive black holes gorging on infalling material, but to map enough galaxy clusters to find out what makes the universe tick. The new goal meant further delays. “There have been many ups and downs,” says Peter Predehl, leader of the team at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Garching, Germany, that built one of the satellite’s two telescopes. “Whenever we thought we were out of the woods, a new one came along.”, Spektr-RG was born in the late 1980s. Glasnost was encouraging Soviet researchers to collaborate with Western colleagues, and studies of SN 1987A, the nearest supernova in modern times, had demonstrated the power of x-rays for tracing such violent events. Rashid Sunyaev of Moscow’s Space Research Institute (IKI) proposed an x-ray observatory to orbit above Earth’s atmosphere, which blocks x-rays. The 6-ton mission soon bristled with five telescopes and involved 20 institutes in 12 countries including the United States. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Roscosmos struggled to keep its Mir space station aloft and contribute to the growing International Space Station (ISS). “They told us the spacecraft was too large for Russia, too ambitious,” says Sunyaev, now at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching. “It just died.”, Resurrection began in 2003 with plans for a smaller mission with a U.K.-built all-sky x-ray monitor and MPE’s x-ray survey telescope, called ROSITA—which had been destined for the ISS but was grounded by the Challenger space shuttle disaster. The new impetus was cosmology. Studies of distant supernovae in the 1990s had revealed that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Researchers wanted to know more about dark energy, the mysterious force that was causing it, and whether it varied in space or over time. Galaxy clusters are among the best indicators, says x-ray astronomer Andrew Fabian of the Institute of Astronomy (IoA) in Cambridge, U.K. “Clusters are the most massive objects in the universe, the pinnacle of galaxy formation, and are very sensitive to cosmological models.”, They are best seen in x-rays because the gaps between galaxies are filled with gas that is heated to millions of degrees as the galaxies jostle together to form a cluster. By mapping the clusters, says Esra Bulbul of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who recently joined the MPE team, Spektr-RG “will study the evolution of the structure of the universe.”, The challenge was to boost the capabilities of the existing ROSITA telescope, which could only garner up to 10,000 galaxy clusters. Discussions led to a €90 million “extended” eROSITA, paid for by MPE and the German Aerospace Center, DLR. It is an array of seven identical telescopes with five times the effective collecting area of the original instrument. Russia and Germany signed an agreement in 2007 with launch penciled in for 2012., But mission development was not smooth. The U.K. instrument failed to win funding and was replaced with a Russian telescope, called ART-XC, which will complement eROSITA by detecting scarcer high energy x-rays. Though harder to collect, the higher energy photons are particularly useful for seeing the supermassive black holes at galactic centers, because they pierce the clouds of gas and dust that shroud them., Making the mirrors for eROSITA also proved much harder than expected. Because x-rays would penetrate a traditional flat telescope mirror, focusing them requires cylindrical mirrors that gather x-ray photons in glancing, low-angle reflections off inner surfaces. Each of eROSITA’s seven scopes contains 54 gold-plated cylindrical mirrors, nested inside one another, that must be shaped precisely to bring the photons to a focus. Making them proved so difficult that the MPE team had to fire its main contractor part way through. “It almost killed us,” Predehl says., A decision to site the telescope at a quiet, gravitationally balanced point beyond the moon, outside the shelter of Earth’s magnetic field, meant electronics had to be hardened against solar radiation. Incompatibility between the German and Russian electronics delayed the launch, as did problems with the spacecraft’s communications system and a change in launch rocket., Now that Spektr-RG is finally ready, expectations are high. “It’s going to be revolutionary in terms of numbers,” says IoA astronomer George Lansbury, taking x-ray studies into “the big data regime.”, It may also be a rare high point for Russia’s great observatories program. Previously, only one has made it into orbit: 2011’s Spektr-R, a radio astronomy mission that fell short of expectations and could not be revived after malfunctioning earlier this year., Astronomers may face a long wait for Spektr-RG’s successors: the ultraviolet telescope Spektr-UV and Spektr-M, a millimeter-wave radio telescope. Spektr-UV has survived moments of near-death, most recently in 2014 when Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula caused major Ukrainian partners to withdraw. The mission is now slated for a 2025 launch, but, Sunyaev says, some collaborators, including a German team supplying a spectrograph, have dropped out. Spektr-M, which would come next, is not yet fully funded, he says. And in the meantime, rival telescopes launched by other countries may scoop up the science the Russian missions aim to do., “Russia is doing as much as possible with the budget available,” says Spektr-RG chief Mikhail Pavlinsky of IKI. He notes that Roscosmos’s lean budget, worth $20.5 billion over 10 years, faces multiple demands. Russia is building the landing system for the European ExoMars rover, due to launch next year, and like other countries it hopes to return to the moon with the Luna 25 lander in 2021. For Russia’s astrophysicists, Pavlinksy says, “It means slow progress.”","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ca_0614NID_Mirror_Platform_online.jpg?itok=hhSED_42","title":"Telescope designed to study mysterious dark energy keeps Russia’s space science hopes alive","authors":"Daniel Clery","pub_date":"Jun. 10, 2019 , 9:40 AM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/telescope-designed-study-mysterious-dark-energy-keeps-russia-s-space-science-hopes"},{"abstract":"Marking the culmination of a 33-year odyssey, scientists today report a milestone in type 1 diabetes: the first time the disease has been markedly delayed in young people at high risk. Presenting at the American Diabetes Association meeting in San Francisco, California, and publishing simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), researchers found that 2 weeks of an experimental intravenous (IV) drug held off disease by an average of about 2 years., The mainstay of type 1 diabetes treatment is insulin, discovered 97 years ago. These results open a new chapter, says Jeffrey Bluestone, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and part of the research team. “On the one hand,” the outcome is “pretty exciting,” Bluestone says. “On the other hand, now the real hard work begins.” That will mean considering how to move this treatment forward and probing whom it’s most likely to help., The clinical trial began 8 years ago and included 76 people, the youngest of whom were 8 years old and the oldest in their 40s. Nearly three-quarters were 18 and under. Each had an extremely high risk of type 1 diabetes. In this autoimmune disease, the body attacks cells in the pancreas that make insulin, which helps keep blood glucose levels in check. By the time diabetes is diagnosed, most of these insulin-producing cells, called beta cells, are gone., More than 1 million people in the United States have type 1 diabetes, which requires constant attention to blood sugar levels and insulin injections to stay alive. The condition carries a risk of long-term complications, including heart disease, blindness, and kidney failure. (People with the more common type 2 diabetes generally produce their own insulin, but their bodies can’t use it properly.), Over time, scientists have learned that type 1 diabetes begins years before it’s diagnosed. Subtle attacks on the pancreas are led by the sentries of the immune system, T cells. Those attacks are detectable by antibody markers in the blood. During this quiet battle, beta cells in the pancreas are still largely intact, offering a crucial window in which to intervene and save them., When researchers began to predict diabetes risk in people whose relatives had the disease, prevention was the obvious next step. But a raft of prevention trials in the United States and Europe—testing everything from oral insulin to high doses of a form of vitamin B—proved disheartening: Although there were traces of hope in certain subgroups of people, no studies were broadly successful. “This has been a completely disappointing area,” says Kevan Herold, an endocrinologist at Yale University who led the new clinical trial., It was a blossoming friendship decades ago between Herold and Bluestone, when both were newly minted researchers at the University of Chicago in Illinois, that carved the path to scientific success. Bluestone had designed an antibody drug in his lab that shut down activated T cells. It did this by targeting a molecule on the cells’ surface called CD3. By blunting activated T cells, this anti-CD3 antibody could stem autoimmune attacks, Bluestone thought., When he began the work, Bluestone imagined the therapy treating people who had received kidney transplants, because the body’s T cells often attack a new organ. But effective drugs for transplant patients had recently hit the market, and pharmaceutical companies weren’t interested. “It got dropped,” Bluestone says., Herold threw another idea Bluestone’s way. What if anti-CD3 could counter T cell attacks on the pancreas, which lead to type 1 diabetes? On something of a lark, in the early 1990s the pair injected anti-CD3 into a mouse model of diabetes, before the animals had become sick. The treatment kept many of them from developing diabetes., Another seminal moment came in 1994, when French immunologists Lucienne Chatenoud and Jean-François Bach at Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades in Paris reported that anti-CD3 reversed diabetes in newly diagnosed mice. The pair also honed the timing of the drug: It seemed to work best in animals whose T cells were revved up and staging pancreas attacks, and which were on the cusp of or had just developed diabetes. “If you don’t have much [T cell] activation yet, there’s nothing to block” says Jay Skyler, an endocrinologist at the University of Miami in Florida and part of the trial team reporting today. “If you go too late, that’s too overwhelming” for the drug to succeed., In 2000, Herold shifted from mice to people--but prevention research with anti-CD3 came with ethical concerns. Efforts to predict who would develop diabetes were nascent, and the idea of giving a potentially risky experimental drug to people who might never get sick was concerning. Furthermore, diabetes is a disease of childhood—half the patients are diagnosed before they’re 12 years old—compounding the ethical quandaries of prevention trials., So Herold instead focused on people who’d been recently diagnosed. His hope was that anti-CD3 could help preserve what few beta cells they had left, which would be destroyed as their disease progressed. This preservation, he reasoned, could mean injecting less insulin and better controlling glucose levels. His team reported in 2002 in NEJM that more than a year after treatment, nine of 12 treated patients had maintained or boosted their insulin production. Other trials of anti-CD3 moved ahead in new-onset patients and were largely successful., And then, in 2010, the program skidded to a halt: Two drug companies reported that two different anti-CD3 antibodies, one of them the antibody Bluestone had helped design, had failed to meet their goals in large trials of newly diagnosed people. “That was devastating,” Bluestone says. “Everyone kind of said, ‘OK, this doesn’t work.’”, Still, Herold, Bluestone, Skyler, and some others remained hopeful in the face of skepticism. They maintained that, among other things, the drug company trials relied on doses that were too low and included participants who didn’t have the autoimmune form of diabetes., Herold convinced a diabetes clinical trials network called TrialNet to support a prevention study of anti-CD3. TrialNet was then chaired by Skyler and is now led by Carla Greenbaum, an endocrinologist at the Benaroya Research Institute in Seattle, Washington. It opened to volunteers in 2011 and tested Bluestone’s version, by then named teplizumab. The trial team focused on recruiting people who resembled the mice Chatenoud and Bach had found success with years earlier: those with a combination of unstable blood sugar and blood antibodies who were teetering on the cusp of diabetes. Based on this mix, researchers estimated that participants had a 75% chance of getting diabetes in the next 5 years. They were identified through a vast network of screening centers across North America, Europe, and Australia established years ago by TrialNet, which aims in part to trace the natural history of type 1 diabetes and includes many thousands of relatives of people with the disease., Forty-four volunteers received teplizumab, and 32 got a placebo. Treatment in both groups involved 14 consecutive days of IV infusion. Enrollment was slow. Screening was laborious, and, Herold theorizes, perhaps there was hesitation because other prevention trials had failed, and so had teplizumab in the large drug company study. The planned trial with 144 people was scaled back to 76—which meant teplizumab needed to shine in order to see a difference between the treatment and the placebo., Late last year, Herold procrastinated when it came time to analyze the data. “I kept pushing it off,” he says, because he worried about failure. Instead, the difference between the two groups was statistically stark. In the treatment group, the median time to a diabetes diagnosis was just over 4 years; in the placebo group, it was 2 years. Forty-three percent of those who got the experimental drug developed diabetes after 5 years, versus 72% of those receiving a placebo. Participants who got teplizumab and had certain gene variants seemed especially likely to avoid disease., “I thought it was going to be difficult” to show an effect with so few patients, says Chatenoud, who wasn’t involved in the trial. “This is why I think it’s so meaningful that it worked. … These data are the first to show it is possible to prevent the progression of type 1 diabetes.”, Though some researchers describe the study as a prevention trial, Herold hastens to point out that, strictly speaking, it was designed to test delay of disease onset, not prevention. Testing prevention could mean waiting for participants to die to confirm they stay diabetes free—something that’s obviously not feasible. Still, he and others wonder whether there’s a subset for whom true prevention is possible; it will take many years to find out., Doctors say even a 2-year delay in disease is important. “To gain 2 years of an insulin-free life … I think that’s significant,” says Mark Atkinson, a pathologist at the University of Florida’s Diabetes Institute in Gainesville, who has probed the origins of the disease and conducted clinical trials. “You have to think of mom or dad having 2 years less of getting up at night” to check their child’s blood sugar levels, he says, along with a potentially lower risk of long-term complications. Two weeks of teplizumab “is a small price to pay” for extra diabetes-free time he says., That’s especially true because safety fears raised about teplizumab in the early years haven’t panned out. Chatenoud says that, to date, more than 800 people have received the therapy, and “the side effects have not been what people feared.” In the trial, common side effects included a rash and a low white blood cell count; both resolved within weeks., The big question now is what’s next? Some say that running a larger prevention trial of teplizumab could be challenging, because giving young people a placebo might be hard to justify now. One major hurdle is that although Herold’s trial focused on those with a first-degree relative with diabetes, at least 85% of diabetes patients don’t have that family history—meaning that screening on a grand scale would be needed to reach everyone at risk. “Who’s going to pay for that? And will the public even participate?” Atkinson wonders., The next steps will partly be up to the company that now holds rights to teplizumab, Provention Bio in Oldwick, New Jersey; the experimental treatment has passed through many corporate hands over the years., No matter what happens next, Herold hopes his study will mark a turning point. He thinks of the trial’s first volunteer, who enrolled at Herold’s center at Yale. At the time, the teenager was in college; after graduating, he moved to New York City. As Herold was finalizing the trial data, he noticed that this participant, whom Herold would later learn had gotten teplizumab, had dropped off the radar., “I called him up and said, ‘What’s going on?’” Herold recalls. Not much, the young man admitted; he was feeling fine and had forgotten to follow up with the researchers. It was an answer that delighted Herold. “That’s great, that’s terrific,” he thought to himself. Forgetting is what someone with diabetes can’t allow themselves to do—so for this young man, who remains disease free, it meant everything.\n\nClarification, June 10, 2019, 12:00 pm: This story was updated to add the name of TrialNet's current chair.","origin":" News","image":"https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/insulin_16x9.jpg?itok=mK5VQYUw","title":"In milestone trial, experimental drug delays type 1 diabetes","authors":"Jennifer Couzin-Frankel","pub_date":"Jun. 9, 2019 , 1:00 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/milestone-trial-experimental-drug-delays-type-1-diabetes"},{"abstract":"Study of marathon runners reveals a ‘hard limit’ on human endurance, Athletes who can run the equivalent of 117 marathons in just months might seem unstoppable.

New research suggests the insects charge into spiderwebs to rescue their ensnared nestmates, sometimes ripping the silk apart to free them., Researchers first observed the fearless ants in 2015 in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts. Not only did the insects free their comrades from the sticky silk, they dismantled the entire web afterward, ripping it apart with their jaws for up to 2 hours, the team reports in The American Naturalist. The rescues weren’t without personal risk; about 6% of rescuers got stuck in the silk themselves or were captured by the spider lurking nearby., When the scientists brought the ants back to their lab, they discovered that the insects ignored empty webs. Their valor is likely spurred by chemical distress signals put out by their web-bound siblings, the team suspects., The findings put desert harvester ants in an exclusive club of animals that engage in “rescue behavior,” which is typically reserved for mammals like primates and dolphins. Even rarer are those that destroy traps, limited among vertebrates to two groups of chimpanzees and mountain gorillas that disassemble poachers’ snares., The researchers think the ants’ heroic streak may have evolved because V. pergandei has to collect enough seeds for the colony to produce hundreds of new ants daily. This makes every forager’s life—and their labor—indispensable.","origin":" ScienceShots","image":"//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/contributor_thumb_sq/public/contributor-images/jb_head_ed.jpg?itok=l7HqhMVx","title":"Watch an ant rip apart a spiderweb to rescue a sibling","authors":"Jake Buehler","pub_date":"Jun. 7, 2019 , 12:25 PM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/watch-ant-rip-apart-spiderweb-rescue-sibling"},{"abstract":"Like us, fish need oxygen to survive. But to breathe, most pull oxygen-containing water into their mouths and pump it through their gill chambers before expelling it out of their gill slits. Now, for the first time, scientists have seen fish “holding” that breath, some for up to 4 minutes at a time., The scientists didn’t set out to catch such persistent fish. Instead, they stumbled on videos of coffinfish, a rarely studied group that lives on ocean bottoms throughout the world, captured by remotely operated vehicles in a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expedition., The videos, shot in multiple locations in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, show eight deep-sea coffinfish holding large quantities of water in their gill chambers without any signs of inhaling or exhaling. When the coffinfish finally release the water minutes later, their bodies deflate by 20% to 30% (above). It’s their enormous gill chambers that let these fish store such large volumes of water for several minutes, the researchers report in the Journal of Fish Biology., Why do they do it? The researchers suggest that holding their breath for long stretches may help the notoriously lazy coffinfish conserve the energy they would otherwise use to actively pump water. Puffing up to such a massive size may also serve as a warning to would-be predators.","origin":" ScienceShots","image":"//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/plants_16x9.jpg?itok=FndE_WFp","title":"Spotted for the first time: a fish holding its breath underwater","authors":"Erica Tennenhouse","pub_date":"Jun. 7, 2019 , 8:00 AM","link":"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/spotted-first-time-fish-holding-its-breath-underwater"},{"abstract":"Cheap and easy to make, perovskite minerals have become the wonder material of solar energy. Now, scientists are turning from using perovskites to capture light to using them to emit it. Staff Writer Robert Service joins host Sarah Crespi to talk about using these minerals in all kinds of light-emitting diodes, from cellphones to flat screen TVs., Read the related paper in Science Advances., Also this week, Sarah talks with Caitlin Thurber, a biologist at Nassau Community College in Garden City, New York, about a hard limit on human endurance. Her group used data from transcontinental racers—who ran 957 kilometers over the course of 20 weeks—and found that after about 100 days, their metabolism settled in at about 2.5 times the baseline rate, suggesting a hard limit on human endurance at long timescales. Earlier studies based on the 23-day Tour de France found much higher levels of energy expenditure, in the four- to five-times-baseline range., This week’s episode was edited by Podigy., Ads on the show: KiwiCo.com, Listen to previous podcasts., About the Science Podcast, [Image: N.
