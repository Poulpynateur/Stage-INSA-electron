Saguy, Juliet A. Williams, Robin Dembroff and Daniel Wodak","pub_date":"May 30, 2019","abstract":"Two of us (Saguy and Williams) recently proposed that we should all use they/them pronouns. In a post in Scientific American, Hanna et al. disagreed with this proposal. This provides a helpful opportunity to clarify our idea, and to explain how it fits into broader debates about gendered language. To do so, we have collaborated on this response with Robin Dembroff and Daniel Wodak—philosophers who have independently been developing their own argument for why we should do away with gendered pronouns. Together, we seek to address some common misunderstandings about our proposal.\n\nOne thing Hanna et al. object to is our perceived failure to take “trans perspectives” into account. In fact, our work draws extensively on trans perspectives, including published work by trans authors and interviews with LGBTQ+ activists. The fact that we considered how the use of gendered pronouns may reinforce gender inequality does not mean our piece was not informed by trans perspectives.\n\nSuch an assumption risks reinforcing divisive rhetoric that on matters of gender justice, the needs of women and those of transgender and gender-nonconforming people are inevitably in conflict. We believe it is crucial to take into account multiple perspectives on gendered language and develop an intersectional approach; after all, research shows that women of color are disproportionately at risk of being misgendered.\n\nLeaving aside this methodological issue, Hanna et al.’s primary concern is that “a move toward gender-neutral pronouns ignores the important work that gendered pronouns perform in everyday life.” They contend that “avoiding the act of gendering manifests as another form of violence.”\n\nThis is a subtle issue; it needs to be handled with care. Most fundamentally, we disagree with the claim that “avoiding the act of gendering” is always a “form of violence.” It is wrong to misgender others. But it is not generally important to gender others correctly, as long as we do not gender others incorrectly. When a student refers to a university instructor as “Professor So-and-So,” this avoids misgendering by avoiding any act of gendering in the first place.\n\nThat said, selective avoidance of gendering can be wrongful. Consider an example from one of the interviews that informed this work. During an interview with a self-described gender-nonconforming person, we were told of a recent experience going through airport security. Every other passenger was addressed as “Thank you, sir” or “Thank you, ma’am.” When it came to this person, the TSA officer just said “Thank you,” which was experienced as stigmatizing because it was a glaring departure from a practice of showing respect via gendering.\n\nHanna et al.’s view is the equivalent of insisting that the TSA continue thanking “sirs” and “ma’ams”—that is, continue gendering passengers by default. Our view is the equivalent of insisting that the TSA should just say “thank you” to everyone and avoid gendering anyone. Hanna et. al. acknowledge the serious harms of misgendering but they offer no plausible solution to the pervasive problem of misgendering, especially for transgender and gender-nonconforming people and people of color.\n\nWe do. Our proposed solution is to use gender-neutral pronouns as the default, with the long-term goal of using they/them pronouns for everyone. That’s a far cry from advocating for the willful misgendering of a person who asks to be referred to using a specific pronoun or legitimizing the refusal to gender a trans person while gendering everyone else.\n\nHanna et al. further contend that our proposal is based on a “Western-centric view of language,” pointing out that there are languages like Bangla that don’t have gendered pronouns. True. There are also languages with less gendered grammar than Bangla and languages with more gendered grammar than English. This raises questions for Hanna et al. and anyone else who defends the status quo in English: if gendered pronouns are so valuable, should languages like Bangla introduce them? Are trans and gender-nonconforming persons wronged when they are not gendered (correctly or incorrectly) by the accepted pronouns in Bangla or Finnish or Malay or Kurdish? Presumably not.\n\nIt is worth reflecting on why this is so. One reason is connected to Hanna et al.’s observation that, without grammatical gender, people can still gender themselves. But crucially, without grammatical gender they have more autonomy over whether and when they are gendered: trans women can declare their gender when doing so is safe and significant, without risking misgendering by others’ use of gendered pronouns.\n\nAnother reason why avoiding gendering does no harm connects back to the discussion of equality. The preference for gendered pronouns among English-speaking trans and gender-nonconforming people is best understood as a preference for equality: just as our interviewee prefers to be treated like other passengers, a trans woman may understandably prefer to be called “she” in a world where cis women are called “she.” If cis women were all called “they”—as they are in the languages mentioned above—equality requires that trans women be called “they” too. This is particularly important in institutional contexts.\n\nAs Hanna, et al. point out (citing Dean Spade), institutions have long used gender categorization to marginalize trans and gender-nonconforming people. In light of this history, we think efforts to remove gendered language from legislation and institutional processes should be lauded. Certainly, they should not be opposed as a form of “administrative violence.”\n\nThe differences between grammatical gender systems in natural languages provide a fruitful basis for empirical research. This includes testing Hanna et al.’s hypothesis that a natural language without gendered pronouns “doesn’t have the effect of reducing gender inequality, nor does it reduce the cisnormative desire to categorize by gender.”\n\nIn fact, studies find that grammatical gender in natural languages does affect gender inequality and essentialism in gender categorization. Of course, there are confounding variables here: plenty of other social, cultural and political factors affect levels of gender equality. But a clear implication of this research is that gendered language affects gendered thought. That finding undermines Hanna et al.’s most important objection: “Getting rid of gendered pronouns as a means of addressing gender inequalities would be the equivalent of treating symptoms without treating the root of the illness.” On the contrary, evidence suggests that degendering English would reduce gender discrimination and gender essentialism. If this is right, it is an important tool of addressing gender injustices, root and branch.","title":"We Should All Use They/Them Pronouns ...

The author is one of those experts.\n\nThe plastic waste crisis has been growing and deepening for years. We’ve known it was happening, and too many of us have stood by and watched it escalate. Fortunately, we are starting to see the emergence of a broad and growing group of stakeholders who are coming together—in their own ways—to tackle this complex challenge. I became involved in this topic nearly 15 years ago through my environmental work at Coca-Cola. At that time, there was an emerging discussion about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which may now be more than twice the size of Texas. But beyond that fact, little was known.\n\nA few of us working in this area became concerned by the scale of the problem and started to ask for more science and data to help guide us to solutions. Fast-forward to 2012, when a National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) working group brought together, for the first time, leading academics to take a closer look at the existing science. The effort represented a turning point in understanding the problem and how we might go about devising solutions to tackle it. One of the papers the NCEAS group produced started to point at  the leaking countries—nations where the most plastic waste was flowing into our oceans—and brought into sharper focus where we could prioritize resources to begin to address the crisis.\n\nThe Ocean Conservancy followed with a groundbreaking report, Stemming the Tide, which indicated that focusing on waste management in these countries would be one of the most impactful levers to stop the flow of eight million metric tons of plastic entering the world’s oceans each year. The million-dollar question—or, in this case, the multibillion-dollar question—is where to find the resources to solve the problem. There are significant infrastructure needs in these countries, and currently, very little funding is flowing into the development of new waste and recycling solutions.\n\nOur mission at Circulate Capital is to catalyze billions of dollars to invest in such solutions by proving the case for financing for-profit enterprises that are developing in South and Southeast Asia (SSEA), the area currently responsible for 45 percent of the oceans’ plastic waste. By demonstrating the possibility to generate financial returns from these investments, we believe we can unlock the public and private institutional investors needed to address this challenge.\n\nAs we start to fund, and unlock other investments in, solutions to plastic pollution, it is important that we keep the science and data in mind to prioritize the dollars and their potential impact. That is why we are only looking to invest in companies with approaches that are scalable and replicable. In the Investment Handbook that we issued this past March, we identified disrupters at every level, from collection to aggregation and recycling, that need financial capital to scale solutions and laid out a variety of factors impacting the entire plastics value chain to help investors evaluate opportunities and deploy assets in the SSEA region.\n\nThe handbook is a first-of-its-kind guide to investment opportunities in SSEA’s municipal waste–management and recycling–infrastructure sectors, the two sectors in the region that Circulate Capital and the Ocean Conservancy identified as having the most solutions ready to scale. It lays out a variety of factors impacting the entire plastics value chain to help investors evaluate opportunities and deploy assets in SSEA.\n\nBut investing in companies such as these is not going to be enough. There are simply not enough options ready to scale. In addition to the financial capital required to help solve this problem, we also see a great need for human capital and innovation support The Incubator Network by Circulate Capital and SecondMuse, which we announced in September 2018, seeks to change that situation, The Incubator Network uses philanthropic and public funds and technical assistance to bolster and develop public and nonprofit entities to implement new approaches and build capacity that can support large institutional capital commitments.\n\nSolving the plastic-waste crisis will not be easy, and there is no silver bullet. The challenge demands the realignment of the ecosystem that generates ocean plastic pollution and the creation of one that remediates it—forming a circular economy that takes old plastic and turns it into a new, reusable resource for future materials. But we believe that the process we have begun will prove that investment in the resource-recovery sector can ultimately provide financial returns, completely change the system and start to solve the problem of ocean plastic.","title":"Science on the Hill: How to Make Recycling Profitable","origin":"Observations","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/88835330-1227-4FF9-A2FCA0CAD6CA3BA9_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&CA7D31FE-922D-4008-8E9A4EB0810DA9BA","link":"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/science-on-the-hill-how-to-make-recycling-profitable/"},{"authors":"Helen Shen","pub_date":"May 30, 2019","abstract":"As the world’s aging population grows rapidly, so has its appetite for health tips, tricks and products that could help guard against the ravages of time. Among countless dietary supplements—vitamins, minerals and other products—some people have pinned their hopes on a molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a key player in the cellular production of energy. Often written as NAD+, the name of its oxidized form, the molecule participates in a host of metabolic pathways and is involved in other important processes, such as DNA repair. NAD+ levels naturally decline as people and animals age, and this loss has been proposed as contributing to the underlying physiology of aging.\n\nStudies show that boosting NAD+ levels can extend life span in yeast, worms and mice. Animal research also indicates NAD+’s promise for improving several aspects of health. Raising levels of the molecule in old mice appears to rejuvenate mitochondria—the cell’s energy factories, which falter over time. Other mouse studies have demonstrated benefits such as improved cardiovascular function, enhanced muscle regeneration and better glucose metabolism with NAD+ supplementation.\n\nBanking on such results, multiple companies currently sell dietary supplements containing NAD+ precursors such as nicotinamide riboside (NR) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NR supplements, in particular, have attracted buzz for the scientific star power associated with two major suppliers, ChromaDex and Elysium Health. The companies’ research advisers hail from institutions such as Stanford, Harvard and Columbia University. Elysium’s scientific advisory board currently boasts eight Nobel laureates.\n\nBut the NR business and some scientists involved have attracted their share of criticism as well. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements are lightly regulated by U.S. authorities, allowing them to be sold before research confirms their safety and effectiveness in humans. Recent clinical trials funded by ChromaDex and Elysium show that adults taking NR-containing supplements for six to eight weeks experience increased levels of NAD+ in their blood without serious side effects. But researchers are still working to prove that NR can actually improve human health—a sticking point for critics and an issue acknowledged by the companies themselves.\n\n“Not everything that works in mice works in humans, which is why it’s critical to do the rigorous human trials,” says Leonard Guarente, a co-founder of Elysium and its chief scientist. The company is studying the effectiveness of its NR-containing supplement for a number of conditions in people, including kidney injury and fatty liver. Early this year, Elysium published a small trial showing that its product could potentially slow the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ChromaDex’s NR supplement is also the subject of many clinical trials, with the company recently sponsoring a study of its effects on cognitive function, mood and sleep in people older than 55.\n\nFor very different reasons, NAD+ has also attracted a wave of attention from cancer researchers. Recent studies suggest that cancer cells of many types depend on NAD+ to sustain their rapid growth and that cutting off the NAD+ supply could be an effective strategy for killing certain cancers. The data from these studies paint a more complicated picture of NAD+ and raise new questions about the diverse ways taking an NAD+-boosting supplement might influence health. “It might still slow down the aging part, but it might fuel the cancer part,” says Versha Banerji, a clinician-scientist at the University of Manitoba. “We just need to figure out more about the biology of both of those processes, to figure out how we can make people age well and also not get cancer.”\n\nIn a Nature Cell Biology study in February scientists reported a newly discovered role for NAD+ metabolism at the intersection of cellular aging and cancer—specifically, in a process called cellular senescence. Senescence occurs when aging, damaged cells stop dividing. The process can help suppress cancer, but it leads cells to produce inflammatory molecules that can also promote cancer growth under certain conditions. In the Nature Cell Biology study, Rugang Zhang of the Wistar Institute, and his colleagues found that in cells entering senescence, rising levels of NAMPT (a major NAD+-producing enzyme in mammals) encourage the release of inflammatory and potentially protumor molecules. Consistent with those findings, mice genetically predisposed toward pancreatic cancer developed more precancerous and cancerous growths when they consumed the NAD+ precursor NMN. Zhang says more research is needed to fully understand the role of NAD+ in cancer, but he adds that “we should be cautious and bear in mind the potential downside of NAD+ supplementation as a dietary approach for antiaging.”\n\nZhang’s work is part of a growing body of research that has drawn attention to NAD+ metabolism in cancer, particularly involving NAMPT. Compared with healthy tissues, elevated NAMPT levels have been reported in several human cancers including colorectal, ovarian, breast and prostate cancers. In studies in animals and cells, drugs that inhibit NAMPT have shown promise in killing cancer cells or enhancing the effectiveness of other cancer therapies.\n\nIn 2016 researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found that among people with glioblastoma—an aggressive form of brain cancer—tumors with higher NAMPT levels correlated with shorter survival times. When human glioblastoma cells were implanted in mice, the cells proliferated and established new tumors. But when researchers suppressed NAMPT in these cells before implantation, they later saw reduced brain-tumor formation and increased survival in the mice—suggesting that glioblastoma cells depend on NAMPT and NAD+ to thrive.\n\nWhat might this result say about NAD+-boosting supplements? “There’s a lot of buzz about taking NAD+ precursors for their anti-aging effects, which is based on a lot of great science,” said Albert Kim, senior author of the 2016 study, in a School of Medicine press release “I don’t know if taking NAD+ precursors makes existing tumors grow faster, but one implication of our work is that we don’t yet fully understand all of the consequences of enhancing NAD+ levels.”\n\nThese emerging questions are not ruffling makers of NR supplements. “I’m not losing sleep over this,” says Charles Brenner, chief scientific advisor for ChromaDex. Reports of higher-than-normal NAMPT levels in many cancers do not prove that high NAD+ levels actually promote cancer growth, he notes. He contends that studies that kill cancer cells by suppressing the NAD+-producing enzyme also do not properly address the issue. \"Whether low NAD+ would block cancer and whether high NAD+ would promote cancer are two separate questions,” he says.\n\nIndeed, Zhang’s study is one of the first to directly show that providing supplemental NAD+, via the precursor NMN, was associated with increased cancerous growths in mice. But Elysium’s Guarente is skeptical of the data, arguing that Zhang’s study showed a small effect in a small number of animals and that it has yet to be replicated by other groups. “I don’t think the evidence is there at all to say that raising NAD+ levels would favor cancer,” Guarente says.\n\nAt the moment, the idea that elevating NAD+ levels could fuel cancer growth remains a hypothesis, but it is one that has attracted considerable attention. Cancer cells have high metabolic needs, including processes requiring NAD+. And many types of cancer cells boost NAD+-making enzymes and then die when those enzymes are blocked by drugs. “We know that they like NAD+, but it’s too early to say, if you add NAD+, whether they will grow really fast,” says Shashi Gujar, a cancer immunologist at Dalhousie University. “Many labs are working to figure that out.”\n\nThe answer may not be a single or straightforward one. NAD+ is a ubiquitous and fundamental molecule, involved in many biological pathways and cellular operations. Its ingestion could lead to a mix of positive and negative outcomes, the balance of which might depend on context. NAD+ precursors, consumed orally, may be taken up by some tissues more than others. And different cell types are known to employ distinct metabolic programs, which could lead to tissue-specific responses to NAD+.\n\nLike the tissues from which they arise, cancers are diverse in their cellular ways—and at least some run counter to the “cancer fuel” hypothesis of NAD+. A 2014 study, for instance, reported that in a mouse model of liver cancer, inhibiting NAD+ production was a key step by which an errant gene caused DNA damage and tumor formation. In this case, feeding NR to the mice actually helped protect against these harmful effects.\n\nTogether these findings do not necessarily point to ready answers for consumers interested in NR or NMN supplements, so much as they highlight questions for scientists to address in the coming years. “I would say that given that many people are taking these supplements for health benefits, a study of what these do to cancer risk or existing cancer biology is warranted,” says Matthew Vander Heiden, a clinician-scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.\n\nThe need for more evidence is a sentiment that is shared by others. “There is tremendous interest in the NAD+ field right now,” Gujar says. “And I’m pretty sure sooner or later, we will have the evidence to answer this.”","title":"Cancer Research Points to Key Unknowns about Popular “Antiaging” Supplements","origin":"Medicine","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/15099623-E8AA-465F-81EBA8649E6ADFFC_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&38FDA6A9-0CCF-469B-A10D028487544964","link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cancer-research-points-to-key-unknowns-about-popular-antiaging-supplements/"},{"authors":"Diana Kwon","pub_date":"May 29, 2019","abstract":"Few things are more refreshing than enjoying a cool beverage after spending a day under the hot summer sun. But gulping down a drink does not always quench thirst. Seawater, for example, may look appealing to someone stranded in the middle of the ocean, but taking a swig of it will only worsen dehydration.\n\nScientists have now discovered that in rodents, signals from both the throat and gut control feelings of thirst. These distinct pathways may explain why consuming a beverage is typically refreshing but does not always sate one’s thirst, according to a study by Yuki Oka, a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology, and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology, published May 29 in Neuron.\n\nLast year, Oka’s team reported that the simple act of gulping activated a circuit in the lamina terminalis, a region near the front of the brain, which ultimately led to the suppression of activity in neurons responsible for generating feelings of thirst. This throat-brain pathway, which the researchers identified in mice, switched on regardless of what an animal consumed—water, saline solution and oil produced similar effects. But the fact that all of these substances were able to inhibit the brain’s “thirst” neurons indicated that there was something missing. After all, if any liquid could satisfy an animal’s thirst, it might not consume enough water to remain hydrated.\n\nAccording to Oka, behavioral studies in animals dating back decades suggested that there was an additional mechanism in the gut that signaled the presence of water to the brain. So in their latest investigation, Oka’s team set out to map the brain circuits responsible for receiving these signals. By injecting fluids directly into the guts of mice, the researchers discovered that in order for the rodents to feel fully hydrated, this second gut-based circuit needed to be activated. Without these gastrointestinal signals—which, unlike ones from the throat, selectively responded to the presence of water—the brain’s “thirst” neurons quickly revved up again, driving the animals to drink more.\n\nThe throat sends an immediate but temporary thirst-quenching signal to the brain once an animal starts gulping. At that point, the body is unaware of what it is consuming, and “you don’t want to make a mistake and keep drinking something that’s dehydrating,” Oka explains. The second signal from the gut then acts as a “checking mechanism” that makes sure to hold the brakes on thirst only if what the body consumed was actually water. \n\nIn another study, published earlier this year in Nature, Zachary Knight, an associate professor of physiology at the University of California, San Francisco, and his colleagues also reported that the gut sensed the water content of an ingested fluid and sent a signal that suppressed thirst in the brain. “[It] is rather cool that two separate groups reach the same conclusion at about the same time,” says Charles Bourque, a neuroscientist at McGill University, who was not involved in either investigation. \n\nOver the past few years, a handful of labs have identified two parallel stories explaining the neurobiology of thirst and hunger. While these processes are mediated by distinct populations of cells in the brain, “the logic is very similar in both systems,” Knight says. After drinking and eating, the brain receives a very fast signal from either the throat or mouth that it uses to estimate how much an animal has ingested or what it is going to ingest. Then, after a delay of a couple of minutes, it gets a slower signal from the gut that confirms what was consumed (in the case of hunger, calories, and in the case of thirst, water).\n\nOka’s team also wanted to know whether both the oral and gastrointestinal signals were rewarding—driving the underlying motivation to drink. To find out, the researchers measured the levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in generating feelings of pleasure, in the rodents’ brain. Doing so revealed that while the act of drinking both water and saline led to a release of dopamine, gut infusions of those liquids had no effect. In addition, water-deprived mice were willing to press a lever to receive a spurt of water into the mouth but not directly into the stomach. “If the animals like something, they would work for it,” says study co-author Vineet Augustine, a graduate student in Oka’s lab. This finding, he adds, “clearly shows that [water in the gut] is not rewarding even though it is satiating.” \n\nInterestingly, other groups have found that unlike water, nutrients in the gastrointestinal tract do stimulate the brain’s pleasure centers. Ivan De Araujo, a neuroscientist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, says that this result is not too surprising because work by his lab has shown that water in the gut does not influence behaviors in the same way nutrients do. One reason for this difference, according to De Araujo, may be that water concentrations need to be tightly controlled, while excess energy from food can be stored for later use. In addition, unlike water, there is a wide diversity of nutrients that an animal can consume—and work by De Araujo and others has shown that animals can develop, independent of taste, a set of flavor preferences that hinge on the caloric content in the gut.  \n\nBut these differences raise some interesting questions. For one, De Araujo wonders what happens when nutrients are consumed in liquid form. “If you are really thirsty, and you buy a can of Coke to quench your thirst, you are putting a lot of sugar in the gut at the same time,” he says. “[This] may somehow mix the two drives and form ambiguous rewards.”\n\nMore research is needed to confirm why nutrients in the gut are rewarding, while water is not. Another uncertainty is how, exactly, signals travel from the throat or gut to the brain. Knight’s group began to address this topic in its recent paper by demonstrating that the vagus nerve, a bundle of fibers connecting the brain stem to the major organs in the body, was involved in the process. But there are still open questions about what kind of information is being sent and whether other signals, such as hormones, also play a role.\n\nWhile most of these studies have been conducted in rodents, researchers think that similar circuits exist in humans. There is some evidence for this idea, such as neuroimaging work in people that have identified activity in the lamina terminalis in response to thirst. In addition, according to Knight, the brain areas under investigation are thought to be evolutionarily highly conserved because they are involved in basic behaviors needed for survival.  \n\nFurther probing these circuits could help scientists understand what happens when they go awry. For example, elderly people tend to feel less thirst, which can make them vulnerable to dehydration. On the other hand, some individuals experience polydipsia—a condition that causes excessive, unquenchable thirst. This research could also shed light on the mechanisms that underlie many of our behaviors. “Basic drives like hunger and thirst are the reason we do a lot of the things that we do,” Knight says. “So understanding how they’re regulated provides insight into the origin of our own motivations.”","title":"Does Thirst Start in the Mouth or the Gut?","origin":"Neuroscience","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/C508712C-52A5-4A19-B9B5D4D196033A8A_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&084F9D85-3CE5-4079-80E4B56807E63748","link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-thirst-start-in-the-mouth-or-the-gut/"},{"authors":"Elizabeth Howell, SPACE.com","pub_date":"May 29, 2019","abstract":"Scientists scouring old Kepler Space Telescope data have tracked down 18 more relatively small exoplanets imaged by the famed planet-hunting observatory.\n\nWhile most of the planets orbit close to their parent stars and have scorching surface temperatures of up to about 1,830 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 degrees Celsius), one world orbits a small red dwarf star in an area called the “habitable zone.” That term is usually defined as the area around a star where a rocky planet could host liquid water on its surface. However, life is never a slam-dunk, and on this world, it would be particularly tricky because red dwarfs put out killer X-rays that could make living on nearby planets a challenge, even for microbes.\n\nA new computer algorithm flushed out the hidden planets from data gathered by K2, Kepler’s late-in-life observing program. K2 was developed after several of Kepler’s gyroscopes (devices that allow a telescope to maintain a consistent orientation in space) had ceased working by 2013 after four years of operations in space, well exceeding their design lifetime. \n\nScientists figured out how to stabilize the telescope’s pointing using the constant pressure of particles streaming from the sun, hopping around from time to time to protect its sensors from solar light. Kepler found its planets using the “transit method,\" which notices when a planet passes in front of its parent star and produces a drop in brightness. \n\nK2 allowed Kepler to observe 100,000 more stars before the telescope ran out of fuel in 2018, including 517 stars that scientists had already spotted planets orbiting. The researchers behind the new study decided to revisit those stars with a new data-processing algorithm.\n\n“Standard search algorithms attempt to identify sudden drops in brightness,” lead author René Heller, an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, said in a statement. “In reality, however, a stellar disk appears slightly darker at the edge than in the center. When a planet moves in front of a star, it therefore initially blocks less starlight than at the mid-time of the transit. The maximum dimming of the star occurs in the center of the transit just before the star becomes gradually brighter again.\"\n\nThe new algorithm attempted to plot a more realistic “light curve,” or pattern of dimming as the planet moves across the face of a distant star. This made it easier to find small planets in the data: The new planets Heller and his colleagues found range from 70% the size of Earth to double our planet’s size. The research team says their new algorithm also makes it somewhat easier to spot small planets amid natural brightness fluctuations of a star, such as those caused by sunspots, and other variables in observation.\n\nMore Earth-size exoplanets might be lurking in the data. Planets that orbit more frequently around a star have a greater chance of being spotted, because they pass in front of the star more often. But planets that are farther away might have gone undetected in the data, since their crossings are less frequent.\n\nThe researchers plan to apply their algorithm to the rest of the Kepler data, and say they may yield up to 100 new Earth-size worlds. \n\nTwo papers based on the research were published this month in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. \n\nCopyright 2019 Space.com, a Future company.

One day, she took a significant risk and shared her distress with her primary care provider, who realized that she needed a behavioral health clinician (BHC). Fortunately, one was \"embedded\" at the same healthcare provider where I work—a concept that is gaining in popularity.\n\nSoon, she eliminated 90 percent of her ritualized behaviors and regained control. If she had not spoken up, and her primary care provider was not equipped to input data and integrate with a BHC, the story might have ended differently.\n\nEvery day, patients visit a health care provider or hospital in order to discuss one or more physical symptoms, when in reality what they may really need is to talk about their mental health.

Whether it is heart disease or cancer or psoriasis, physical ailments are closely connected to mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety.\n\nWhen psychological problems lead to or exacerbate physical symptoms in a traditional “compartmentalized care” setting, it is more likely that the patient’s overall health (mind and body) will be impacted by disconnected treatment. Cardiologists are not skilled psychiatrists, and vice versa, but by coming together in a Collaborative Care Model, they can each be more confident in knowing that their patient is receiving holistic treatment.\n\nThe collaborative care “team” may include a primary care physician, a mental health specialist (social workers, psychiatric nurse practitioners, counselors, psychologists, and psychiatrists), and other physical medicine specialists who may be treating the patient. All team members agree to hold each other accountable and to work in sharing their knowledge of the patient with the overall goal of using this information to ensure the best possible outcome.\n\nEach team member is expected to set goals with the patient that are aligned with and supportive of those from other team members. This model implies that team members share ideas, outcomes (positive or otherwise) and recommendations with each other in a respectful and supportive manner. Finally, the team evaluates the outcomes using validated measures and makes adjustments to the collaborative plan accordingly.  \n\nGaining Traction\n\nResearch around collaborative and integrated care models began in the 1970s, so this is not a new idea, but adoption has been tepid. Fortunately, with more than 80 trials completed, there is greater acceptance of this approach as a well-supported model of care. In true collaborative fashion, many of these trials involved multiple specialties, including OB-GYN, pediatrics and pain management, and studied patients with a range of complex needs. As recently as 2016, the American Psychiatric Association and the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine (since renamed the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry) issued a report and a public statement recommending collaborative care.\n\nOne case study, tracking the impact of collaborative care in a hospital system, demonstrated a 57 percent reduction in depression among primary care patients. Results like these can nudge other health care systems and leaders to adopt technologies and software that facilitate the collaborative care approach.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe benefits of patient-centered collaborative care go beyond better physical and mental health. This approach takes into account the patient’s values, beliefs and preferences while encouraging him or her to actively participate in an individualized treatment plan. Additionally, the economic benefits of collaborative care must not be overlooked. Depression costs employers an estimated $44 billion annually in lost productivity.\n\nAcross all disciplines, we need to find ways to integrate our knowledge and skills so that everyone can engage in such a dynamic and effective mode of care. Despite the positive results from collaborative care models, there is still work to be done to successfully adopt these practices across our health care landscape. I recently joined NeuroFlow, a health care technology company whose goal is to bridge the gap between mental and physical health in all care settings. But currently, fewer than 3 percent of psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners work with primary care physicians in designing and implementing treatment plans for their shared patients. Increasing that percentage would allow many more patients to reaping the benefits.","title":"The Case for Collaborative Care","origin":"Observations","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/8BDE57FC-E1A6-4CB0-A8767E4A905BC518_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&70476F77-DD2A-4270-815BA95FA71D2763","link":"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-case-for-collaborative-care/"},{"authors":"Everyday Einstein Sabrina Stierwalt","pub_date":"May 29, 2019","abstract":"Imagine if we could hop over to our nearest massive galaxy neighbor Andromeda and check out what our Milky Way looks like from the outside.\n\nOr, want to know if the recently discovered Earth-like exoplanet is habitable? Send a probe over to check! The main challenge to space exploration has never been our imagination, or even our ability to come up with new technologies to make space flight possible, but the vastness of space.\n\nIt took 9.5 years for the New Horizons spacecraft just to get to Pluto which is still within our solar system. The nearest star (after our Sun) is more than 26 trillion miles away! Wouldn’t it be convenient if the universe offered us a shortcut?\n\nWhat Is a Wormhole?\n\nTheoretical physicists have hypothesized the existence of such shortcuts through spacetime since the 1930s, originally calling them white holes and eventually Einstein-Rosen bridges. A white hole acts like the reverse of a black hole by emitting energy while not allowing anything to enter. (Black holes, of course, allow matter and energy to enter but, much like the Hotel California, once you enter, you can never leave.) Since the name “Einstein-Rosen bridges” is a bit dry, they became more commonly known as wormholes.\n\nYou can picture a wormhole as a kind of tunnel that connects two points in spacetime. That tunnel could be a straight chute or take a more winding path. If the wormhole is \"traversable\" it acts as a shortcut through spacetime, connecting two points that would otherwise be far apart. Wormholes could connect different spots within a single universe or they can connect different universes.\n\nThe most common way wormholes are depicted is to imagine you are holding a piece of paper that represents normal space. Think of traveling through space as traveling along the sheet of paper. Now mark a point at each end and bend the piece of paper in half, bringing those two points together but without letting them touch. If you were to travel in normal space (i.e. along the sheet of paper) the trip from one of your marks to the other would be longer than if there were a tunnel or a \"wormhole\" connecting the two points on the paper through the empty space between them.\n\nNow the big question—do wormholes really exist?\n\n\n\n»Continue reading “Are Wormholes Real?” on QuickAndDirtyTips.com","title":"Are Wormholes Real?","origin":"Space","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D26FF170-7269-4BCE-A8685B30C003B93D_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&6AF60700-17C6-4B39-A2F4315712F89E98","link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-wormholes-real/"},{"authors":"Robin Verble","pub_date":"May 29, 2019","abstract":"As summer approaches and wildfire season kicks into high gear, we can once again expect a series of heart-wrenching tales about injured animals fleeing from the flames. Accounts of endangered species threatened by these disasters and descriptions of koalas with burned paws tug at our collective heartstrings. But such articles tend to miss the big picture: Fires represent an ecological trade-off. While some species are threatened, others benefit.\n\nIn fact, closer analysis of the scientific literature reveals that koala mortality tends to be highly localized, and resource depletion from intense wildfires only poses short-term effects for koalas: populations will recolonize burned areas a few months after a fire.\n\nIn my work as a fire ecologist who studies the effects of fire on animal populations and community structure, one of the most common questions I am asked is about the risks that such fires pose to wild animals. It is important to remember that for many species, fires aren’t necessarily harmful and, in many cases they may be the key to preserving and restoring habitat. Many animals have evolved techniques to avoid, survive and even thrive on fire-prone areas.  \n\nAdditionally, fires have existed on our landscape for millennia, and these animal species have adapted in the presence of periodic fires. It is only recently, in the face of a multitude of human activities (e.g., deforestation, urbanization, development, increasing carbon emissions, fire suppression) that some species became endangered and that fires became an imminent threat.\n\nIn fact, in many ecosystems, our aggressive suppression of fire degrades habitat and threatens species more than allowing fires to burn; considerations about economics and livelihood obviously are a key part of this decision, but many fires occur in relatively remote areas and are not imminent human threats. Ultimately, your views on wildfire may largely be determined by which animal species you value most\n\nAnd for some species, fires are essential. Saproxylic insects rely on fires to create the best habitat for nest sites. One such deadwood specialist, Melanophila acuminata (known as the fire beetle), has evolved chemical receptors to sense smoke on its antennae and thermal receptors under its wings to detect heat. These adaptations increase its competitive advantage over other early postfire colonizers.\n\nFor the federally endangered American burying beetle (Nicrophorus americanus), fires create the open savanna habitat that it needs to thrive and reproduce. Likewise, the red-cockaded woodpecker and Delmarva fox squirrel both require habitats that are maintained by periodic fires. Large herbivores such a bison maximize their time in recently burned areas, because the regrowing vegetation has a higher nutritional content and increased palatability. Pollinating insects benefit from increased flowering plant growth postfire. These examples are only a few of the many ways in which fires directly benefit wildlife populations.\n\nPerhaps the best case for the importance of fires to wildlife is recent evidence that some animals intentionally spread them. Research by geographer Mark Bonta, then at Pennsylvania State University, and his colleagues documents fire spreading by three species of raptors in Australian savannas. Collectively called the firehawks, these birds have long been known to the indigenous communities in the areas where they occur. The firehawks transport burning sticks in their talons and beaks to unburned areas to ignite fires there. As a result, small mammals and insects fleeing the fires become accessible prey for the birds.\n\nThese birds are distributed on three continents, and there are limited accounts of other species (including the crested caracara in the southern U.S.) that exhibit similar behaviors. The potentially widespread occurrence of this behavior led Bonta and his colleague to speculate that “humanity’s acquisition and manipulation of fire may be a result of the observation of intentional avian pyrophilic behaviour rather than solely from some relationship with lightning-caused fire”.\n\nMost animals are likely to be just fine this fire season, and some will probably welcome the flames. But with rapidly changing fire regimes, in part because of climate change—namely, increases in the length of the fire season and in fire frequency, acreage burned and overall fire intensity—the future impacts on wildlife should be closely monitored.","title":"A Bit of Wildfire Isn’t Necessarily a Bad Thing","origin":"Observations","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/C02761E0-7823-4072-AC082043E8E8F16B_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&7497EF95-D44C-49C8-AE5A246EC80A9C30","link":"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/a-bit-of-wildfire-isnt-necessarily-a-bad-thing/"},{"authors":"Annie Sneed","pub_date":"May 29, 2019","abstract":"A kaleidoscopic diversity of Earth’s plants and animals underpins human existence but is under major threat from the environmental degradation wrought by human activities from mining to agriculture. A million species face extinction—many within decades—without major changes to the way we interact with nature, according to a United Nations–backed report released earlier this month.\n\nBut there is a bright spot: this decline is happening at a slower rate on indigenous peoples’ lands, according to the report, which was compiled by a panel called the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Its authors and other conservation experts say the world should not only draw lessons from those and other local communities’ environmental stewardship but that scientists and policy makers need to support and partner with them in order to stem the tide of biodiversity loss.\n\n“On average, they are doing a better job of managing natural resources and environmental hazards like species decline and pollution,” says Pamela McElwee, one of the report’s lead authors and an associate professor of human ecology at Rutgers University. “This is a watershed moment in acknowledging that indigenous and local communities play really important roles in maintaining and managing biodiversity and landscapes that the rest of us can learn from.”\n\nStewards of Biodiversity\n\nThe report says at least a quarter of our planet’s land is owned, used, occupied or managed by indigenous peoples. And that includes 35 percent of terrestrial areas with very low human impacts, as well as approximately 35 percent of lands under formal protection. The numbers would rise even higher if groups the report designates as “local communities”—considered nonindigenous, but with strong ties to the land through livelihood and other factors—were included. “We have always been saying that if you really look at it, indigenous peoples manage very large areas of biodiversity. But to have governments accept that, and to make it one of the major findings of the report, is quite significant,” says Joji Carino, who is Ibaloi-Igorot from the Philippines’ Cordilleras Highlands and a senior policy adviser of the Forest Peoples Programme. This nonprofit human rights organization works with indigenous peoples, particularly in tropical forest countries.\n\nThe report found that indigenous and local communities contribute in many significant ways to biodiversity. By combining wild and domestic species in gardens, for example, they have created habitats that are much more diverse and species-rich than typical agricultural landscapes—which are often vast fields with acre upon acre of the same crop. “In some cases, there are 300 or 500 species in a garden,” says Zsolt Molnár, a coordinating lead author of the IPBES global assessment and an ethnoecologist at the MTA Center for Ecological Research in Hungary. Many indigenous and local communities actively manage their lands, such as through traditional burning practices that promote biodiversity in places including Australia. They also carry out ecological restoration of degraded lands, such as in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, where indigenous communities have been involved in restoring shellfish populations and native plant species.\n\nIndigenous peoples and local communities also play an important role in long-term monitoring of ecosystems. This is critical, especially because some of these groups live in remote, hard-to-reach areas, such as the Arctic or Amazon forest. “It’s really [these communities] that are collecting the data, often through everyday experiences, so they can report back trends for species, population numbers over time, interactions between species, noticeable declines,” McElwee says. “That monitoring role can be really important, particularly where we don’t have a long-term scientific presence.” For example, indigenous communities in the semipolar regions of the U.S. and Canada have collaborated with those countries on the Local Environmental Observer network, which collects observations on everything from temperatures to wildlife sightings.\n\nOften, though, scientists and governments have not recognized—or have even denigrated—the contributions of indigenous and local communities to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem health. In Hungary, for instance, traditional herders had long allowed livestock to graze grasslands, which helped promote biodiversity by maintaining the balance of plant species. But when the country established national parks several decades ago, government authorities often discouraged, restricted or even outright banned traditional grazing on grasslands. “The problem was that science had no understanding of traditional herding and its impacts,” Molnár says. It is only over the last couple decades that government authorities and scientists have recognized herders’ crucial role in grassland management and have started reintroducing and supporting traditional grazing in the parks.\n\nA Different View of Nature\n\nIndigenous and local communities tend to succeed at conservation for a number of reasons, say experts such as Eduardo Brondízio, co-chair of the IPBES global assessment and an anthropologist at Indiana University Bloomington. These communities have long histories with their lands, which have provided sustenance in a very direct and intimate way. “When you understand the potential uses and the values of hundreds of species, you see a forest differently than if you don’t recognize that,” he says. Social norms and rules can also help communities regulate their natural resources. “It’s about [viewing] the landscape not only from the perspective of just agriculture or ranging,” Brondízio notes. “Instead of focusing on a single management issue, they look at the function of landscapes and what is important to keep in terms of connectivity, how different habitats can be managed to complement each other.”\n\nThey also tend to have a deeper understanding of local ecosystems and their dynamics, and this can help make better-informed management decisions. “Community-based institutions are often more successful than government policies or institutions (like formal protected areas) simply because they are closer to the ground and can respond more quickly to changes or threats,” McElwee says.\n\nIn addition, many indigenous and local communities tend have a reciprocal relationship with nature, rather than viewing nature as existing to serve humans—as much of Western culture has historically regarded things. “The institutions, the cultural values, the way of living and the way you see nature itself—as [inseparable] from your social life and identity—that creates a different view of what to use, how to use and how to deal with the tradeoffs of use,” Brondízio says. As McElwee notes, “Even if we don’t acknowledge it, the water we drink, the air we breathe, the food we produce—it all depends on healthy ecosystems. That is a lesson we can learn from indigenous peoples and local communities who know this already, and who are actively conserving and managing lands.”\n\nExperts say indigenous and local knowledge is—and will be—a critical part of protecting the planet’s biodiversity and the overall health of our ecosystems. This means governments and scientists need to be allies with these communities by amplifying their voices, including them in scientific assessments, recognizing territorial rights and creating partnerships between scientists and indigenous and local communities. “One of the big points is that governments really have to respect our knowledge, values and innovations,” Carino says. “As well as recognize land tenure systems, access rights, and so on.”\n\nAt the same time, many of these communities and their lands face immense threats. They are dealing with pressures from encroaching infrastructure, agriculture, mining, logging and other activities that also endanger biodiversity. There are internal pressures as well, Brondízio says. “Poverty is a major issue among indigenous and local communities,” he explains, adding that this can put pressure on their natural resources or allow outsiders to exploit communities.\n\nStandard conservation practices can present a threat too, experts including Molnár and Carino say. “There are many bad examples where indigenous territories were appropriated by the government, declared a protected area, and indigenous peoples were translocated or just simply killed,” explains Molnár, pointing to the example of the Ogiek, who were evicted from their homes on Mount Elgon in Kenya. “If we want indigenous peoples to become allies in the protection of biodiversity, then we have to respect their rights,” he says. Carino agrees. “Really, the whole way of conservation in the future needs to be rethought,” she says. “It has to be conservation with respect for human rights of the peoples who are living there, who are managing these areas.”","title":"What Conservation Efforts Can Learn from Indigenous Communities","origin":"Conservation","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/05442AF1-C7D1-4275-A0FA4B76C7156C68_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&946CA797-B9F4-490D-B11D754633CCA1EC","link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-conservation-efforts-can-learn-from-indigenous-communities/"},{"authors":"Jacob Carter, Anita Desikan, Gretchen Goldman","pub_date":"May 29, 2019","abstract":"Does it feel like science has been under attack in federal policy lately? It isn’t your imagination. As of this month, the Trump administration has attacked science more than 100 times—more than any other administration since the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) began tracking.\n\nBefore Donald Trump came along, George W. Bush’s administration posed the biggest threat to public health and safety, with a documented 98 attacks on science, according to our count. But while those attacks happened over eight years, the Trump administration topped them in a mere two and a half years. The Bush administration was no friend to federal scientists or their work. Indeed, for a long period of time, it was widely regarded by many to be the most antagonistic administration toward science and science policy in modern history.\n\nOnly three years into Bush’s first term, his administration’s assaults on science prompted a group of senior scientists who had advised every Republican and Democratic administration dating to President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s to pen a letter protesting these actions., which was entitled “Restoring Scientific Integrity in Policy Making The statement accumulated signatures by around 15,000 scientists, including 20 Nobel laureates, over the next four years. The antiscience actions taken by the Bush administration are largely why science-based federal agencies now have scientific-integrity policies in place to deter political interference in federal science.\n\nThe 98 political attacks that UCS documented on the federal science apparatus during the Bush years run the gamut from censoring the ability of federal scientists to speak about their work, to altering scientific information in reports and government Web sites, to downplaying the effects of climate change, to disbanding scientific advisory committees.\n\nThese strategies are not new. We have seen nearly every administration in modern history politicize science to promote its own political agenda. This politicization has occurred because science is powerful. It is easier to win political arguments if science is on your side. But that benefit makes science vulnerable to interference and misuse for political purposes. President Barack Obama’s administration, for example, failed to set a science-based ozone standard and defied its own Food and Drug Administration scientists’ judgment by restricting access to emergency contraceptives.\n\nEven though we expected the Trump administration to be destructive to federal science, we had no idea that the size of the wrecking ball would be this big. While we have now documented 100 attacks on science under the Trump administration, it is difficult to know if Presidents Bush and Obama were subject to the same level of scrutiny and whether the exact same lens was applied for all administrations with different political contexts and decisions in our count, it is clear that President Trump and his political appointees have escalated their attacks on science by making them in a mere fraction of the time it took the Bush administration.\n\nAnd the worst is probably yet to come. The administration is likely to sideline science and push antiscience actions through the federal government’s bureaucratic process at an even greater rate as President Trump’s first term comes to an end in January 2021.\n\nThe Trump administration’s unprecedented record on science will harm people across the country, especially the most disenfranchised. While the sheer number of attacks on science is shocking, what a lack of science-informed policy means for our country is even more shocking. The administration’s rollback of protections from exposure to dangerous chemicals means that more people will become ill, develop chronic diseases or die from encountering these hazardous substances.\n\nThe safety of workers is at risk as the administration ignores scientific evidence showing things such as the fact that making people conduct work faster on poultry lines results in more workplace injuries. More children are likely to suffer from asthma and respiratory illnesses as the administration sidelines epidemiological evidence that air pollution has negative effects on our health.\n\nIt’s no surprise that millions of scientists and supporters have taken to the streets to push back against these attacks on science. The scientific community has stood up to the Trump administration’s antiscience actions with much success. A good example comes from an early 2018 issue when Trump administration officials blocked the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) from publishing a draft toxicology report on a class of potentially hazardous chemicals commonly found in drinking water and groundwater. The chemicals, known collectively as PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are linked with numerous adverse health effects, including liver damage, kidney cancer and increased cholesterol.\n\nWe obtained e-mails showing that the White House purposefully blocked the report’s release because of concern about a “potential public relations nightmare.” The report found that the current standards of risk for this class of chemicals was outdated. After the story broke, UCS and other nonprofits organized scientists and supporters to deliver 18,000 messages to their representatives to put a spotlight on the issue. Thanks to this pressure, the ATSDR released the report in June 2018. The report suggested a much more stringent standard for PFAS exposure, citing health concerns for even low levels of the chemicals.\n\nThis unprecedented milestone means there is more work to do. Congress should join with scientists and their supporters to stop the Trump administration’s antiscience actions. One way for congresspeople to do so is to place their support behind the Scientific Integrity Act, which would codify many provisions within scientific integrity policies maintained by federal agencies with science-based missions, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior. The act could prevent many of the attacks on science that we have seen from the administration to date, meaning it could stop many unforeseeable ones from this and future administrations. This safeguard will help us better protect the health and safety of people and our environment.","title":"The Trump Administration Has Attacked Science 100 Times ... and Counting","origin":"Observations","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/8506F3EA-D151-48D1-851F742AB82555DB_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&0EF67B1C-C77E-4FE9-8F9C5C4A4892F59A","link":"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-trump-administration-has-attacked-science-100-times-and-counting/"},{"authors":"Chelsea Harvey, E&E News","pub_date":"May 30, 2019","abstract":"In October 2016, a tiny island in the frigid waters between Russia and Alaska was the site of a morbid mystery. Dozens of dead seabirds began suddenly washing up on the shore. The bodies continued to arrive for months.\n\nIt was a jolt to the local residents of St. Paul Island, northernmost of a group of four volcanic formations known as the Pribilof Islands, clustered in the icy Bering Sea. While dead animals might occasionally wash up under normal circumstances, the daily bombardments of sodden carcasses were clearly the mark of a mass die-off. More remarkably, most of the birds were tufted puffins, a species that rarely washes up dead on the island at all.\n\nPerhaps most disturbingly of all were the birds’ emaciated bodies; they likely starved to death.\n\nShortly after the bodies began to appear, scientists started speculating that the die-off might be linked to climate change. Now, new research published this week in the journal PLOS ONE reiterates this theory—and suggests the event may have killed thousands of puffins across the Bering Sea.\n\nLed by Timothy Jones of the University of Washington, the researchers used special models to simulate the way winds and waves carry objects through the Bering Sea and deposit them on the shore of St. Paul. These simulations helped highlight the number of carcasses that were actually found washed up on the beach, versus the number that were swept back out to sea before they could be counted—and the number that never made it onto shore at all.\n\nMore than 300 carcasses were recovered on the shoreline. Using their simulations, however, the researchers estimate that anywhere from 3,150 to 8,800 birds likely died in the event. Most of them were probably puffins.\n\nAnalyses on a handful of the bodies found that toxins, often the suspected culprit in mass animal die-offs, were not to blame. Instead, it appeared most of the birds starved to death. Many of them were molting, the researchers note—an energy-intensive process that can make birds more vulnerable to stressors like food shortages.\n\nThe food stress itself is likely being driven by changes in the Arctic related to global warming, scientists say.\n\nIn their new paper, Jones and his colleagues point out that climate-driven changes in the Bering Sea, from rising water temperature to vanishing sea ice, are affecting the abundance and distribution of fish and other marine organisms. Those are important food sources for puffins and other seabirds. They suggest these changes triggered the 2016 die-off.\n\nThe Arctic as a whole is one of the most rapidly changing regions of the Earth. It’s warming about twice as fast as the rest of the planet on average. And the Bering Sea, in particular, is undergoing one of the most noticeable transformations. Over the last few years, water temperatures have been higher than usual and its sea ice cover has declined dramatically—even in winter, when the ice should be at its greatest extent.\n\nThat decline is already having a significant effect on the Bering Sea ecosystem, according to Robert Foy, director of NOAA’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center, who commented on the study for E&E News. There are fewer fish than there used to be, and many of the fish that remain are in poorer condition, with lower fat content, making them less nutritious for the bigger animals that eat them.\n\n“We have found substantial movement patterns in some of the pollock and cod stocks from the southeastern Bering Sea to the northeastern Bering Sea, where upwards of 50% of the cod stock may have shifted distribution towards the north,” he said.\n\nIn general, Foy said, it’s “very plausible” that changing conditions in the Bering Sea are to blame for the 2016 mass mortality event. And it’s probably not the only die-off linked to recent climate change in the Arctic and the northern Pacific.\n\nDuring the winter of 2014 through 2015, for instance, thousands of Cassin’s auklets washed up dead on the shores from California up to British Columbia. Scientists also believe that starvation, linked to warm ocean temperatures and a recent change in prey availability, was to blame. Between 2015 and 2018, scientists also recorded several seabird die-off events, affecting multiple species, in the Gulf of Alaska and the Chukchi and Bering seas.\n\nPuffins, in particular, have begun to garner increasing concern, and not only off the coast of Alaska. The New York Times reported in 2018 that puffin colonies in Iceland and other parts of the North Atlantic also seem to be suffering recent declines linked to food shortages, and scientists are working to determine how much of it is linked to the impact of climate change.\n\nIn the Bering Sea, the most dramatic trends have occurred within the last five years or so, meaning “the question remains what will happen if that colder water returns in future years,” Foy noted.\n\nBut in the long term, models project a continued increase in water temperatures and marine heat waves, as well as continued declines in Arctic sea ice. And there’s concern that as Arctic ecosystems continue to adjust, seabirds and other animals may become more vulnerable.\n\n“Experts around the world expect that we will see more events such as these heat wave events,” Foy noted. “And the likely effect is, as the authors [of the new study] state, the potential for these large scale die-offs.”\n\nReprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&E News.

It will come as no surprise to learn that research has established that physical appearance is one factor that predicts attraction. This is starkly evident in online dating. A study of thirty-somethings found that being rated in the top (versus bottom) ten percent on physical attractiveness roughly tripled the probability of receiving a “first-contact” message (Hi! How are you?). Like it or not, looks matter in the dating game.  \n\nBut do not despair if you don’t have movie-star good looks. Intelligence predicts attraction, too—and not only in humans, it turns out. In a study just published in Science, a team of scientists in China and the Netherlands showed that female parakeets showed greater preference for males that they observed demonstrating problem-solving skill. This finding provides the most direct support to date for the evolutionary hypothesis, first advanced by Charles Darwin himself, that mate selection is one way that human intelligence has evolved.\n\nAt the beginning of the experiment, male and female parakeets (also known as budgerigars) were randomly assigned to either a problem-solving group or a control group. In both groups, the birds were tested in a specially designed cage in triads consisting of a “focal” female and two “demonstrator” males. The cage was divided into three compartments by transparent screens: a main compartment, where the female was placed, and side compartments, where the males were placed. The female had perches in the middle of her compartment (the “neutral zone”) and on either end (the “preference zones”). Over four days of observation, the male near which she spent more of her time was identified as the “preferred” male and the other one as the “less-preferred” male.\n\nNext, the birds were taken out of the testing cage. In the problem-solving group, over the course of a week, the less-preferred male was given training in two “puzzle box” tasks in which the goal was to access birdseed. The first puzzle box required the bird to open a petri dish; the second one required him to open the lid to the box, pull open a door, and pull out a drawer. (The preferred male received no training.) All three birds were then put back into the testing cage for an “observing phase” in which both males attempted to open the puzzle boxes in view of the female. In the control group, the focal female simply observed the less-preferred male eating out of a regular food dish. Finally, the scientists once again measured the female’s preference for the males.\n\nThe results supported Darwin’s hypothesis. In the problem-solving group, the females’ preferences shifted. Most of the females now preferred the skilled (and previously less-preferred) male, all but ignoring the unskilled (and previously preferred) male. (Intelligence was, to borrow from the psychologist Timothy Leary, the “ultimate aphrodisiac” for these lady birds.) By contrast, in the control group, the females’ preferences were unchanged. This finding indicates that it was the demonstration of problem-solving skill related to foraging, and not mere access to food, that caused females’ preferences to shift. As a follow-up, the researchers repeated the experiment with all female birds. There was no preference shift to the skilled female. Thus, the key result was specific to males and was presumably driven by mate selection.\n\nHumans are obviously more complex creatures than parakeets, but mate selection may be a factor in the evolution of human intelligence, as well. Intelligence predicts people’s ability to survive and thrive in their environments. Smart people tend to live long, healthy, productive lives. Consequently, we may have evolved to become attracted to people whose behavior signals high intelligence. For the single among us, there’s practical message here for dating: make yourself look nice, but don’t forget about the intelligent conversation.","title":"Looks Matters, but so Does Smarts","origin":"Behavior & Society","image":"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/32920834-8CBF-4170-94E746035674357C_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&F555B73F-8D9B-4618-82F678592F452041","link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/looks-matters-but-so-does-smarts/"}]
