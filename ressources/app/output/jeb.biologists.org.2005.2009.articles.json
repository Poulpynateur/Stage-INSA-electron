        "abstract": "We assessed the hydration state of antlers and its effect on antler mechanical properties compared with wet femur. Red deer antlers were removed from the head at various times, from a few days after velvet shedding till late in the season, and weighed weekly until after casting time. Antlers cut just after losing their velvet lost weight rapidly in the first few weeks, then settled down and changed weight very little, the latter changes correlating with air relative humidity. Antlers cut later showed little weight change at any time. The water content of cortical and trabecular parts of the contralateral antler was assessed after cutting. Most of the weight loss was from the cancellous, not the cortical, part of the antler. Wet and dry specimens from the antlers, and wet specimens from deer femora, were tested mechanically. Compared with wet bone, wet antler had a much lower modulus of elasticity and bending strength, but a higher work to fracture. Compared with wet bone, dry antler showed a somewhat lower Young's modulus, but a considerably higher bending strength and a much higher work to fracture. The impact energy absorption of dry antler was much greater than that of wet bone. In red deer, the antler is effectively dry during its use in fights, at least in southern Spain. In addition, dry antler, compared with ordinary bone, shows mechanical properties that suit it admirably for its fighting function.",

        "abstract": "Anhydrobiosis is a highly stable state of suspended animation in an organism due to its desiccation, which is followed by recovery after rehydration. Changes occurring during drying could damage molecules, including DNA. Using the anhydrobiotic tardigrade Paramacrobiotus richtersi as a model organism, we have evaluated the effects of environmental factors, such as temperature and air humidity level (RH), on the survival of desiccated animals and on the degradation of their DNA. Tardigrades naturally desiccated in leaf litter and tardigrades experimentally desiccated on blotting paper were considered. Replicates were kept at 37°C and at different levels of RH for 21 days. RH values and temperature, as well as time of exposure to these environmental factors, have a negative effect on tardigrade survival and on the time required by animals to recover active life after desiccation. DNA damages (revealed as single strand breaks) occurred only in desiccated tardigrades kept for a long time at high RH values. These results indicate that during the anhydrobiotic state, damages take place and accumulate with time. Two hypotheses can be formulated to explain the results: (i) oxidative damages occur in desiccated specimens of P. richtersi, and (ii) high temperatures and high RH values change the state of the disaccharide trehalose, reducing its protective role.",

We have developed and validated rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to the NKA α1a and α1b protein isoforms of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Linnaeus), and used western blots and immunohistochemistry to characterize their size, abundance and localization. The relative molecular mass of NKA α1a is slightly less than that for NKA β1b. The abundance of gill NKA α1a was high in freshwater and became nearly undetectable after seawater acclimation. NKA α1b was present in small amounts in freshwater and increased 13-fold after seawater acclimation. Both NKA isoforms were detected only in chloride cells. NKA α1a was located in both filamental and lamellar chloride cells in freshwater, whereas in seawater it was present only as a faint background in filamental chloride cells. In freshwater, NKA α1b was found in a small number of filamental chloride cells, and after seawater acclimation it was found in all chloride cells on the filament and lamellae. Double simultaneous immunofluorescence indicated that NKA α1a and α1b are located in different chloride cells in freshwater. In many chloride cells in seawater, NKA α1b was present in greater amounts in the subapical region than elsewhere in the cell. The combined patterns in abundance and immunolocalization of these two isoforms can explain the salinity-related changes in total NKA and chloride cell abundance. The results indicate that there is a freshwater and a seawater isoform of NKA α-subunit in the gills of Atlantic salmon and that they are present in distinct chloride cells.",

Ormia females home in on the male cricket's songs and deposit larvae, which burrow into the cricket, feed and emerge to pupate. Because male crickets call at night, gravid female Ormia in search of hosts are subject to bat predation, in much the same way as female crickets are when responding to male song. We show that Ormia has evolved the same evasive behavior as have crickets: an acoustic startle response to bat-like ultrasound that manifests clearly only during flight. Furthermore, like crickets, Ormia has a sharp response boundary between the frequencies of song and bat cries, resembling categorical perception first described in the context of human speech.",

While a number of environmental cues have been proposed to play a role in the navigation of birds, arguments still persist about which cues are essential for the experience based navigation shown by adult migrants. To date, few studies have tested the sensory basis of navigational cues used during actual migration in the wild: mainly laboratory based studies or homing during the non-migratory season have been used to investigate this behaviour. Here we tested the role of olfactory and magnetic cues in the migration of the catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) by radio tracking the migration of birds with sensory manipulations during their actual migratory flights. Our data suggest that adult birds treated with zinc sulphate to produce anosmia were unable to show the same orientation as control adults, and instead reverted to a direction similar to that shown by juveniles making their first migration. The magnetic manipulation had no effect on the orientation of either adults or juveniles. These results allow us to propose that the olfactory sense may play a role in experience based migration in adult catbirds. While the olfactory sense has been shown to play a role in the homing of pigeons and other birds, this is the first time it has been implicated in migratory orientation.",

        "abstract": "Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) generate wide jaw gapes when gouging trees with their anterior teeth to elicit tree exudate flow. Closely related cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) do not gouge trees but share similar diets including exudates. Maximizing jaw opening theoretically compromises the bite forces that marmosets can generate during gouging. To investigate how jaw-muscle architecture and craniofacial position impact muscle performance during gouging, we combine skull and jaw-muscle architectural features to model muscle force production across a range of jaw gapes in these two species. We incorporate joint mechanics, resting sarcomere length and muscle architecture estimates from the masseter and temporalis to model muscle excursion, sarcomere length and relative tension as a function of joint angle. Muscle excursion from occlusion to an estimated maximum functional gape of 55 deg. was smaller in all regions of the masseter and temporalis of C. jacchus compared with S. oedipus except the posterior temporalis. As a consequence of reduced muscle excursion distributed over more sarcomeres in series (i.e. longer fibers), sarcomere length operating ranges are smaller in C. jacchus jaw muscles across this range of gapes. This configuration allows C. jacchus to act on a more favorable portion of the length—tension curve at larger gapes and thereby generate relatively greater tension in these muscles compared with S. oedipus. Our results suggest that biting performance during tree gouging in common marmosets is improved by a musculoskeletal configuration that reduces muscle stretch at wide gapes while simultaneously facilitating comparatively large muscle forces at the extremes of jaw opening.",

        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLES",
        "abstract": "Storage of elastic energy is key to increasing the power output of many biological systems. Mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda) must store considerable elastic energy prior to their rapid raptorial strikes; however, little is known about the dynamics and location of elastic energy storage structures in this system. We used computed tomography (CT) to visualize the mineralization patterns in Gonodactylaceus falcatus and high speed videography of Odontodactylus scyllarus to observe the dynamics of spring loading. Using a materials testing apparatus, we measured the force and work required to contract the elastic structures in G. falcatus. There was a positive linear correlation between contraction force and contraction distance; alternative model tests further supported the use of a linear model. Therefore, we modeled the system as a Hookean spring. The force required to fully compress the spring was positively correlated with body mass and appendage size, but the spring constant did not scale with body size, suggesting a possible role of muscle constraints in the scaling of this system. One hypothesized elastic storage structure, the saddle, only contributed approximately 11% of the total measured force, thus suggesting that primary site of elastic energy storage is in the mineralized ventral bars found in the merus segment of the raptorial appendages. Furthermore, the intact system exhibited 81% resilience and severing the saddle resulted in a non-significant reduction to 77% resilience. The remarkable shapes and mineralization patterns that characterize the mantis shrimp's raptorial appendage further reveal a highly integrated mechanical power amplification system based on exoskeletal elastic energy storage.",

        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLES",
        "abstract": "Air-breathing marine animals, including sea turtles, utilise two fundamentally different environments (i.e. sea surface and underwater) during migration. Many satellite telemetry studies have shown travel paths at relatively large spatio-temporal scales, discussing the orientation and navigation mechanisms that guide turtles. However, as travel paths obtained by satellite telemetry only reflect movements at the surface, little is known about movements and orientation ability underwater. In this study, to assess orientation ability both at the surface and underwater, fine-scale 3-D movements of free-ranging loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta were reconstructed by using multi-sensor data loggers. Video systems (‘Crittercam’) were also used to record the behaviour of the turtles and the visual information surrounding the turtles. During August and October in 2006 and 2007, eight turtles were released from Otsuchi Bay, Japan (39°20′30N, 141°56′00E), and a total of 118 h of 3-D movements were reconstructed. Turtles maintained highly straight-line courses (straightness index >0.95) during 41% of the total duration (i.e. ‘travelling periods’). During travelling periods, turtles swam continuously, maintaining unidirectional heading throughout dives whereas turtles changed heading remarkably at the surface. Despite highly directional movements during dives, travel direction tended to shift by the end of dives lasting 10 minutes or more. Such deflections seemed to be compensated during subsequent surfacing periods because there was a negative relationship between changes in travel direction arising during dives and subsequent surfacing periods. Therefore, remarkable changes in heading at the surface could be interpreted as direction-searching behaviour. Our results suggested that turtles undertaking directional travel were more dependent on directional information that was reliable at the surface.",

        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLES",
        "abstract": "Among insects, learning is particularly well studied in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the honeybee Apis mellifera. A senescence-dependent decline in classic pavlovian conditioning is demonstrated for both species. To understand how aging affects learning, genetic approaches used with Drosophila can benefit from complementary studies in Apis. Specifically, honeybees have a larger brain size allowing for compartment-specific approaches, and a unique life-history plasticity. They usually perform within-nest tasks early in life (nest bees) and later they collect food (foragers). Senescence of learning performance is a function of the bees' foraging duration but underlying causes are poorly understood. As cognitive aging is commonly associated with structural and biochemical changes in the brain, we hypothesized that brain areas implicated in learning change in synaptic and biochemical composition with increased foraging duration. First, we used synapse-specific immunohistochemistry and proteomics to screen for alterations in the calyx region of the mushroom body, a key structure for memory formation. Using proteomics, we next profiled the central brain, which comprises all higher-order integration centers. We show that, with increased foraging duration, levels of kinases, synaptic- and neuronal growth-related proteins decline in the central brain while the calyx region remains intact both in structure and biochemistry. We suggest that proteome-level changes within major anatomical sites of memory formation other than the calyx region could be central to learning dysfunction. These include large compartments of the central brain, such as the mushroom body's output regions and the antennal lobes. Our data provide novel information toward heterogeneity in the aging insect brain, and demonstrate advantages of the honeybee for invertebrate neurogerontological research.",

However, the biomechanics of feeding in cetaceans has been relatively ignored by functional biologists. This study investigated the feeding behavior, kinematics and pressure generation of three odontocetes with varying feeding modes (belugas, Delphinapterus leucas; Pacific white-sided dolphins, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens; and long-finned pilot whales, Globicephala melas). Four feeding phases were recognized in all odontocetes: (I) preparatory, (II) jaw opening, (III) gular depression, and (IV) jaw closing. Belugas relied on a feeding mode that was composed of discrete ram and suction components. Pacific white-sided dolphins fed using ram, with some suction for compensation or manipulation of prey. Pilot whales were kinematically similar to belugas but relied on a combination of ram and suction that was less discrete than belugas. Belugas were able to purse the anterior lips to occlude lateral gape and form a small, circular anterior aperture that is convergent with feeding behaviors observed in more basal vertebrates. Suction generation in odontocetes is a function of hyolingual displacement and rapid jaw opening, and is likely to be significantly enhanced by lip pursing behaviors. Some degree of subambient pressure was measured in all species, with belugas reaching 126 kPa. Functional variations of suction generation during feeding demonstrate a wider diversity of feeding behaviors in odontocetes than previously thought. However, odontocete suction generation is convergent with that of more basal aquatic vertebrates.",

Multiple photoreceptor systems, three of the four eye types, plus the rhopalial neuropil, affect the swim pacemaker. The lower lens eye inhibits the pacemaker when stimulated and provokes a strong increase in the pacemaker frequency upon light-off. The upper lens eye, the pit eyes and the rhopalial neuropil all have close to the opposite effect. When these responses are compared with all-eye stimulations it is seen that some advanced integration must take place.",

Despite its apparent ubiquitous conservation in decapod crustaceans, the paracrine and/or endocrine roles played by pQDLDHVFLRFamide remain largely unknown. We have examined the actions of this peptide on the cardiac neuromuscular system of the American lobster Homarus americanus using four preparations: the intact animal, the heart in vitro, the isolated cardiac ganglion (CG), and a stimulated heart muscle preparation. In the intact animal, injection of myosuppressin caused a decrease in heartbeat frequency. Perfusion of the in vitro heart with pQDLDHVFLRFamide elicited a decrease in the frequency and an increase in the amplitude of heart contractions. In the isolated CG, myosuppressin induced a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential of cardiac motor neurons and a decrease in the cycle frequency of their bursting. In the stimulated heart muscle preparation, pQDLDHVFLRFamide increased the amplitude of the induced contractions, suggesting that myosuppressin modulates not only the CG, but also peripheral sites. For at least the in vitro heart and the isolated CG, the effects of myosuppressin were dose-dependent (10−9 to 10−6 mol l−1 tested), with threshold concentrations (10−8−10−7 mol l−1) consistent with the peptide serving as a circulating hormone. Although cycle frequency, a parameter directly determined by the CG, consistently decreased when pQDLDHVFLRFamide was applied to all preparation types, the magnitudes of this decrease differed, suggesting the possibility that, because myosuppressin modulates the CG and the periphery, it also alters peripheral feedback to the CG.",

To determine how such variation in environmental temperature may impact energetic costs in otariids, we determined the thermal neutral zone of adult and juvenile California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) by measuring resting metabolic rate using open-flow respirometry. Five adult female (body mass range =82.2-107.2 kg) and four juvenile (body mass=26.2-36.5 kg) sea lions were examined over experimental water temperatures ranging from 0 to 20°C (adults) or 5 to 20°C (juveniles). The metabolic rate of adult sea lions averaged 6.4±0.64 ml O2 kg−1 min−1 when resting within the thermal neutral zone. The lower critical temperature of adults was 6.4±2.2°C, approximately 4°C lower than sea surface temperatures routinely encountered off coastal California. In comparison, juvenile sea lions did not demonstrate thermal neutrality within the range of water temperatures examined. Resting metabolic rate of the younger animals, 6.3±0.53 ml O2 kg−1 min−1, increased as water temperature approached 12°C, and suggested a potential thermal limitation in the wild. To determine whether muscle thermogenesis during activity could mitigate this limitation, we measured the active metabolic rate of juveniles swimming at water temperature (Twater)=5, 12 and 20°C. No significant difference (F=0.377, P=0.583) in swimming metabolic rate was found among water temperatures, suggesting that thermal disadvantages due to small body size in juvenile sea lions may be circumvented by recycling endogenous heat during locomotor activity.",

Each eye has two retinas: a distal retina that is closer to the lens, and a proximal retina that lies directly underneath. The distal retinas of E1 and E2 are made of a dorsal and a ventral stack of at least twelve photoreceptor layers. Could this arrangement be used to compensate for lens chromatic aberration, with shorter wavelengths detected by the distal layers and longer wavelengths by the proximal layers? To answer this question we molecularly identified opsins and their expression patterns in these eyes. We found three opsin-encoding genes. The distal retinas of all six eyes express long-wavelength opsin (TmLW) mRNA, whereas the proximal retinas express ultraviolet opsin (TmUV I) mRNA. In the proximal retinas of E1 and E2, the TmUV I mRNA is expressed only in the dorsal stack. A second ultraviolet opsin mRNA (TmUV II), is expressed in the proximal retinas of E1 and E2 (both stacks). The finding that longer-wavelength opsins are expressed distally to shorter-wavelength opsins makes it unlikely that this retinal arrangement is used to compensate for lens chromatic aberration. In addition, we also described opsin expression patterns in the medial retina of E1 and in the non-tiered retina of the lensless eye patch. To our knowledge, this is also the first report of multiple UV opsins being expressed in the same stemma.",

        "abstract": "The biogenic amine tyramine (TA) is a potent diuretic factor when applied to the Malpighian tubule (MT) of Drosophila melanogaster, stimulating both urine production and transepithelial chloride conductance. Isolated MTs can respond not only to TA but also to its precursor, tyrosine; this observation led to the proposal that MTs are able to synthesize TA from applied tyrosine through the action of the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC). In the current study it is shown that the non-neuronal isoform of TDC, Tdc1, is expressed in the principal cells of the MT. A mutant allele of Tdc1, Tdc1f03311, was identified that reduced expression of the mature Tdc1 transcript by greater than 100-fold. MTs isolated from Tdc1f03311 homozygous flies showed no significant depolarization of their transepithelial potential (TEP) or diuresis in response to tyrosine while retaining normal sensitivity to TA. By contrast, a previously identified null mutant allele of the neuronal TDC isoform Tdc2 had no effect on either tyrosine or TA sensitivity. To determine in which cell type of the MT Tdc1 expression is required, flies were generated carrying a UAS-Tdc1 transgene and cell-type-specific Gal4 drivers on a Tdc1f03311 homozygous background. Rescue of Tdc1 expression in principal cells fully restored sensitivity to tyrosine whereas expression of Tdc1 in stellate cells had no rescuing effect. It is concluded that synthesis of TA by Tdc1 in the principal cells of the MT is required for physiological responses to tyrosine. TA synthesis in the MT is the first reported physiological role for Drosophila Tdc1.",

        "abstract": "Honeybee (Apis mellifera) society is characterized by a helper caste of essentially sterile female bees called workers. Workers show striking changes in lifespan that correlate with changes in colony demography. When rearing sibling sisters (brood), workers survive for 3-6 weeks. When brood rearing declines, worker lifespan is 20 weeks or longer. Insects can survive unfavorable periods on endogenous stores of protein and lipid. The glyco-lipoprotein vitellogenin extends worker bee lifespan by functioning in free radical defense, immunity and behavioral control. Workers use vitellogenin in brood food synthesis, and the metabolic cost of brood rearing (nurse load) may consume vitellogenin stores and reduce worker longevity. Yet, in addition to consuming resources, brood secretes a primer pheromone that affects worker physiology and behavior. Odors and odor perception can influence invertebrate longevity but it is unknown whether brood pheromone modulates vitellogenin stores and survival. We address this question with a 2-factorial experiment where 12 colonies are exposed to combinations of absence vs presence of brood and brood pheromone. Over an age-course of 24 days, we monitor the amount of vitellogenin stored in workers' fat body (adipose tissue). Thereafter, we track colony survival for 200 days. We demonstrate that brood rearing reduces worker vitellogenin stores and colony long-term survival. Yet also, we establish that the effects can result solely from exposure to brood pheromone. These findings indicate that molecular systems of extreme lifespan regulation are integrated with the sensory system of honeybees to respond to variation in a primer pheromone secreted from larvae.",

        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLES",
        "abstract": "Sea turtles are known to detect chemical cues, but in contrast to most marine animals, turtles surface to breathe and thus potentially have access to olfactory cues both in air and in water. To determine whether sea turtles can detect airborne chemical cues, captive loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) were placed into a circular, water-filled arena in which odorants could be introduced to the air above the water surface. Air that had passed across the surface of a cup containing food elicited increased activity, diving and other behavior normally associated with feeding. By contrast, air that had passed across the surface of an identical cup containing distilled water elicited no response. Increases in activity during food odor trials occurred only after turtles surfaced to breathe and peaked in the first post-breath minute, implying that the chemical cues eliciting the responses were unlikely to have been detected while the turtles were under water. These results provide the first direct evidence that sea turtles can detect airborne odors. Under natural conditions, this sensory ability might function in foraging, navigation or both.",

        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLES",
        "abstract": "Songbirds exhibit seasonal plasticity in a broad variety of behavioral and morphological traits associated with reproduction. Changes in song production are well described while changes in song reception are not. In the present study, we test for seasonal variation in auditory processing of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus L.) using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to tone bursts. We measured amplitude and latency of the first ABR peak in spring, summer and autumn at stimulus frequencies from 0.8 to 6.4 kHz and intensity levels from 24 to 80 dB SPL. ABR thresholds were determined at each frequency using cross-correlation. Amplitude was greater in spring than in autumn at frequencies from 3.2 to 6.4 kHz whereas latency and thresholds exhibited no seasonal variation. The results indicate an increase in the number or temporal synchrony of responses from peripheral auditory neurons during the early breeding season. Changes in peripheral auditory processing may enhance temporal coding of the fine structure and envelope of song; thereby, improving assessment of encoded information in both sexes (e.g. individual identity and dominance status) and auditory feedback during song production in males. Peripheral auditory changes may be mediated by reproductive hormones, and could involve changes in hair cell density on the basilar papilla. Our results suggest that peripheral auditory processing of songbirds changes seasonally in parallel with other behavioral and morphological traits, such as song production.",

Our results revealed that, similar to other freshwater teleosts, P. motoro performed hyperosmotic regulation, with very low urea concentrations in plasma and tissues, in freshwater. In 15‰ water, it was non-ureotelic and non-ureoosmotic, acting mainly as an osmoconformer with its plasma osmolality, [Na+] and [Cl−] comparable to those of the external medium. There were significant increases in the content of several free amino acids (FAAs), including glutamate, glutamine and glycine, in muscle and liver, but not in plasma, indicating that FAAs could contribute in part to cell volume regulation. Furthermore, exposure of P. motoro to 15‰ water led to up-regulation of GS activity and protein abundance in both liver and muscle. Thus, our results indicate for the first time that, despite the inability to synthesize urea and the lack of functional carbamoyl phosphate synthetase III (CPS III) which uses glutamine as a substrate, P. motoro retained the capacity to up-regulate the activity and protein expression of GS in response to salinity stress. Potamotrygon motoro was not nitrogen (N) limited when exposed to 15‰ water with feeding, and there were no significant changes in the amination and deamination activities of hepatic glutamate dehydrogenase. In contrast, P. motoro became N limited when exposed to 10‰ water with fasting and could not survive well in 15‰ water without food.",

        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLES",
        "abstract": "While adult zebrafish, Danio rerio, possess ammonia and urea transporters (Rh and UT proteins, respectively) in a number of tissues, they are most heavily concentrated within the gills. UT has a diffuse expression pattern within Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA)-type mitochondrion-rich cells and Rh proteins form a network similar to the arrangement seen in pufferfish gills (Nakada et al., 2007b). Rhag expression appeared to be limited to the pillar cells lining the blood spaces of the lamellae while Rhbg was localized to the outer layer of both the lamellae and the filament, upon the pavement cells. Exposure to high external ammonia (HEA) or phloretin increased tissue levels of ammonia and urea, respectively, in adult and juvenile zebrafish; however, the responses to these stressors were age dependent. HEA increased mRNA levels for a number of Rh proteins in embryos and larvae but did not elicit similar effects in adult gills, which appear to compensate for the unfavourable ammonia excretory gradient by increasing expression of V-type H+-ATPase. Phloretin exposure increased UT mRNA levels in embryos and larvae but was without effect in adult gill tissue. Surprisingly, in both adults and juveniles, HEA increased the mRNA expression of UT and phloretin increased the mRNA expression of Rh proteins. These results imply that, in zebrafish, there may be a tighter link between ammonia and urea excretion than is thought to occur in most teleosts.",

        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLES",
        "abstract": "Intestinal HCO3− secretion is essential to marine teleost fish osmoregulation and comprises a considerable source of base efflux attributable to both serosal HCO3− and endogenous CO2 hydration. The role of intestinal HCO3− secretion in dynamic acid—base balance regulation appears negligible in studies of unfed fish, but evidence of high intestinal fluid [HCO3−] in fed marine teleosts led us to investigate the source of this HCO3− and its potential role in offsetting the postprandial ‘alkaline tide’ commonly associated with digestion. Specifically, we hypothesized that elevated metabolic rate and thus endogenous CO2 production by intestinal tissue as well as increased transepithelial intestinal HCO3− secretion occur post-feeding and offset a postprandial alkaline tide. To test these hypotheses changes in HCO3− secretion and O2 consumption by gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) isolated intestine were quantified 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h post-feeding. Intestinal tissue of unfed fish in general showed high rates of HCO3− secretion (15.5 μmol g−1 h−1) and O2 consumption (8.9 μmol g−1 h−1). Furthermore, postprandial increases in both intestinal HCO3− secretion and O2 consumption (1.6- and 1.9-fold peak increases, respectively) were observed. Elevated intestinal HCO3− secretion rates preceded and outlasted those of O2 consumption, and occurred at a magnitude and duration sufficient to account for the lack of alkaline tide. The dependence of these high rates of postprandial intestinal base secretion on serosal HCO3− indicates transepithelial HCO3− transport increases disproportionately more than endogenous CO2 production. The magnitude of postprandial intestinal HCO3− secretion indicates the intestine certainly is capable of postprandial acid#x02014;base balance regulation.",

The present study examined the hypothesis that, as rates of CO2 production increased during early development in zebrafish (Danio rerio), CA would become necessary for effective CO2 excretion, and that the pattern of CA expression during early development would reflect this transition. Real-time RT-PCR was used to examine the mRNA expression of the two main intracellular CA isoforms over a time course of early development ranging from 0 to 120 h post fertilization (h.p.f.). The mRNA expression of zCAb was generally higher than that of zCAc, particularly during the earliest stages of development. Rates of CO2 excretion increased approximately 15-fold from 24 to 48 h.p.f. whereas rates of O2 uptake increased only 6.7-fold over the same period, indicating a relative stimulation of CO2 excretion over O2 uptake. Treatment of 48 h.p.f. larvae with the CA inhibitor acetazolamide resulted in CO2 excretion rates that were 52% of the value in control larvae, a significant difference that occurred in the absence of any effect on O2 uptake. Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides were used to selectively knock down one or both of the main intracellular CA isoforms. Subsequent measurement of gas transfer rates at 48 h.p.f. indicated that CA knockdown caused a significant relative inhibition of CO2 excretion over O2 uptake, regardless of which cytosolic CA isoform was targeted for knockdown. These results suggest that between 24 h.p.f. and 48 h.p.f., developing zebrafish begin to rely on CA to meet requirements for increased CO2 excretion.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate seasonal changes in the fatty acid composition of (1) pectoralis muscle phospholipids, (2) intramuscular triglyceride stores and (3) adipose tissue triglycerides in free-living white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis). During migratory seasons there was an increase in the n-6:n-3 ratio of muscle membrane phospholipid fatty acids without a change in the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. This change was driven mainly by an increase in the proportion of 18:2n-6 and a decrease in the proportion of 22:6n-3. An increase in the proportion of 18:2n-6 was also observed in the intramuscular and adipose tissue triglyceride stores during the migratory seasons. These increases in 18:2n-6 were offset by a decrease in 16:0; resulting in an elevated proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and elevated double bond index in both fat stores of migrants. The elevated levels of 18:2n-6 in migrant fat stores indicates a high dietary component of this fatty acid, as white-throated sparrows feed mainly on tree seeds and some insects during migration and may not have access to a diet high in n-3 fatty acids. We suspect that elevated dietary levels of 18:2n-6 also caused the observed increases in the proportion of this fatty acid in muscle phospholipids. Overall, we conclude that seasonal changes in adipose and muscle fatty acid composition are likely attributable to diet more than other factors such as migratory exercise or mitochondrial density.",

        "abstract": "We have studied the passive maintenance of high angle of attack and its lift generation during the crane fly's flapping translation using a dynamically scaled model. Since the wing and the surrounding fluid interact with each other, the dynamic similarity between the model flight and actual insect flight was measured using not only the non-dimensional numbers for the fluid (the Reynolds and Strouhal numbers) but also those for the fluid—structure interaction (the mass and Cauchy numbers). A difference was observed between the mass number of the model and that of the actual insect because of the limitation of available solid materials. However, the dynamic similarity during the flapping translation was not much affected by the mass number since the inertial force during the flapping translation is not dominant because of the small acceleration. In our model flight, a high angle of attack of the wing was maintained passively during the flapping translation and the wing generated sufficient lift force to support the insect weight. The mechanism of the maintenance is the equilibrium between the elastic reaction force resulting from the wing torsion and the fluid dynamic pressure. Our model wing rotated quickly at the stroke reversal in spite of the reduced inertial effect of the wing mass compared with that of the actual insect. This result could be explained by the added mass from the surrounding fluid. Our results suggest that the pitching motion can be passive in the crane fly's flapping flight.",

This receptor has also been characterized in some fish species but its function is unknown. We report the molecular and pharmacological characterization, as well as the tissue expression pattern, of sea bass MC5R. Cloning of five active alleles showing different levels of sensitivity to endogenous melanocortin and one non-functional allele demonstrate the allelic complexity of the MC5R locus. The sea bass receptor was activated by all the melanocortins tested, with ACTH and desacetyl-MSH and β-MSH showing the lowest efficiency. The acetylation of the MSH isoforms seems to be critical for the effectiveness of the agonist. Agouti-related protein had no effect on basal or agonist-stimulated activation of the receptor. SbMC5R was mainly expressed in the brain but lower expression levels were found in several peripheral tissues, including liver. Progressive fasting did not induce up- or downregulation of hypothalamic MC5R expression, suggesting that central MC5R is not involved in the regulation of food intake in the sea bass. MTII, a sbMC5R agonist, stimulated hepatic lipolysis in vitro, measured as free fatty acid release into the culture medium after melanocortin agonist exposure of liver fragments, suggesting that MC5R is involved in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism. Taken together, the data suggest that different allelic combinations may confer differential sensitivity to endogenous melanocortin in tissues where MC5R is expressed and, by extension, in hepatic lipid metabolism.",

In both contexts, there is an opportunity for foragers to associate warmth with food rewards. However, honeybee thermal learning is poorly understood. Using an associative learning paradigm (the proboscis extension reflex), we show that honeybees can learn to associate a nectar reward with a heated stimulus applied to the antenna to mimic natural contact with a warm flower or nectar-offering forager. Conditioning with longer inter-trial intervals (ITI) significantly improved learning acquisition. We also trained bees to discriminate between temperatures above (warm) and below (cold) ambient air temperature. Learning acquisition improved by 38% per 10°C increase in absolute stimulus intensity (difference between the rewarded temperature and unrewarded ambient air temperature). However, bees learned positive temperature (warm) significantly better than negative temperature (cold) differences, approximately twice as well for 10°C as compared with a −10°C difference. Thus, thermosensation, a sensory modality that is relatively unexplored in honeybees, could play a role in the acquisition of information from nestmates (social learning) and in foraging decisions influenced by associations between floral temperature and nectar rewards.",

The present study was undertaken to compare the central and peripheral actions of graded doses (25-100 pmol) of trout PACAP and trout VIP on ventilatory and cardiovascular variables in the unanaesthetized rainbow trout. Compared with vehicle, only intracerebroventricular injection of PACAP significantly (P<0.05) elevated the ventilation frequency and the ventilation amplitude, but both peptides significantly increased the total ventilation (<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jexbio/212/23/3919/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>).

When injected centrally, only PACAP produced a significant increase in mean dorsal aortic blood pressure (PDA) (100 pmol: +21%) but neither peptide affected heart rate (fH). Intra-arterial injections of either PACAP or VIP were without effect on the ventilatory variables. PACAP was without significant action on PDA and fH while VIP significantly elevated PDA (100 pmol: +36%) without changing fH. In conclusion, the selective central hyperventilatory actions of exogenously administered trout PACAP, and to a lesser extent VIP, suggest that the endogenous peptides may be implicated in important neuroregulatory functions related to the central control of ventilation in trout.",

The tropical coral reef sponge shows an extremely high proliferation activity, a short cell cycle duration and massive cell shedding. Cell turnover is predominantly confined to a single cell population, i.e. the choanocytes, and in this process apoptosis only plays a minor role. To our knowledge, such fast cell kinetics under steady-state conditions, with high turnover by shedding in the absence of apoptosis, has not been observed previously in any other multicellular organism. The duration of the cell cycle in vivo resembles that of unicellular organisms in culture. Morphological and histochemical studies demonstrate compartmentalization of choanocytes in the sponge tissue, which corresponds well with its remarkable cellular kinetics. Coral reef cavity sponges, like H. caerulea, inhabit low nutrient tropical waters, forcing these organisms to filter large volumes of water and to capture the few nutrients efficiently. Under these oligotrophic conditions, a high cell turnover may be considered as a very useful strategy, preventing permanent damage to the sponge by environmental stress. Halisarca caerulea maintains its body mass and keeps its food uptake system up to date by constantly renewing its filter system. We conclude that studies on cell kinetics and functional morphology provide new and essential information on the growth characteristics and the regulation of sponge growth in vivo as well as in vitro and the role of choanocytes in tissue homeostasis.",

Additionally, eye rotation and head yaw were quantified to determine if species compensate for large blind areas anterior to the head. The winghead shark possessed the largest anterior binocular overlap (48 deg.) and was nearly four times larger than that of the lemon (10 deg.) and blacknose (11 deg.) sharks. The binocular overlap in the scalloped hammerhead sharks (34 deg.) was greater than the bonnethead sharks (13 deg.) and carcharhinid species; however, the bonnethead shark did not differ from the carcharhinids. These results indicate that binocular overlap has increased with lateral head expansion in hammerhead sharks. The hammerhead species did not demonstrate greater eye rotation in the anterior or posterior direction. However, both the scalloped hammerhead and bonnethead sharks exhibited greater head yaw during swimming (16.9 deg. and 15.6 deg., respectively) than the lemon (15.1 deg.) and blacknose (15.0 deg.) sharks, indicating a behavioral compensation for the anterior blind area. This study illustrates the larger binocular overlap in hammerhead species relative to their carcharhinid sister taxa and is consistent with the ‘enhanced binocular field’ hypothesis.",

The optical sensitivities of single cones are similar in both\nbirds (budgerigar 0.27 μm2 sr, Bourke's parrot 0.25μ\nm2 sr) but Bourke's parrots have more (cone to rod ratio,\n1.2:1.0), thinner (2.8 μm) and longer rods (18.5 μm) than budgerigars\n(2.1:1.0, 3.4 μm, 13.3 μm).

The results nicely agree with\nthe activity patterns of the birds, Bourke's parrots being active during the\nday and in twilight while budgerigars are not normally active before sunrise\nand after sunset.

Isolated photophore-filled skin patches produced\nlight under melatonin (MT) and prolactin (PRL) stimulation in a dose-dependent\nmanner but did not react to classical neurotransmitters. Theα\n-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) had an inhibitory effect\non hormonal-induced luminescence. Because luzindole and 4P-PDOT inhibited\nMT-induced luminescence, the action of this hormone is likely to be mediated\nthrough binding to the MT2 receptor subtype, which probably decreases the\nintracellular concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP) because forskolin (a cAMP\ndonor) strongly inhibits the light response to MT. However, PRL seems to\nachieve its effects via janus kinase 2 (JAK2) after binding to its\nreceptor because a specific JAK2 inhibitor inhibits PRL-induced luminescence.\nThe two stimulating hormones showed different kinetics as well as a seasonal\nvariation of light intensity, which was higher in summer (April) than in\nwinter (December and February). All of these results strongly suggest that,\ncontrary to self-luminescent bony fishes, which harbour a nervous control\nmechanism of their photophore luminescence, the light emission is under\nhormonal control in the cartilaginous E. spinax. This clearly\nhighlights the diversity of fish luminescence and confirms its multiple\nindependent apparitions during the course of evolution.",

The purpose of\nthis study was to investigate the relationship between lower limb stiffness\nand peak power production in adolescents (AD) and pre-adolescents (PA). With\ninstitutional approval, two groups of pre-adults (pre-adolescents: 11–13\nyears of age, N=43; adolescents: 16–18 years of age,\nN=30) performed 30 two-legged hops at their preferred frequency and\nthree maximum counter-movement jumps. AD produced significantly greater peak\npower during the counter-movement jump than PA\n(t71=–5.28, P<0.001) even when body mass\nwas accounted for. Lower limb stiffness was significantly correlated with peak\npower production during the counter-movement jump in AD (R=0.62,\nP<0.001) but not in PA (R=0.26, P=0.10). When\nnormalised to body mass, the relationship between lower limb stiffness and\npeak power also differed between the two age groups (R=0.30,\nP=0.11 for AD and R=0.02, P=0.88 for PA). In\naddition, we found that during hopping, both PA and AD behaved like a simple\nspring-mass system. Our findings highlight the importance of lower limb\nstiffness in the context of muscular power production during multi-joint\ntasks.

We\nexamined the nearly symbiont-free (by microscopic observation) filter-feeding\nRed Sea sponge Negombata magnifica in order to: (a) study removal\nefficiency of naturally occurring organic particles, (b) measure the total\namount of absorbed particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON), and\n(c) estimate organic carbon and nitrogen flux in this sponge. Total amount of\norganic carbon and nitrogen in the Gulf of Aqaba was found to be\n48.46±5.69 μg l–1 and 6.45±0.7 μg\nl–1, respectively. While detritus contributed 54% of POC,\nmost PON (84%) came from planktonic microorganisms, mainly prokaryotes.\nParticle removal efficiency ranged from 99% (the cyanobacterium\nSynechococcus sp.) to 37% (for eukaryotic cells >8 μm). On\naverage, N. magnifica ingested 480 μg C day–1\ng–1 (wet mass, WM) sponge and 76.6 μg N\nday–1 g–1 sponge. Ingested POC balanced 85%\nof the sponge's energetic demand but more is needed for biomass production\nbecause it cannot digest all of the carbon. 54.4±16.1 μg N\nday–1 g–1 (WM) nitrogen was excreted as\ntotal ammonia nitrogen (TAN); however, nitrogen allowance should be higher\nbecause more nitrogen is deposited for sponge biomass during growth. It is\nhypothesized that the discrepancy in the nutritional requirements should be\ncovered by the sponge absorbing carbon and nitrogen from sources that are not\ndealt with in the present research, such as dissolved organic carbon and\nnitrogen. This study highlights the significance of detritus as a carbon\nsource, and prokaryotes as a PON source in sponge feeding.",

With decreasing air density drag is reduced and lift per\nwingbeat decreases. According to flight mechanical theory, wingbeat frequency\nand air speed should increase with decreasing air density, i.e. increasing\nflight altitude. Although wind tunnel experiments have shed light on many\naspects of avian flight, the effect of air density remained ambiguous, because\nair density could not be adjusted in wind tunnels, until now. By means of\nradar we recorded tracks of several thousand free-flying individual birds\nduring nocturnal migration. From these tracks we derived wingbeat frequencies\nand air speeds covering air densities from 0.84 kg m–3 to\n1.13 kg m–3, corresponding to an altitudinal range of about\n3000 m. We demonstrate here with this sample of nocturnal migrants that: (1)\nwingbeat frequency decreases with air density (which corresponds to an\nincrease in flap-gliding flyers by 0.4 Hz km–1 and in\nbounding flyers by 1.1 Hz km–1), (2) reducing wingbeat\nfrequency to equivalent sea level values did not abolish the dependency on air\ndensity, as expected by flight mechanical theory, and (3) bounding flyers show\na higher response in their flight behavioural adjustments to changes in air\ndensity than flap-gliding flyers. With respect to air speed flap-gliding\nflyers increase their air speed by 1.0 m s–1\nkm–1 and bounding flyers by 1.4 m s–1\nkm–1.",

Larval\ndiapause in the final instar is induced under short-day conditions whereas\npupation occurs without diapause under long-day conditions. Adult reproductive\ndiapause is terminated under short-day conditions but maintained under\nlong-day conditions. The stemmata of the larvae and compound eyes of the\nadults were removed and the responses of the animals to photoperiod were\ncompared to those of intact beetles. When all the stemmata were removed,\nlarvae pupated without entering diapause under both long-day and short-day\nconditions, indicating that the larvae lacking stemmata were incapable of\nphotoreception for photoperiodism. As in other holometabolous insects, the\nstemmata migrated into the brain during metamorphosis and remained\nrudimentarily in the optic lobe of the adult brain. However, these\nstemmata-derived organs were found to be no longer necessary for\nphotoperiodism, because adults lacking the stemmata-derived organs responded\nto photoperiod normally. By contrast, removal of the compound eyes in adults\nresulted in the termination of reproductive diapause under both long-day and\nshort-day conditions, indicating that photoreception for photoperiodism in the\nadult stage is performed by the compound eyes. Therefore, the site of\nphotoperiodic photoreception in L. kumagaii appear to change from the\nstemmata to the compound eyes during metamorphosis.",

Using microscanning laser Doppler\nvibrometry to measure the vibrational characteristics of this novel tympanum,\nthe membrane was found to vibrate in two distinct modes, depending on the\nfrequency range: at lower frequencies (1–5 kHz) the vibration was\nfocused at the proximal half of the posterior side of the outer membrane,\nwhile at higher frequencies (5–20 kHz) the entire membrane contributed\nto the vibration. The maximum deflection points of the two vibrational modes\ncorrespond to the locations of the associated chordotonal organs, suggesting\nthat M. peleides has the capacity for frequency partitioning because\nof the different vibrational properties of the two membrane components.\nExtracellular nerve recordings confirm that the innervating chordotonal organs\nrespond to the same frequency range of 1–20 kHz, and are most sensitive\nbetween 2 and 4 kHz, although distinct frequency discrimination was not\nobserved.

Most of the first cycle of sound occurred during swimbladder\ncompression, indicating that the bladder rapidly contracted and expanded as\nforce increased during the strike. Harder hits were shorter in duration and\ngenerated a 30 dB increase in amplitude for a 5-fold or 14 dB range in\ndisplacement. For an equivalent strike dominant frequency, damping, bladder\ndisplacement and sound amplitude did not change with fish size, i.e. equal\ninput generated equal output. The frequency spectrum was broad, and dominant\nfrequency was driven by the strike and not the natural frequency of the\nbladder. Bladder displacement decayed rapidly (ζ averaged 0.33,\nequivalent to an automobile shock absorber), and the bladder had a low\nQ (sharpness of tuning), averaging 1.8. Sound output of an acoustic\nsource is determined by volume velocity (surface area × velocity), and\nbladder surface area, muscle dimensions and contraction amplitude increase\nwith fish size.

Hatchlings are limited to\nthe tropics and near-surface water. Adults, obligate predators on gelatinous\nplankton, encounter cold water at depth (<1280 m) or high latitude and are\ngigantotherms that maintain elevated core body temperatures in cold water.\nThis study shows that there are great ontogenetic changes in tracheal\nstructure related to diving and exposure to cold.

Consequently, factors that limit SusEI are of interest. The `heat\ndissipation limitation hypothesis' suggests that maximum SusEI during\nlactation is limited by the capacity to dissipate body heat generated as a\nby-product of processing food and producing milk. In the present study, we\ntested the heat dissipation limitation hypothesis in lactating Brandt's voles\n(Lasiopodomys brandtii). Female voles were mated and pregnant at\n21(±1)°C. A random sample of animals was transferred into a hot\nroom 30(±1)°C on the day of parturition. The energy intake of\nlactating voles at 30°C was always lower than that at 21°C.

As for reproductive\nperformance, there was a difference in the response to the higher temperature\nbetween mothers raising large and those raising small litters. For small\nlitters (<7) there was no significant change in litter mass, but for large\nlitters (<7) there was a significant decrease at the higher temperature. On\naverage, in larger litters the pups were 15.5 g heavier on day 12 of lactation\nwhen raised at 21°C. Our data from Brandt's voles support the suggestion\nthat SusEI at peak lactation is limited by heat dissipation capacity,\nparticularly for those voles raising large litters. In smaller litters the\nperipheral limitation hypothesis may be more relevant. The importance of heat\ndissipation limits in species raising exclusively small litters needs to be\ninvestigated.",

The eyes of\nC. plumbeus are optimised for vision under variable light conditions, which\nchange during development as the animal probes new light environments in its\nsearch for food and mates. By contrast, the eyes of S. mitsukurii are\nspecifically adapted to enhance retinal illumination within a dim light\nenvironment, and the detection of bioluminescent prey may be optimised with\nthe use of lenticular short-wavelength-absorbing filters. Our findings suggest\nthat the light environment strongly influences optical features in this class\nof vertebrates and that optical properties of the eye may be useful predictors\nof habitat and behaviour for lesser-known species of this vertebrate\ngroup.",

We did not find\nany effects of methionine on nestling immunity (i.e. lymphocyte counts,\nnatural antibody levels or complement-mediated immunity).

This remarkable phenomenon\npoints very clearly at one of two existing alternative magnetoreception\nmechanisms in terrestrial animals, i.e. the mechanism based on the radical\npair reactions of specific photosensitive molecules. As the first such study\nin invertebrates, our work offers evidence that geomagnetic field reception in\nAmerican cockroach is sensitive to a weak radio frequency field. Furthermore,\nwe show that the `deafening' effect at Larmor frequency 1.2 MHz is stronger\nthan at different frequencies. The parameter studied was the rise in locomotor\nactivity of cockroaches induced by periodic changes in the geomagnetic North\npositions by 60 deg. The onset of the disruptive effect of a 1.2 MHz field was\nfound between 12 nT and 18 nT whereas the threshold of a doubled frequency\nfield 2.4 MHz fell between 18 nT and 44 nT. A 7 MHz field showed no impact\neven in maximal 44 nT magnetic flux density.

As a first step, we hypothesized whole limb\nkinematics were of primary importance and would be preferentially conserved\nover individual joint kinematics after neuromuscular injury. We used a\nwell-established peripheral nerve injury model of cat ankle extensor muscles\nto generate two experimental injury groups with a predictable time course of\ntemporary paralysis followed by complete muscle self-reinnervation. Mean\ntrajectories of individual joint kinematics were altered as a result of\ndeficits after injury. By contrast, mean trajectories of limb orientation and\nlimb length remained largely invariant across all animals, even with paralyzed\nankle extensor muscles, suggesting changes in mean joint angles were\ncoordinated as part of a long-term compensation strategy to minimize change in\nwhole limb kinematics. Furthermore, at each measurement stage (pre-injury,\nparalytic and self-reinnervated) step-by-step variance of individual joint\nkinematics was always significantly greater than that of limb orientation. Our\nresults suggest joint angle combinations are coordinated and selected to\nstabilize whole limb kinematics against short-term natural step-by-step\ndeviations as well as long-term, pathological deviations created by injury.\nThis may represent a fundamental compensation principle allowing animals to\nadapt to changing conditions with minimal effect on overall locomotor\nfunction.",

However, compared with typical fish,\nsyngnathid fishes have a remarkably different morphology (elongated snout,\nsmall hyoid, immobile pectoral girdle) and feeding strategy (pivot feeding:\nbringing the small mouth rapidly close to the prey by neurocranial\ndorsorotation). As a result, it is unclear how suction is generated in\nSyngnathidae. In this study, lateral and ventral expansions of the head were\nquantified in Hippocampus reidi and linked to the kinematics of the\nmouth, hyoid and neurocranium. In addition, the flow velocities inside the\nbucco-pharyngeal cavity and in front of the mouth were calculated. Our data\nsuggest that the volume changes caused by lateral expansion are dominant over\nventral expansion. Maximum gape, neurocranium rotation and hyoid depression\nare all reached before actual volume increase and before visible prey\nmovement. This implies that, unlike previously studied teleosts, hyoid\nrotation does not contribute to ventral expansion by lowering the floor of the\nmouth during prey capture in H. reidi. The lateral volume changes\nshow a rostro-caudal expansion, but the maximal flow velocity is not near the\nmouth aperture (as has been demonstrated for example in catfish) but at the\nnarrow region of the buccal cavity, dorsal to the hyoid.",

Analysing this relationship\nwill require an experimental system that allows for the synchronous\nmeasurement of visual cues and visually guided behaviour. The first step in\nquantifying visual cues from an animal's perspective is to understand the\nfilter properties of its visual system. We examined the first stage of visual\nprocessing – sampling by the ommatidial array – in the compound\neye of the fiddler crab Uca vomeris. Using an in vivo\npseudopupil method we determined sizes and viewing directions of ommatidia and\ncreated a complete eye map of optical and sampling resolution across the\nvisual field. Our results reveal five distinct eye regions (ventral, dorsal,\nfrontal, lateral and medial) which exhibit clear differences in the\norganisation of the local sampling array, in particular with respect to the\nbalance of resolution and contrast sensitivity. We argue that, under global\neye space constraints, these regional optimisations reflect the information\ncontent and behavioural relevance of the corresponding parts of the visual\nfield. In demonstrating the tight link between visual sampling, visual cues\nand behavioural strategies, our analysis highlights how the study of natural\nbehaviour and natural stimuli is essential to our understanding and\ninterpretation of the evolution and ecology of animal behaviour and the design\nof sensory systems.",

A R–L shunt is a\nbypass of the pulmonary circulation and recirculation of oxygen-poor blood\nback to the systemic circulation and has often been observed during the\nfrequent apnoeic periods of non-avian reptiles, particularly during diving in\naquatic species. We eliminated R–L shunt in American alligators\n(Alligator mississippiensis) by surgically occluding the left aorta\n(LAo; arising from right ventricle) upstream and downstream of the foramen of\nPanizza (FoP), and we tested the hypotheses that this removal of R–L\nshunt would cause afterload-induced cardiac remodelling and adversely affect\ndiving performance.

In a separate group of recovered, surgically altered\nalligators allowed to dive freely in a dive chamber at 23°C, occlusion of\nthe LAo did not alter oxygen consumption or voluntary apnoeic periods relative\nto sham animals. While surgical removal of R–L shunt causes considerable\nchanges in cardiac morphology similar to aortic banding in mammals, its\nremoval does not affect the respiratory pattern or metabolism of alligators.\nIt appears probable that the low metabolic rate of reptiles, rather than\npulmonary circulatory bypass, allows for normal aerobic dives.",

Mass-specific metabolic enzyme activity confirmed that\nglycolytic capacity scaled positively in deep white muscle (regression slope,\nb=0.1 to 0.8) over a body mass range of ∼20–1500 g, but\nonly creatine phosphokinase showed positive scaling in lateral red muscle\n(b=0.5). Although oxidative enzymes showed negative allometry in red\nmuscle (b=–0.01 to –0.02), mass-specific myoglobin\ncontent scaled positively (b=0.7). Capillary to fibre ratio of red\nmuscle was higher in larger (1.42±0.15) than smaller (1.20±0.15)\nfish, suggesting progressive angiogenesis.

Visual guidance to\nthe nest is simplified by the insects' tendency to adopt similar viewing\ndirections during learning and return flights. To understand better the\nfactors determining the particular viewing directions that insects choose, we\nhave recorded the learning and return flights of a ground-nesting bumblebee in\ntwo visual environments – an enclosed garden with a partly open view\nbetween north and west, and a flat roof with a more open panorama. In both\nplaces, bees left and returned to an inconspicuous nest hole in the centre of\na tabletop, with the hole marked by one or more nearby cylinders. In all\nexperiments, bees adopted similar preferred orientations on their learning and\nreturn flights. Bees faced predominantly either north or south, suggesting the\nexistence of two attractors. The bees' selection between attractors seems to\nbe influenced both by the distribution of light, as determined by the shape of\nthe skyline, and by the direction of wind. In the partly enclosed garden with\nlittle or no wind, bees tended to face north throughout the day, i.e. towards\nthe pole in the brighter half of their surroundings. When white curtains,\nwhich distributed skylight more evenly, were placed around the table, bees\nfaced both north and south. The bees on the roof tended to face south or north\nwhen the wind came from a wide arc of directions from the south or north,\nrespectively. We suggest that bees switch facing orientation between north and\nsouth as a compromise between maintaining a single viewing direction for\nefficient view-based navigation and responding to the distribution of light\nfor the easier detection of landmarks seen against the ground or to the\ndirection of the wind for exploiting olfactory cues.",

        "abstract": "Enzymes and biochemical mechanisms essential to survival are under extreme\nselective pressure and are highly conserved through evolutionary time. We\napplied this evolutionary concept to barnacle cement polymerization, a process\ncritical to barnacle fitness that involves aggregation and cross-linking of\nproteins. The biochemical mechanisms of cement polymerization remain largely\nunknown. We hypothesized that this process is biochemically similar to blood\nclotting, a critical physiological response that is also based on aggregation\nand cross-linking of proteins. Like key elements of vertebrate and\ninvertebrate blood clotting, barnacle cement polymerization was shown to\ninvolve proteolytic activation of enzymes and structural precursors,\ntransglutaminase cross-linking and assembly of fibrous proteins. Proteolytic\nactivation of structural proteins maximizes the potential for bonding\ninteractions with other proteins and with the surface. Transglutaminase\ncross-linking reinforces cement integrity. Remarkably, epitopes and sequences\nhomologous to bovine trypsin and human transglutaminase were identified in\nbarnacle cement with tandem mass spectrometry and/or western blotting. Akin to\nblood clotting, the peptides generated during proteolytic activation\nfunctioned as signal molecules, linking a molecular level event (protein\naggregation) to a behavioral response (barnacle larval settlement). Our\nresults draw attention to a highly conserved protein polymerization mechanism\nand shed light on a long-standing biochemical puzzle. We suggest that barnacle\ncement polymerization is a specialized form of wound healing. The\npolymerization mechanism common between barnacle cement and blood may be a\ntheme for many marine animal glues.",

Monoarticular muscles are argued to perform work at a\njoint, whereas biarticular muscles are argued to transfer energy while\nresisting moments across adjacent joints. To test these predictions, in\nvivo patterns of muscle activation, strain, and strain rate were compared\nusing electromyography and sonomicrometry in two major elbow extensors, the\nlong and lateral heads of the triceps brachii of goats (Capra\nhircus), across a range of speed (1–5 m s–1) and\ngait. Muscle recordings were synchronized to limb kinematics using high-speed\ndigital video imaging (250 Hz). Measurements obtained from four goats\n(25–45 kg) showed that the monoarticular lateral head exhibited a\nstretch-shortening pattern (6.8±0.6% stretch and–\n10.6±2.7% shortening; mean ± s.e.m. for all speeds and\ngaits) after being activated, which parallels the flexion–extension\npattern of the elbow. By contrast, the biarticular long head shortened through\nmost of stance (–16.4±3.4%), despite elbow flexion in the first\nhalf and shoulder extension in the last half of stance. The magnitude of elbow\nflexion and shoulder extension increased with increasing speed (ANCOVA,\nP<0.05 and P<0.001), as did the magnitude and rate of\nactive stretch of fascicles in the lateral head (P<0.001 for\nboth). In all individuals, shortening fascicle strain rates increased with\nspeed in the long head (P<0.001), and, in three of the four\nindividuals, strain magnitude increased. Few independent effects of gait were\nfound. In contrast to its expected function, the biarticular long head appears\nto produce positive work throughout stance, whereas the monoarticular lateral\nhead appears to absorb work at the elbow. The biarticular anatomy of the long\nhead may mitigate increases in muscle strain with speed in this muscle,\nbecause strain magnitude in the second phase of stance (when the shoulder\nextends) decreased with speed (P<0.05).",

To gain a further\nunderstanding of mechanisms underlying sensory integration in odour-guided\nbehaviour, our study examined the effects of visual stimuli induced by\nself-motion and object-motion on odour-guided flight in male M.\nsexta. By placing stationary objects (pillars) on either side of a female\npheromone plume, moths produced self-induced visual motion during odour-guided\nflight.

Modifications of odour-guided flight behaviour\nin the presence of stationary objects suggest that visual information, in\nconjunction with olfactory cues, can be used to control the rate of\ncounter-turning. We suggest that the behavioural responses to visual stimuli\ninduced by object-motion indicate the presence of a neural circuit that relays\nvisual information to initiate escape responses.

Only later do\ntracheae fill with gas and come to support high rates of gas flux. This\nliquid-to-gas transition is poorly understood. Using eggs of the sphingid moth\nManduca sexta, we show that longitudinal tracheae in embryos fill\nwith gas in less than 5 s, without invasion of external air, by a process of\ncavitation. Cavitation requires that tracheal liquids be under tension, and we\npropose two complementary processes for generating it. One likely, classical\nmechanism is tracheolar fluid absorption, first proposed by Wigglesworth. Our\ndata support this mechanism in Manduca: after cavitation, liquids are\nprogressively drawn out of finer tracheal branches. The second, previously\nunknown, mechanism is evaporative water loss across the eggshell, which leads\nboth to declining egg volume and to a larger negative pressure potential of\nwater. The pressure potential helps to drive rapid expansion of small bubbles\nnucleated near spiracles. Once bubbles are large enough to have displaced\nliquid across the diameter of a trachea, negative capillary pressure\nreinforces subsequent expansion of the bubble. Together with predictions from\nmodern cavitation theory, our observations substantiate Wigglesworth's\ncontention that gas filling is promoted by increasing hydrophobicity\nassociated with tanning of the spiracles and major tracheal branches.",

        "abstract": "When an insect hovers, the centre of mass of its body oscillates around a\npoint in the air and its body angle oscillates around a mean value, because of\nthe periodically varying aerodynamic and inertial forces of the flapping\nwings. In the present paper, hover flight including body oscillations is\nsimulated by coupling the equations of motion with the Navier–Stokes\nequations. The equations are solved numerically; periodical solutions\nrepresenting the hover flight are obtained by the shooting method. Two model\ninsects are considered, a dronefly and a hawkmoth; the former has relatively\nhigh wingbeat frequency (n) and small wing mass to body mass ratio,\nwhilst the latter has relatively low wingbeat frequency and large wing mass to\nbody mass ratio. The main results are as follows. (i) The body mainly has a\nhorizontal oscillation; oscillation in the vertical direction is about 1/6 of\nthat in the horizontal direction and oscillation in pitch angle is relatively\nsmall. (ii) For the hawkmoth, the peak-to-peak values of the horizontal\nvelocity, displacement and pitch angle are 0.11U (U is the\nmean velocity at the radius of gyration of the wing), 0.22c=4 mm\n(c is the mean chord length) and 4 deg., respectively. For the\ndronefly, the corresponding values are 0.02U, 0.05c=0.15 mm\nand 0.3 deg., much smaller than those of the hawkmoth. (iii) The horizontal\nmotion of the body decreases the relative velocity of the wings by a small\namount. As a result, a larger angle of attack of the wing, and hence a larger\ndrag to lift ratio or larger aerodynamic power, is required for hovering,\ncompared with the case of neglecting body oscillations. For the hawkmoth, the\nangle of attack is about 3.5 deg. larger and the specific power about 9%\nlarger than that in the case of neglecting the body oscillations; for the\ndronefly, the corresponding values are 0.7 deg. and 2%. (iv) The horizontal\noscillation of the body consists of two parts; one (due to wing aerodynamic\nforce) is proportional to 1/cn2 and the other (due to wing\ninertial force) is proportional to wing mass to body mass ratio. For many\ninsects, the values of 1/cn2 and wing mass to body mass\nratio are much smaller than those of the hawkmoth, and the effects of body\noscillation would be rather small; thus it is reasonable to neglect the body\noscillations in studying their aerodynamics.",

        "authors": "Laura K. Jordan, Stephen M. Kajiura, Malcolm S. Gordon",
        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLE",
        "abstract": "Elasmobranch fishes (sharks, skates and rays) possess highly sensitive\nelectrosensory systems, which enable them to detect weak electric fields such\nas those produced by potential prey organisms. Different species have unique\nelectrosensory pore numbers, densities and distributions. Functional\ndifferences in detection capabilities resulting from these structural\ndifferences are largely unknown. Stingrays and other batoid fishes have eyes\npositioned on the opposite side of the body from the mouth. Furthermore, they\noften feed on buried prey, which can be located non-visually using the\nelectrosensory system. In the present study we test functional predictions\nbased on structural differences in three stingray species (Urobatis\nhalleri, Pteroplatytrygon violacea and Myliobatis californica)\nwith differing electrosensory system morphology. We compare detection\ncapabilities based upon behavioral responses to dipole electric signals\n(5.3–9.6 μA). Species with greater ventral pore numbers and densities\nwere predicted to demonstrate enhanced electrosensory capabilities. Electric\nfield intensities at orientation were similar among these species, although\nthey differed in response type and orientation pathway. Minimum voltage\ngradients eliciting feeding responses were well below 1\nnVcm–1 for all species regardless of pore number and\ndensity.",

        "title": "The role of experience in flight behaviour of Drosophila",
        "authors": "Thomas Hesselberg, Fritz-Olaf Lehmann",
        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLE",
        "abstract": "Experience plays a key role in the acquisition of complex motor skills in\nrunning and flight of many vertebrates. To evaluate the significance of\nprevious experience for the efficiency of motor behaviour in an insect, we\ninvestigated the flight behaviour of the fruit fly Drosophila. We\nreared flies in chambers in which the animals could freely walk and extend\ntheir wings, but could not gain any flight experience. These naive animals\nwere compared with control flies under both open- and closed-loop tethered\nflight conditions in a flight simulator as well as in a free-flight arena. The\ndata suggest that the overall flight behaviour in Drosophila seems to\nbe predetermined because both groups exhibited similar mean stroke amplitude\nand stroke frequency, similar open-loop responses to visual stimulation and\nthe immediate ability to track visual objects under closed-loop feedback\nconditions. In short free flight bouts, peak saccadic turning rate, angular\nacceleration, peak horizontal speed and flight altitude were also similar in\nnaive and control flies. However, we found significant changes in other key\nparameters in naive animals such as a reduction in mean horizontal speed\n(–23%) and subtle changes in mean turning rate (–48%). Naive flies\nproduced 25% less yaw torque-equivalent stroke amplitudes than the controls in\nresponse to a visual stripe rotating in open loop around the tethered animal,\npotentially suggesting a flight-dependent adaptation of the visuo-motor gain\nin the control group. This change ceased after the animals experienced visual\nclosed-loop feedback. During closed-loop flight conditions, naive flies had\n53% larger differences in left and right stroke amplitude when fixating a\nvisual object, thus steering control was less precise. We discuss two\nalternative hypotheses to explain our results: the `neuronal experience'\nhypothesis, suggesting that there are some elements of learning and\nfine-tuning involved during the first flight experiences in\nDrosophila and the `muscular exercise' hypothesis. Our experiments\nsupport the first hypothesis because maximum locomotor capacity seems not to\nbe significantly impaired in the naive group. Although this study primarily\nconfirms the genetic pre-disposition for flight in Drosophila,\nprevious experience may apparently adjust locomotor fine control and aerial\nperformance, although this effect seems to be small compared with\nvertebrates.",

        "authors": "Bernt Rønning, Anne S. Mortensen, Børge Moe, Olivier Chastel, Augustine Arukwe, Claus Bech",
        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLE",
        "abstract": "Young birds, in their post-natal growth period, may reduce their growth and\nmetabolism when facing a food shortage. To examine how such responses can be\nmediated by endocrine-related factors, we exposed Japanese quail chicks to\nfood restriction for either 2 days (age 6–8 days) or 5 days (age\n6–11 days). We then measured growth and resting metabolic rate (RMR),\nand circulating 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) and\n3,5,3′,5′-tetraiodothyronine (T4) levels as well as expression\npatterns of genes involved in growth (insulin-like growth factor-I: IGF-I) and\nthyroid hormone signalling (thyroid-stimulating hormone-β: TSHβ,\ntype II iodothyronine deiodinase: D2, thyroid hormone receptors isoforms:\nTRα and TRβ). The food-restricted chicks receiving a\nweight-maintenance diet showed reductions in structural growth and RMR. Plasma\nlevels of both T3 and T4 were reduced in the food-restricted birds, and within\nthe 5 days food-restricted group there was a positive correlation between RMR\nand T3. IGF-I mRNA showed significantly higher abundance in the liver of\nad libitum fed birds at day 8 compared with food-restricted birds. In\nthe brain, TSHβ mRNA level tended to be lower in food-restricted quails\non day 8 compared with controls. Furthermore, TRα expression was lower\nin the brain of food-restricted birds at day 8 compared with birds fed ad\nlibitum. Interestingly, brain D2 mRNA was negatively correlated with\nplasma T3 levels, tending to increase with the length of food restriction.\nOverall, our results show that food restriction produced significant effects\non circulating thyroid hormones and differentially affected mRNA species in\nthe thyroid hormone signalling pathway. Thus, we conclude that the effects of\nfood restriction observed on growth and metabolism were partly mediated by\nchanges in the endocrine-related factors investigated.",

        "authors": "Erik Sperfeld, Alexander Wacker",
        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLE",
        "abstract": "Enhanced water temperatures promote the occurrence of cyanobacterial\nblooms, which may be detrimental to aquatic herbivores. Especially, the\noften-dominant crustaceans could be negatively affected because cyanobacteria\nare deficient in phytosterols, which are required by the crustaceans to form\nthe membrane component cholesterol, which in turn plays a role in thermal\nadaptation. Here, we determined the influence of temperature on growth,\nreproduction and the allocation of dietary sterol into somatic tissues and\neggs of the keystone species Daphnia magna raised along a dietary\ncholesterol gradient. Mass-specific growth rates of D. magna\nincreased with the increasing availability of dietary cholesterol up to an\nincipient limiting level, which increased with increasing temperature. This\nindicates a higher demand for cholesterol for growth at higher temperatures\nand may explain the consistently smaller clutch sizes of reproducing females\nat the highest temperature. The cholesterol content of the individuals\nincreased with increasing dietary cholesterol; this increase was enhanced at\nhigher temperatures, indicating a higher demand for cholesterol for tissues\nand probably specifically for membranes. Surprisingly, the daphnids showed\ndifferent allocation strategies with regard to temperature and dietary sterol\navailability. The cholesterol content of eggs was enhanced at higher\ntemperature, which suggested that females allocate more cholesterol to their\noffspring, presumably to ensure sufficient egg development. When dietary\ncholesterol was limiting, however, females did not allocate more cholesterol\nto their eggs. Our data suggest that during cyanobacterial blooms, a potential\ndietary sterol limitation of Daphnia can be intensified at higher\nwater temperatures, which can occur with global warming.",

        "authors": "Michał S. Wojciechowski, Berry Pinshow",
        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLE",
        "abstract": "For small endothermic animals, heterothermy serves as an energy-saving\nmechanism for survival in challenging environments, but it may also accelerate\nfat accumulation in individuals preparing for fuel-demanding activities. This\nis the first study to demonstrate adaptive hypothermic responses in migrating\npasserines. While monitoring body temperature (Tb) of\neight blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) by radiotelemetry, we found that\nduring daytime Tb=42.5±0.4°C (mean ±\ns.d.); at night Tb decreased to a minimum between 33 and\n40°C. We determined the lower limit for normothermy at 37.4°C and\nfound that on 12 out of 34 bird-nights of observations under semi-natural\nconditions blackcaps reduced their Tb below normothermic\nresting levels with minimum values of 33 and 34.5°C compared with\nrest-phase normothermic Tb of 38.8±0.8°C. In\nbirds of body mass (mb) <16.3 g, minimum\nTb at night correlated with the individual's\nmb (r=0.67, P<0.01, N=17),\nbut this was not the case in birds with mb>16.3 g.\nMinimum nocturnal Tb did not correlate with night-time air\ntemperature (Ta). Measurements of metabolic rate in birds\nsubjected to a Ta of 15°C showed that hypothermia of\nthis magnitude can lead to a reduction of some 30% in energy expenditure\ncompared with birds remaining normothermic. Our data suggest that by reducing\nthe Tb–Ta gradient, blackcaps\naccelerate their rate of fuel accumulation at a stopover. When body energy\nreserves are low blackcaps may achieve this reduction by entering hypothermia.\nSince hypothermia, as seen in blackcaps, may lead to significant energy\nsavings and facilitate body mass gain, we predict that it is common among\nsmall migrating passerines.",

        "authors": "Lidia Eva Wysocki, Karen Montey, Arthur N. Popper",
        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLE",
        "abstract": "Being ectothermic, fish body temperature generally depends on ambient water\ntemperature. Thus, ambient temperature might affect various sensory systems,\nincluding hearing, as a result of metabolic and physiological processes.\nHowever, the maintenance of sensory functions in a changing environment may be\ncrucial for an animal's survival. Many fish species rely on hearing for\nacoustic orientation and communication. In order to investigate the influence\nof temperature on the auditory system, channel catfish Ictalurus\npunctatus was chosen as a model for a eurytherm species and the tropical\ncatfish Pimelodus pictus as a model for a stenotherm fish. Hearing\nsensitivity was measured with animals acclimated or unacclimated to different\nwater temperatures. Ambient water temperature significantly influenced hearing\nthresholds and the shape of auditory evoked potentials, especially at higher\nfrequencies in I. punctatus. Hearing sensitivity of I.\npunctatus was lowest at 10°C and increased by up to 36 dB between\n10°C and 26°C. Significant differences were also revealed between\nacclimated and unacclimated animals after an increase in water temperature but\nnot a decrease. By contrast, differences in hearing thresholds were smaller in\nP. pictus, even if a similar temperature difference (8°C) was\nconsidered. However, P. pictus showed a similar trend as I.\npunctatus in exhibiting higher hearing sensitivity at the highest tested\ntemperature, especially at the highest frequency tested. The results therefore\nsuggest that the functional temperature dependence of sensory systems may\ndiffer depending upon whether a species is physiologically adapted to tolerate\na wide or narrow temperature range.",

        "title": "Flexible clap and fling in tiny insect flight",
        "authors": "Laura A. Miller, Charles S. Peskin",
        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLE",
        "abstract": "Of the insects that have been filmed in flight, those that are 1 mm in\nlength or less often clap their wings together at the end of each upstroke and\nfling them apart at the beginning of each downstroke. This `clap and fling'\nmotion is thought to augment the lift forces generated during flight. What has\nnot been highlighted in previous work is that very large forces are required\nto clap the wings together and to fling the wings apart at the low Reynolds\nnumbers relevant to these tiny insects. In this paper, we use the immersed\nboundary method to simulate clap and fling in rigid and flexible wings. We\nfind that the drag forces generated during fling with rigid wings can be up to\n10 times larger than what would be produced without the effects of\nwing–wing interaction. As the horizontal components of the forces\ngenerated during the end of the upstroke and beginning of the downstroke\ncancel as a result of the motion of the two wings, these forces cannot be used\nto generate thrust. As a result, clap and fling appears to be rather\ninefficient for the smallest flying insects. We also add flexibility to the\nwings and find that the maximum drag force generated during the fling can be\nreduced by about 50%. In some instances, the net lift forces generated are\nalso improved relative to the rigid wing case.",
