        "abstract": "Water birds whose young begin swimming while downy are interesting because\nhypothermia and mortality are associated with wetting. While wetting is known\nto increase heat loss, little is known about basic issues, such as the amount\nof heat lost to air vs water during surface swimming. To partition\nheat loss to air and water, we measured the body temperature, metabolism and\nthermal conductance of 2–3-day-old mallard ducklings (Anas\nplatyrhynchos) swimming under different combinations of air and water\ntemperature. Ventral down remained dry or was wetted only on the surface, and\nmost ducklings could maintain Tb>39°C for 1 h while\nswimming on water as cold as 5°C. Ducklings were at or below thermal\nneutrality when swimming in water at Tw=30°C even when\nair temperature Ta=45°C. Heat loss from ducklings with\ndry down to air and water was partitioned by fitting data to a heat transfer\nmodel of the form\nM=G(Tb–Tw)+Ke(Tb–Ta).\nFor an average 48 g duckling, thermal conductance to water increased with\nwater temperature,\nG=0.0470(1+1.059×10–6Tw4)W/°C-animal.\nConductance to air was Ke=0.0196 W/°C-animal for all\nair temperatures. Thus, a minimum of 70% of metabolic heat production is lost\nto water, and this fraction increases with increasing temperature.",

        "abstract": "Polymesoda expansa spends a considerable portion of its life\nexposed to air in mangrove swamps where salinity fluctuates greatly. Thus, the\naim of this study was to evaluate the effects of aerial exposure (transfer\nfrom 10‰ brackish water directly to air) or salinity changes (transfer\nfrom 10‰ brackish water directly to 30‰ seawater) on nitrogen\nmetabolism in P. expansa. We concluded that P. expansa is\nnon-ureogenic because carbamoyl phosphate (CPS) III activity was undetectable\nin the adductor muscle, foot muscle, hepatopancreas and mantle when exposed to\nbrackish water (control), seawater or air for 17 days. It is ammonotelic as it\nexcretes nitrogenous wastes mainly as ammonia in brackish water or seawater.\nAfter transfer to seawater for 17 days, the contents of total free amino acids\n(TFAA) in the adductor muscle, foot muscle, hepatopancreas and mantle\nincreased significantly. This could be related to an increase in protein\ndegradation because exposure to seawater led to a greater rate of ammonia\nexcretion on days 15 and 17, despite unchanged tissue ammonia contents.\nAlanine was the major free amino acid (FAA) in P. expansa. The\ncontribution of alanine to the TFAA pool in various tissues increased from\n43–48% in brackish water to 62–73% in seawater. In contrast, in\nclams exposed to air for 17 days there were no changes in alanine content in\nany of the tissues studied. Thus, the functional role of alanine in P.\nexpansa is mainly connected with intracellular osmoregulation. Although\n8.5–16.1% of the TFAA pool of P. expansa was attributable to\nglutamine, the glutamine contents in the adductor muscle, foot muscle,\nhepatopancreas and mantle were unaffected by 17 days of exposure to seawater.\nHowever, after exposure to air for 17 days, there were significant increases\nin ammonia content in all these tissues in P. expansa, accompanied by\nsignificant increases in glutamine content (2.9-, 2.5-, 4.5- and 3.4-fold,\nrespectively). Simultaneously, there were significant increases in glutamine\nsynthetase activities in the adductor muscle (1.56-fold) and hepatopancreas\n(3.8-fold). This is the first report on the accumulation of glutamine\nassociated with an upregulation of glutamine synthetase in a bivalve species\nin response to aerial exposure, and these results reveal that the evolution of\nglutamine synthesis as a means for detoxification of ammonia first occurred\namong invertebrates.",

However, despite\ntheir crucial role in the structure of marine communities, their importance\nboth to commercial and to recreational fisheries, and the inherent interest in\ntheir role in vertebrate evolution, very little is known about their visual\ncapabilities, especially with regard to whether or not they have the potential\nfor colour vision. Using microspectrophotometry, we show that the retinae of\nthe giant shovelnose ray (Rhinobatos typus) and the eastern\nshovelnose ray (Aptychotrema rostrata) contain three spectrally\ndistinct cone visual pigments with wavelengths of maximum absorbance\n(λmax) at 477, 502 and 561 nm and at 459, 492 and 553 nm,\nrespectively. The retinae of R. typus and A. rostrata also\ncontain a single type of rod visual pigment with λmax at 504\nand 498 nm, respectively. R. typus, living in the same estuarine\nwaters as A. rostrata, were found to have identical visual pigments\nto R. typus inhabiting coral reef flats, despite a considerable\ndifference in habitat spectral radiance. This is the first time that multiple\ncone visual pigments have been measured directly in an elasmobranch. The\nfinding raises the possibility that some species are able to discriminate\ncolour – a visual ability traditionally thought to be lacking in this\nvertebrate class – and it is evident that the visual ecology of\nelasmobranchs is far more complex than once thought.",

Additionally,\nAnopheles leucokinin I displays sequence similarity to Drosophila\nmelanogaster leucokinin.Using a combination of computational and molecular approaches, a\nfull-length cDNA for a candidate leucokinin-like receptor was isolated from\nA. stephensi, a close relative of A. gambiae. Alignment of\nthe known leucokinin receptors – all G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)–\n with this receptor, identified some key conserved regions within the\nreceptors, notably transmembrane (TM) domains I, II, III, VI and VII.The Anopheles leucokinins and receptor were shown to be a\nfunctional receptor-ligand pair. All three Anopheles leucokinins\ncaused a dose-dependent rise in intracellular calcium\n([Ca2+]i) when applied to S2 cells co-expressing the\nreceptor and an aequorin transgene, with a potency order of\nI>II>III.Drosophila leucokinin was also found to activate the\nAnopheles receptor with a similar EC50 value to\nAnopheles leucokinin I. However, when the Anopheles peptides\nwere applied to the Drosophila receptor, only Anopheles\nleucokinin I and II elicited a rise in [Ca2+]i. This\nsuggests that the Anopheles receptor has a broader specificity for\nleucokinin ligands than the Drosophila receptor.Antisera raised against the Anopheles receptor identified a\ndoublet of approx. 65 and 72 kDa on western blots, consistent with the\npresence of four N-glycosylation sites within the receptor sequence,\nand the known glycosylation of the receptor in Drosophila. In\nAnopheles tubules, as in Drosophila, the receptor was\nlocalised to the stellate cells.Thus we provide the first identification of Anopheles mosquito\nleucokinins (Anopheles leucokinins) and a cognate leucokinin\nreceptor, characterise their interaction and show that Dipteran leucokinin\nsignalling is closely conserved between Drosophila and\nAnopheles.",

Owing to vestibular compensation,\nUL animals gradually restore postural equilibrium and, in a few weeks, swim\nwithout rolling. Important elements of the postural network in the lamprey are\nthe reticulospinal (RS) neurons, which are driven by vestibular input and\ntransmit commands for postural corrections to the spinal cord. As shown\npreviously, a loss of equilibrium after UL is associated with disappearance of\nvestibular responses in the contralateral group of RS neurons. Are these\nresponses restored in animals after compensation? To answer this question, we\nrecorded vestibular responses in RS neurons (elicited by rotation of the\ncompensated animal in the roll plane) by means of chronically implanted\nelectrodes. We found that the responses re-appeared in the compensated\nanimals. This result supports the hypothesis that the loss of equilibrium\nafter UL was caused by asymmetry in supraspinal motor commands, and the\nrecovery of postural control in compensated animals was due to a restoration\nof symmetry.",

To address this\nquestion, groups of fasted rats swam at moderate intensity for 30 min, each\nanimal with a lead weight equivalent to 0.5% body mass attached to its tail,\nfollowed by a 3 min high intensity swim with a 10% lead weight and a recovery\nperiod of up to 2 hours afterwards. Moderately intense exercise for 30 min\ncaused a decrease in muscle glycogen levels in the mixed, white and red\ngastrocnemius and the mixed quadriceps muscles, and a further rapid fall\noccurred in response to the 3 min sprint effort. During recovery, glycogen\nincreased to comparable or above pre-sprint levels across all muscles, and\nthis occurred to a large extent at the expense of net carbon sources other\nthan lactate, with these carbon sources accounting for at least 36–65%\nof the glycogen deposited. The sustained dephosphorylation-mediated activation\nof glycogen synthase, but not the changes in glucose 6-phosphate levels, most\nprobably played an important role in enabling the replenishment of muscle\nglycogen stores.

Like diadromous\ncrabs, the anterior gills of this hololimnetic trichodactylid exhibit a highly\nattenuated (2–5 μm), symmetrical epithelium on both lamellar\nsurfaces. In sharp contrast, the posterior gill lamellar epithelia are\nmarkedly asymmetrical. Their proximal side consists of thick (18–20μ\nm) cells, displaying features typical of a transporting epithelium, while\nthe distal epithelium is thin (3–10 μm) and formed entirely by apical\npillar cell flanges. Both anterior and posterior gills express\nNa+/K+- and V-ATPases. Phylogenetic analysis of partial\ncDNA sequences for the Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit and\nV-ATPase B-subunit among various crab species confirmed the previous\nclassification and grouping of D. pagei based on morphological\ncriteria. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR clearly showed that mRNA for both ion pump\nsubunits is more intensely expressed in posterior gills.\nNa+/K+-ATPase activity in the posterior gills was nearly\nfourfold that of anterior gills, while V-ATPase and F-ATPase activities did\nnot differ. A negative short-circuit current (Isc) was\nmeasured using the distal side of split, posterior gill lamellae, mounted in a\nmodified Ussing chamber and perfused symmetrically with identical\nhemolymph-like salines. Although hemolymph-side ouabain did not affect this\ncurrent, concanamycin significantly reduced Isc without\naltering preparation conductance, suggesting V-ATPase-driven\nCl– absorption on the distal side of the posterior gill\nlamellae, as known to occur in diadromous crabs adapted to freshwater. These\nfindings suggest that active Na+ uptake predominates across the\nthick proximal epithelium, and Cl– uptake across the thin,\ndistal epithelium of the posterior gill lamellae.",

During vertical dives to 102–135 m,\nguillemots regulated their speed during descent and much of ascent to about\n1.6±0.2 m s–1. Stroke rate declined very gradually\nwith depth, with little or no gliding between strokes. Entire strokes from 2 m\nto 20 m depth had similar forward thrust on upstroke vs downstroke,\nwhereas at deeper depths and during horizontal swimming there was much greater\nthrust on the downstroke. Despite this distinct transition, these differences\nhad small effect (<6%) on our estimates of mechanical cost to propel the\nbody fuselage, which did not include drag of the wings. Work\nstroke–1 was quite high as speed increased dramatically in\nthe first 5 m of descent against high buoyancy. Thereafter, speed and\nassociated drag increased gradually as buoyancy slowly declined, so that\nmechanical work stroke–1 during the rest of descent stayed\nrelatively constant. Similar work stroke–1 was maintained\nduring non-pursuit swimming at the bottom, and during powered ascent to the\ndepth of neutral buoyancy (about 71 m). Even with adjustments in respiratory\nair volume of ±60%, modeled work against buoyancy was important mainly\nin the top 15 m of descent, after which almost all work was against drag. Drag\nwas in fact underestimated, as our values did not include enhancement of drag\nby altered flow around active swimmers. With increasing buoyancy during ascent\nabove 71 m, stroke rate, glide periods, stroke acceleration patterns, body\nangle and work stroke–1 were far more variable than during\ndescent; however, mean speed remained fairly constant until buoyancy increased\nrapidly near the surface. For dives to depths >20 m, drag is by far the\nmain component of mechanical work for these diving birds, and speed may be\nregulated to keep work against drag within a relatively narrow range.",

Some four-winged insects, such as\ndragonflies, move each wing independently and therefore may alter the relative\ntiming between the fore- and hindwing stroke cycles. The significance of\nmodifying the phase relationship between fore- and hindwing stroke kinematics\non total lift production is difficult to assess in the flying animal because\nthe effect of wing-wake interference critically depends on the complex wake\npattern produced by the two beating wings. Here we investigate the effect of\nchanging the fore- and hindwing stroke-phase relationship during hovering\nflight conditions on the aerodynamic performance of each flapping wing by\nusing a dynamically scaled electromechanical insect model. By varying the\nrelative phase difference between fore- and hindwing stroke cycles we found\nthat the performance of the forewing remains approximately constant, while\nhindwing lift production may vary by a factor of two. Hindwing lift modulation\nappears to be due to two different fluid dynamic phenomenons: leading edge\nvortex destruction and changes in strength and orientation of the local flow\nvector. Unexpectedly, the hindwing regains aerodynamic performance near to\nthat of the wing free from forewing wake interference, when the motion of the\nhindwing leads the forewing by around a quarter of the stroke cycle. This\nkinematic relationship between hind- and forewing closely matches the\nphase-shift commonly used by locusts and some dragonflies in climbing and\nforward flight. The experiments support previous assumptions that active\nneuromuscular control of fore- and hindwing stroke phase might enable\ndragonflies and other functionally four-winged insects to manipulate\nipsilateral flight force production without further changes in wing beat\nkinematics.",

The enhanced force obtained by a stretch\nof 20% resting muscle length (l0) at low temperature was\nas high as the force obtained by direct stimulation. The phenomenon was not\ndependent on the velocity but on the amplitude of stretch. The enhanced force\nobeyed the length-force relationship when a stretch was long enough. The above\nresults were observed when the frogs were kept at room temperature\n(20-22°C). Measurements were also taken at low temperature (4°C); when\nfrogs were kept at low temperature for more than 2 months, twitch force\nobtained without stretch was considerably higher at l0.\nThe amplitude of the action potential recorded extracellularly from the muscle\nsurface increased remarkably after a stretch, but was same before and after a\nstretch when recorded from the nerve innervating muscle. The effects of\ntemperature on twitch and tetanic force by direct or indirect stimulation\nwithout stretch were also studied as basic data of the stretch experiment. The\nresults from this study suggest that stretch-induced force enhancement in a\nnerve-muscle preparation is caused by an increase in the transmission rate\nbetween nerve and muscle, and the amplitude of the enhanced force is\ndetermined by the length-force relationship of the muscle.

        "abstract": "A putative glucose transporter, GLUT1, is reported for Atlantic cod\nGadus morhua. A combination of RT-PCR, RLM-RACE and genome walking\nwere used to articulate a 4560 bp cDNA (GenBank accession number AY526497). It\ncontains a 149 bp 5′ UTR, a 1470 bp open reading frame and a 2941 bp\n3′ UTR. At the nucleotide level, the cod GLUT1 ORF shares 78.2% sequence\nidentity to human GLUT1 and the deduced amino acid sequence clusters with\nGLUT1s from rainbow trout and carp. GLUT1 transcript is highly expressed in\nbrain, gill, heart and kidney and expressed to a lower level in at least six\nother tissues. Expression is evident immediately upon fertilization of eggs.\nSix hours of hypoxia at 40% DO2 did not alter expression levels in\nbrain, gill, heart or kidney. The level of expression is not substantially\naltered in heart during low temperature challenge, although there is a\nsuggestion that colder temperature could lead to lower levels of expression,\nconsistent with the concept that the cold-acclimated heart has a reduced\ndependence upon glucose as a metabolic fuel. Two months of starvation did not\nsignificantly alter the level of expression of GLUT1 in heart. This is in\nmarked contrast to the rat heart where fasting leads to a substantial decrease\nin GLUT1 levels. Overall, there is a ubiquitous tissue distribution of GLUT1,\nconsistent with other species, and the level of gene expression, especially in\nheart, is relatively constant over a range of physiological conditions.",

Here we report that systemically administered\nmanganese can act as an effective MRI contrast agent for quick and\nnon-invasive imaging of the nervous system and other complex anatomical\nstructures in a small aquatic animal. Due to the tendency of manganese ions to\ndifferentially accumulate in most soft tissues, higher overall signal\nintensity and strongly improved contrast between structures yield data well\nsuited for digital post-processing into three-dimensional models. Within a few\nhours this technique can efficiently generate anatomical images that are not\nobtainable with conventional methods, thus demonstrating a new and exciting\napproach to invertebrate research.",

        "abstract": "It is widely appreciated that the selection and modulation of locomotor\ncircuits are dependent on the actions of higher-order projection neurons. In\nthe leech, Hirudo medicinalis, locomotion is modulated by a number of\ncephalic projection neurons that descend from the subesophageal ganglion in\nthe head. Specifically, descending brain interneuron Tr2 functions as a\ncommand-like neuron that can terminate or sometimes trigger fictive swimming.\nIn this study, we demonstrate that Tr2 is dye coupled to the dopaminergic\nneural network distributed in the head brain. These findings represent the\nfirst anatomical evidence in support of dopamine (DA) playing a role in the\nmodulation of locomotion in the leech. In addition, we have determined that\nbath application of DA to the brain and entire nerve cord reliably and rapidly\nterminates swimming in all preparations exhibiting fictive swimming. By\ncontrast, DA application to nerve cords expressing ongoing fictive crawling\ndoes not inhibit this motor rhythm. Furthermore, we show that Tr2 receives\nrhythmic feedback from the crawl central pattern generator. For example, Tr2\nreceives inhibitory post-synaptic potentials during the elongation phase of\neach crawl cycle. When crawling is not expressed, spontaneous inhibitory\npost-synaptic potentials in Tr2 correlate in time with spontaneous excitatory\npost-synaptic potentials in the CV motor neuron, a circular muscle excitor\nthat bursts during the elongation phase of crawling. Our data are consistent\nwith the idea that DA biases the nervous system to produce locomotion in the\nform of crawling.",

In this report we further\nexamine the nature of the previously described carbonic anhydrase and test the\nhypothesis that its pattern of expression is consistent with a role in gut\nalkalization. Additionally we take advantage of the recently published genome\nof the mosquito Anopheles gambiae to assess the complexity of the\ncarbonic anhydrase gene family in these insects. We report here that the\npreviously described carbonic anhydrase from Aedes aegypti is similar\nto mammalian CA IV in that it is a GPI-linked peripheral membrane protein.\nIn situ hybridization analyses identify multiple locations of\ncarbonic anhydrase expression in the larval mosquito. An antibody prepared\nagainst a peptide sequence specific to the Aedes aegypti GPI-linked\ncarbonic anhydrase labels plasma membranes of a number of cell types including\nneuronal cells and muscles. A previously undescribed subset of gut muscles is\nspecifically identified by carbonic anhydrase immunohistochemistry.\nBioinformatic analyses using the Ensembl automatic analysis pipeline show that\nthere are at least 14 carbonic anhydrase genes in the Anopheles\ngambiae genome, including a homologue to the GPI-linked gene product\ndescribed herein. Therefore, as in mammals which similarly possess numerous\ncarbonic anhydrase genes, insects require a large family of these genes to\nhandle the complex metabolic pathways influenced by carbonic anhydrases and\ntheir substrates.",

        "abstract": "The energy metabolism of hibernators has not been characterized for\nnormothermic fasting, and our goal was to quantify oxidative fuel selection of\nnon-hibernating woodchucks Marmota monax during prolonged food\ndeprivation. Indirect calorimetry and nitrogen excretion measurements were\nused to assess changes in metabolic rate\n(V̇O2), fuel\nselection and composition of nitrogen wastes, as well as seasonal differences.\nFor reference, matching experiments were also performed on rabbits. The\nresults show that woodchucks have a higher metabolic rate in summer (271μ\nmol O2 kg-1 min-1) than in spring (200μ\nmol O2 kg-1 min-1) and that\nfasting-induced metabolic depression is only possible in summer (-25% in 14\ndays). The metabolic rate of rabbits is high at all times (383 μmol\nO2 kg-1 min-1), but they show a more rapid\ndepression in response to fasting (-32% in 7 days). Woodchucks have a\nnaturally low reliance on proteins in the fed state (accounting for 8%\nV̇O2 in spring;\n17% V̇O2 in\nsummer; vs 28%\nV̇O2 in rabbits)\nand are able to decrease it even further during fasting (spring, 5%\nV̇O2; summer, 6%\nV̇O2; vs\n20% V̇O2 in\nrabbits). This study shows that, apart from their notorious capacity for\nhibernation, woodchucks are particularly well adapted for normothermic\nfasting. Their ability to cope with prolonged food deprivation is based on a\nseries of integrated responses eliciting deep metabolic depression and a rapid\nchange in fuel selection to spare limited protein reserves. Information\npresently available on prolonged fasting suggests that such an ability for\nmetabolic depression, possibly down to minimal levels still compatible with\nnormothermic life, may be common among mammals. In contrast, the extreme\nprotein sparing demonstrated in woodchucks is a unique metabolic feature of\nfasting champions.",

Contraction of this muscle\nreduces the blood flow into the abdominal aorta, thereby, playing a role in\nthe regulation of the blood distribution in Aplysia. Here, we show\nthe contractility of the vasoconstrictor muscle is modulated by three types of\nendogenous peptides, Aplysia mytilus inhibitory peptide-related\npeptides (AMRP), enterin and NdWFamide. Immunohistochemistry showed that\nputative neuronal processes containing the three peptides exist in the\nvasoconstrictor muscle.

Enterin hyperpolarized the resting potential of the\nmuscle and decreased the amplitude of the excitatory junction potential (EJP).\nAMRP also inhibited the nerve-evoked contraction although its action on the\nACh-induced contraction was variable. AMRP also reduced the size of EJP, but\nhad no effect on the resting potential of the muscle. NdWFamide enhanced the\nnerve-evoked contraction but not the ACh-induced contraction. NdWFamide\naugmented EJP without affecting the resting potential of the muscle.

The increase in cold-tolerance was\nprobably due to a concomitant increase in cryoprotectants as measured by\nhemolymph osmolality (488–695 mOsmol kg–1). In contrast\nto the gradual increase in cold-tolerance, larvae exhibited two distinct\nphases of reduced rates of water loss. The first phase was an abrupt sixfold\ndecrease to 0.57 μg mm–2 h–1 between 3\nand 16 October.

The reduction in rates of water loss during the first\nphase were probably the result of decreased respiratory water loss as the\nlarvae entered diapause, and possibly reduced cuticular water loss as larvae\nincreased the amount of their cuticular hydrocarbons. Interestingly, the first\nphase of reduced water loss was associated with, and may have been cued by, a\nreduction in the water potential of the gall tissues surrounding the larvae.\nThe second phase was a more subtle fourfold reduction in rates of water loss\noccurring between 16 October and 11 December.

        "abstract": "Thingvallavatn, the largest and one of the oldest lakes in Iceland,\ncontains four morphs of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus. Dwarf\nbenthic (DB), large benthic (LB), planktivorous (PL) and piscivorous (PI)\nmorphs can be distinguished and differ markedly in head morphology,\ncolouration and maximum fork length (FLmax), reflecting\ntheir different resource specialisations within the lake. The four morphs in\nThingvallavatn are thought to have been isolated for approximately 10 000\nyears, since shortly after the end of the last Ice Age.We tested the null hypothesis that the pattern of muscle fibre recruitment\nwas the same in all morphs, reflecting their recent diversification. The\ncross-sectional areas of fast and slow muscle fibres were measured at 0.7\nFL in 46 DB morphs, 23 LB morphs, 24 PL morphs and 22 PI morphs, and\nthe ages of the charr were estimated using sacculus otoliths. In fish larger\nthan 10 g, the maximum fibre diameter scaled with body mass\n(Mb)0.18 for both fibre types in all morphs.\nThe number of myonuclei per cm fibre length increased with fibre diameter, but\nwas similar between morphs. On average, at 60 μm diameter, there were 2264\nnuclei cm–1 in slow fibres and 1126 nuclei\ncm–1 in fast fibres. The absence of fibres of diameter\n4–10 μm was used to determine the FL at which muscle fibre\nrecruitment stopped. Slow fibre number increased with body length in all\nmorphs, scaling with Mb0.45. In contrast, the\nrecruitment of fast muscle fibres continued until a clearly identifiable\nFL, corresponding to 18–19 cm in the dwarf morph, 24–26\ncm in the pelagic morph, 32–33 cm in the large benthic morph and\n34–35 cm in the piscivorous morph. The maximum fast fibre number\n(FNmax) in the dwarf morph (6.97×104) was\n56.5% of that found in the LB and PI morphs combined\n(1.23×105) (P<0.001). Muscle fibre recruitment\ncontinued until a threshold body size and occurred at a range of ages,\nstarting at 4+ years in the DB morph and 7+ years in the LB and PI morphs. Our\nnull hypothesis was therefore rejected for fast muscle and it was concluded\nthat the dwarf condition was associated with a reduction in fibre number.We then investigated whether variations in development temperature\nassociated with different spawning sites and periods were responsible for the\nobserved differences in muscle cellularity between morphs. Embryos from the\nDB, LB and PL morphs were incubated at temperature regimes simulating cold\nsubterranean spring-fed sites (2.2–3.2°C) and the general lakebed\n(4–7°C). Myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) were identified using\nspecific antibodies to Paired box protein 7 (Pax 7), Forkhead box protein\nK1-α (FoxK1-α), MyoD and Myf-5. The progeny showed no evidence of\ndevelopmental plasticity in the numbers of either MPCs or muscle fibres.\nJuveniles and adult stages of the DB and LB morphs coexist and have a similar\ndiet. We therefore conclude that the reduction in FNmax in\nthe dwarf morph probably has a genetic basis and that gene networks regulating\nmyotube production are under high selection pressure. To explain these\nfindings we propose that there is an optimal fibre size, and hence number,\nwhich varies with maximum body size and reflects a trade-off between\ndiffusional constraints on fibre diameter and the energy costs of maintaining\nionic gradients. The predictions of the optimal fibre size hypothesis and its\nconsequences for the adaptive evolution of muscle architecture in fishes are\nbriefly discussed.",

Based on the postulate that\nthis basic cellular mechanism has been established since the early stages of\nevolution, it has been hypothesized that it could be the consequence of an\nearly adaptation strategy to maintain cellular oxygenation within the same low\nand primitive range. To test this hypothesis we studied the basic mechanisms\nof oxygen regulation in podocopid ostracods, minute crustaceans that have\nexisted on earth for at least 500 million years. Podocopids lack any\nregulatory mechanism for adapting their ventilation to cope with changes in\nwater oxygenation, and instead adjust their tissue oxygenation status by\nmigrating through the O2 gradient to sediment layers where the\nPO2 of the water is 3–5 kPa. Experimental\nmanipulation of the O2 profile induced their vertical migration to\nfollow this precise water PO2 and demonstrates\nthe existence of a regulation strategy. This strategy must be associated with\nthe lower PO2 values within the animal's\ncarapace valves, showing that podocopids can actively regulate their tissue\nPO2 at constant but even lower values than the\nwater. In conclusion, the low tissue PO2\nstrategy could have existed in early crustaceans and, by extension, in early\nanimals.",

We investigated whether learned olfactory cues\ncan trigger visual and navigational memories in honeybees that assist them in\nnavigating back to a known food source. In a series of experiments, marked\nbees were trained to forage at one or more sugar water feeders, placed at\ndifferent outdoor locations and carrying different scents or colours. We then\ntested the ability of these bees to recall the locations (or colours) of these\nfood sites and to fly to them, when the training scents were blown into the\nhive, and the scents and food at the feeders were removed. The results show\nthat (1) bees, trained to a single-scented feeder at a given location, can be\ninduced to fly to the same location by blowing the scent into the hive; (2)\nbees, trained to two feeders, each placed at a different location and carrying\na different scent, can be induced to fly to either location by blowing the\nappropriate scent into the hive; and (3) bees, trained to two feeders, each\ndecorated with a different colour and carrying a different scent, can be\ninduced to find a feeder of either colour by blowing the appropriate scent\ninto the hive. Thus, familiar scents can trigger navigational and visual\nmemories in experienced bees.

We have previously shown that fish have an acute\nsensitivity to infrasound also, with acceleration thresholds in the range of\n10–5 m s–2. In addition, infrasound at high\nintensities around 10–2 m s–2 elicits strong\nand sustained avoidance responses in several fish species. In the present\nstudy, the possible triggering of C-escapes by infrasonic single-cycle\nvibrations was examined in juvenile roach Rutilus rutilus. The fish\nwere accelerated in a controlled and quantifiable manner using a swing system.\nThe applied stimuli simulated essential components of the accelerations that a\nsmall fish would encounter in the hydrodynamic flow field produced by a\npredatory fish. Typical C- and S-type escape responses were induced by\naccelerations within the infrasonic range with a threshold of 0.023 m\ns–2 for an initial acceleration at 6.7 Hz. Response\ntrajectories were on average in the same direction as the initial\nacceleration. Unexpectedly, startle behaviours mainly occurred in the trailing\nhalf of the test chamber, in which the fish were subjected to linear\nacceleration in combination with compression, i.e. the expected stimuli\nproduced by an approaching predator. Very few responses were observed in the\nleading half of the test chamber, where the fish were subjected to\nacceleration and rarefaction, i.e. the stimuli expected from a suction type of\npredator.

        "abstract": "Adult actinopterygian fishes typically perform steady forward swimming\nusing either their pectoral fins or their body axis as the primary propulsor.\nIn most species, when axial undulation is employed for swimming, the pectoral\nfins are tucked (i.e. adducted) against the body; conversely, when pectoral\nfins are beating, the body axis is held straight. In contrast to adults,\nlarval fishes can combine their pectoral fin and body-axis movements during\nlocomotion; however, little is known about how these locomotor modes are\ncoordinated. With this study we provide a detailed analysis of the coordinated\nfin and axial movements during slow and fast swimming by examining forward\nlocomotion in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio L.). In addition, we\ndescribe the musculature that powers pectoral fin movement in larval zebrafish\nand discuss its functional implications. As larvae, zebrafish alternate their\npectoral fins during slow swimming (0.011±0.001 mm\nms–1) in conjunction with axial undulations of the same\nfrequency (18–28 Hz). During fast swimming (0.109±0.030 mm\nms–1; 36–67 Hz), the fins are tucked against the body\nand propulsion occurs by axial undulation alone. We show that during swimming,\nlarval fishes can use a similar limb–axis coordination pattern to that\nof walking and running salamanders. We suggest that the fin–axis\ncoordination observed in larval zebrafish may be attributed to a primitive\nneural circuit and that early terrestrial vertebrates may have gained the\nability to coordinate limbs and lateral bending by retaining a larval central\npattern generator for limb–axis coordination in the adult life history\nstage.",

Myf-5 and MyoD transcripts were\ninitially limited to the adaxial cells, but Myf-5 expression spread\nlaterally into the presomitic mesoderm before somite formation. Two distinct\nbands of staining could be seen corresponding to the cellular fields of the\nforming somites, but as each furrow delineated, Myf-5 mRNA levels\ndeclined. Upon somite formation, MyoD expression spread laterally to\nencompass the full somite width. Expression of the myogenin gene was\nalso switched on during somite formation, and expression of both transcripts\npersisted until the somites became chevron-shaped. Expression of MyoD\nwas then downregulated shortly before myogenin. The expression\npatterns of the carp myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) genes most-closely\nresembled that seen in the zebrafish rather than the rainbow trout (where\nexpression of MyoD remains restricted to the adaxial domain of the\nsomite for a prolonged period) or the herring (where expression of\nMyoD persists longer than that of myogenin).

In this study\nwe use a dynamically scaled robotic model of the fruit fly Drosophila\nmelanogaster to investigate the forces produced by a wing revolving at\nconstant angular velocity while simultaneously translating at velocities\nappropriate for forward flight. Because the forward and angular velocities\nwere constant wing inertia was negligible, and the measured forces can be\nattributed to fluid dynamic phenomena. The combined forward and revolving\nmotions of the wing produce a time-dependent free-stream velocity profile,\nwhich suggests that added mass forces make a contribution to the measured\nforces.

Lift and drag coefficients are calculated from the force traces after\nsubtracting the contributions due to added mass. The lift and drag\ncoefficients, for fixed angle of attack, are not constant for non-zero advance\nratios, but rather vary in magnitude throughout the stroke. This observation\nimplies that modifications of the quasi-steady model are required in order to\npredict accurately the instantaneous forces produced during forward flight. We\nshow that the dependence of the lift and drag coefficients upon advance ratio\nand stroke position can be characterized effectively in terms of the tip\nvelocity ratio – the ratio of the chordwise components of flow velocity\nat the wing tip due to translation and revolution. On this basis we develop a\nmodified quasi-steady model that can account for the varying magnitudes of the\nlift and drag coefficients.

Neither the wingbeat frequency nor wingbeat amplitude change\nsignificantly over the investigated speed range and consequently dimensionless\nmeasures that compare timescales of flapping vs. timescales due to\nthe mean flow vary in direct proportion to the mean flow itself, with no\nconstant or slowly varying intervals. The only significant kinematic\nvariations come from changes in the upstroke timing (downstroke fraction) and\nthe upstroke wing folding (span ratio), consistent with the gradual\nvariations, primarily in the upstroke wake, previously reported.The relationship between measured wake geometry and wingbeat kinematics can\nbe qualitatively explained by presumed self-induced convection and deformation\nof the wake between its initial formation and later measurement, and varies in\na predictable way with flight speed. Although coarse details of the wake\ngeometry accord well with the kinematic measurements, there is no simple\nexplanation based on these observed kinematics alone that accounts for the\nmeasured asymmetries of circulation magnitude in starting and stopping vortex\nstructures.

Two horizontal\nsubstrates were used: a flat `terrestrial' trackway with a force platform\nintegrated into the surface and a cylindrical `arboreal' trackway (20.3 mm\ndiameter) with a force-transducer instrumented region. On both terrestrial and\narboreal substrates, fore limbs exhibited higher vertical impulse and peak\nvertical force than hind limbs. Although vertical limb impulses were lower on\nthe terrestrial substrate than on the arboreal support, this was probably due\nto speed effects because the opossums refused to move as quickly on the\narboreal trackway. Vertical impulse decreased significantly faster with speed\non the arboreal substrate because most of these trials were relatively slow,\nand stance duration decreased with speed more rapidly at these lower speeds.\nWhile braking and propulsive roles were more segregated between limbs on the\nterrestrial trackway, fore limbs were dominant both in braking and in\npropulsion on the arboreal trackway. Both fore and hind limbs exerted\nequivalently strong, medially directed limb forces on the arboreal trackway\nand laterally directed limb forces on the terrestrial trackway. We propose\nthat the modifications in substrate reaction force on the arboreal trackway\nare due to the differential placement of the limbs about the dorsolateral\naspect of the branch. Specifically, the pes typically made contact with the\nbranch lower and more laterally than the manus, which may explain the\nsignificantly lower required coefficient of friction in the fore limbs\nrelative to the hind limbs.",

        "abstract": "Here we show, by qualitative free- and tethered-flight flow visualization,\nthat dragonflies fly by using unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms to generate\nhigh-lift, leading-edge vortices. In normal free flight, dragonflies use\ncounterstroking kinematics, with a leading-edge vortex (LEV) on the forewing\ndownstroke, attached flow on the forewing upstroke, and attached flow on the\nhindwing throughout. Accelerating dragonflies switch to in-phase wing-beats\nwith highly separated downstroke flows, with a single LEV attached across both\nthe fore- and hindwings. We use smoke visualizations to distinguish between\nthe three simplest local analytical solutions of the Navier–Stokes\nequations yielding flow separation resulting in a LEV. The LEV is an open\nU-shaped separation, continuous across the thorax, running parallel to the\nwing leading edge and inflecting at the tips to form wingtip vortices. Air\nspirals in to a free-slip critical point over the centreline as the LEV grows.\nSpanwise flow is not a dominant feature of the flow field – spanwise\nflows sometimes run from wingtip to centreline, or vice versa –\ndepending on the degree of sideslip. LEV formation always coincides with rapid\nincreases in angle of attack, and the smoke visualizations clearly show the\nformation of LEVs whenever a rapid increase in angle of attack occurs. There\nis no discrete starting vortex. Instead, a shear layer forms behind the\ntrailing edge whenever the wing is at a non-zero angle of attack, and rolls\nup, under Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, into a series of transverse\nvortices with circulation of opposite sign to the circulation around the wing\nand LEV. The flow fields produced by dragonflies differ qualitatively from\nthose published for mechanical models of dragonflies, fruitflies and\nhawkmoths, which preclude natural wing interactions. However, controlled\nparametric experiments show that, provided the Strouhal number is appropriate\nand the natural interaction between left and right wings can occur, even a\nsimple plunging plate can reproduce the detailed features of the flow seen in\ndragonflies. In our models, and in dragonflies, it appears that stability of\nthe LEV is achieved by a general mechanism whereby flapping kinematics are\nconfigured so that a LEV would be expected to form naturally over the wing and\nremain attached for the duration of the stroke. However, the actual formation\nand shedding of the LEV is controlled by wing angle of attack, which\ndragonflies can vary through both extremes, from zero up to a range that leads\nto immediate flow separation at any time during a wing stroke.",

        "abstract": "Studies of insect flight have focused on aerodynamic lift, both in\nquasi-steady and unsteady regimes. This is partly influenced by the choice of\nhovering motions along a horizontal stroke plane, where aerodynamic drag makes\nno contribution to the vertical force. In contrast, some of the best hoverers–\n dragonflies and hoverflies – employ inclined stroke planes,\nwhere the drag in the down- and upstrokes does not cancel each other. Here,\ncomputation of an idealized dragonfly wing motion shows that a dragonfly uses\ndrag to support about three quarters of its weight. This can explain an\nanomalous factor of four in previous estimates of dragonfly lift coefficients,\nwhere drag was assumed to be small.To investigate force generation and energy cost of hovering flight using\ndifferent combination of lift and drag, I study a family of wing motion\nparameterized by the inclined angle of the stroke plane. The lift-to-drag\nratio is no longer a measure of efficiency, except in the case of horizontal\nstroke plane. In addition, because the flow is highly stalled, lift and drag\nare of comparable magnitude, and the aerodynamic efficiency is roughly the\nsame up to an inclined angle about 60°, which curiously agrees with the\nangle observed in dragonfly flight.Finally, the lessons from this special family of wing motion suggests a\nstrategy for improving efficiency of normal hovering, and a unifying view of\ndifferent wing motions employed by insects.",

        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLE",
        "abstract": "We measured the net work performed at hind limb joints in running turkeys\nto determine the source of mechanical power for acceleration. We tested the\nhypothesis that net mechanical work per step increases in proportion to\nacceleration at all four major hind limb joints (hip, knee, ankle and\ntarsometatarsal–phalangeal joint). This hypothesis was based on the idea\nthat all hind limb muscles should contribute mechanical work to maximize\nperformance during accelerations, and a previous study that indicated the\nmechanical power output of the entire turkey hind limb musculature was\nremarkably high. We used high-speed video and force-plate measurements to\nmeasure joint moment, velocity and power output during single foot-contacts of\nrunning accelerations. By measuring steps in which the animals were relatively\nmore or less motivated to accelerate, we obtained data for a range of\naccelerations, all at approximately the same running speed. Net joint work per\nstep increased at the hip and ankle as a function of acceleration. Hip net\nwork per unit body mass was 0.12±0.09 J kg-1 averaged over\nthe five lowest accelerations (–0.22±0.08 m s-2), and\n0.87±0.20 J kg-1 for the five highest accelerations\n(4.86±0.27 m s-2). Ankle work was –0.21±0.11 J\nkg-1 for the lowest accelerations and 0.71±0.28 J\nkg-1 for the highest. The high work output at the ankle is\nconsistent with the idea that elastic mechanisms function to increase muscle\nwork during acceleration. The work performed at the knee and\ntarsometatarsal–phalangeal joint was independent of acceleration in a\nstep. These results support the idea that hip and ankle extensors contribute\nsignificantly to the work necessary to accelerate the body.We also measured the change in joint moment and angular excursion with\nacceleration to determine whether the mechanism for increasing work output at\na joint involved an increase in muscle force or muscle shortening. The\nincrease in joint work at the hip and ankle resulted almost entirely from an\nincrease in joint angular excursion during stance. Hip extension increased by\nmore than threefold from the lowest to the highest accelerations, and the\nangular excursion of the ankle increased from –24.8±4.7° (net\nflexion) at the lowest accelerations to 33.0±12.8° (net extension)\nat the highest accelerations. Mean stance joint moment was unchanged with\nacceleration at the ankle and increased by approximately 35% at the hip across\nthe range of accelerations. These patterns of joint moment and excursion\nindicate that turkeys increase mechanical work for acceleration primarily by\nincreasing muscle shortening, rather than muscle force.",

Mean body angles during descent and\nascent were not vertical. There was large variation in mean descent and ascent\nangles for a given dive depth, which, in turn, caused large variation in\ndescent and ascent duration. Body angles were significantly correlated with\ntime spent at the bottom-phase of the dive. Birds that spent long periods at\nthe bottom exhibited steep body angles during ascent and subsequent descent.\nBy contrast, they adopted shallow body angles after they had short or no\nbottom phases. Our results suggest that macaroni penguins stay at the bottom\nlonger after encountering a good prey patch and then travel to the surface at\nsteep body angles. If they do not encounter prey, they discontinue the dive,\nwithout staying at the bottom, ascend at shallow body angles and descend at\nshallow body angles in a subsequent dive. A shallow body angle can increase\nthe horizontal distance covered during a dive, contributing to the move into a\nmore profitable area in the following dive.

High-speed digital imaging was\nused to record mudskipper escapes in water and on land, and the resulting\nimages were used to calculate intervertebral bending during the preparatory\nphase, peak velocity and acceleration of the center of mass during the\npropulsive phase, and relative timing of movements. Although similar maximum\nvelocities are achieved across environments, terrestrial responses are\ndistinct from aquatic responses. During terrestrial escapes, mudskippers\nproduce greater axial bending in the preparatory phase, but only in the\nposterior region of the body and over a much longer time period. Mudskippers\nalso occasionally produced the `wrong' behavior for a given environment. Thus,\nit appears that the same locomotor morphology is recruited differently by the\ncentral nervous system to produce a distinct behavior appropriate for each\nenvironment.",

The source sound produced at\nthe syrinx contains a fundamental frequency with prominent second and third\nharmonic overtones, but these harmonics are filtered out of the emitted\nsignal. We show by cineradiography that the upper esophagus, oral and nasal\ncavities collect the expired air during vocalization and that the inflated\nesophagus becomes part of the suprasyringeal vocal tract. The level of the\nsecond and third harmonics, relative to the fundamental frequency\n(f0), is reduced in the esophagus and emitted vocalization\ncompared with in the trachea, although these harmonics are still considerably\nhigher in the esophagus than in the emitted signal. When the esophagus is\nprevented from fully inflating, there is a pronounced increase in the level of\nhigher harmonics in the emitted vocalization. Our data suggest that the\ntrachea and esophagus act in series as acoustically separate compartments\nattenuating harmonics by different mechanisms. We hypothesize that the trachea\nbehaves as a tube closed at the syringeal end and with a variable, restricted\nopening at the glottal end that lowers the tracheal first resonance to match\nthe f0 of the coo. The inflated esophagus may function as\na Helmholtz resonator in which the elastic walls form the vibrating mass. Such\na resonator could support the f0 over a range of inflated\nvolumes.",

        "abstract": "Diameters of some white locomotor muscle fibers in the adult blue crab,\nCallinectes sapidus, exceed 500 μm whereas juvenile white fibers\nare <100 μm. It was hypothesized that aerobically dependent processes,\nsuch as metabolic recovery following burst contractions, will be significantly\nimpeded in the large white fibers. In addition, dark aerobic fibers of adults,\nwhich rely on aerobic metabolism for both contraction and recovery, grow as\nlarge as the white fibers. These large aerobic fibers are subdivided, however,\nthus decreasing the effective diameter of each metabolic functional unit and\nenabling aerobic contraction. The two goals of this study were: (1) to\ncharacterize the development of subdivisions in the dark levator muscle fibers\nand (2) to monitor post-contractile metabolism as a function of fiber size in\naerobic and anaerobic levator muscles. Dark levator muscle fibers from crabs\nranging from <0.1 g to >190 g were examined with transmission electron\nmicroscopy to determine the density of mitochondria and subdivision diameters.\nAcross all size classes, there was a constant mitochondrial fractional area\n(25% of the total subdivision area) and subdivision size (mean diameter of\n36.5±2.7 μm). Thus, blue crab dark levator fibers are unusual in\nhaving metabolic functional units (subdivisions) that do not increase in size\nduring development while the contractile functional units (fibers) grow\nhypertrophically. The body mass scaling of post-contractile lactate dynamics\nwas monitored during recovery from anaerobic, burst exercise in white and dark\nmuscle, and in hemolymph. There were no differences among size classes in\nlactate accumulation during exercise in either muscle. However, in white\nfibers from large crabs, lactate continued to increase after exercise, and\nlactate removal from tissues required a much longer period of time relative to\nsmaller crabs. Differences in lactate removal among size classes were less\npronounced in dark fibers, and post-contractile lactate accumulation was\nsignificantly higher in white than in dark fibers from large animals. These\ndata suggest that the large white fibers invoke anaerobic metabolism following\ncontraction to accelerate certain phases of metabolic recovery that otherwise\nwould be overly slow. This implies that, in addition to the typical\nmass-specific decrease in oxidative capacity that accompanies increases in\nanimal mass, aerobic metabolic processes become increasingly limited by\nsurface area to volume and intracellular diffusion constraints in developing\nwhite muscle fibers.",

For\nthe first time we show that the regular propagating anterograde waves that\noccur in the zebrafish larval gut before and around the onset [at 5–6\ndays post fertilization (d.p.f.)] of feeding are modulated by acetylcholine or\natropine, PACAP and NKA (neurokinin A).

To explore patterns of energy use and\nbehavior during voluntary exercise, we developed methods allowing nearly\ncontinuous measurements of metabolic rates in freely behaving small mammals,\nwith high temporal resolution over periods of several days. We used this\napproach to examine relationships between ambient temperature\n(Ta), locomotor behavior and energy costs in the deer\nmouse, a small mammal that routinely encounters a large range of temperatures\nin its natural habitat. We tested for individual consistency in running\nbehavior and metabolic traits, and determined how locomotor costs vary with\nspeed and Ta. Because of the importance of\nthermoregulatory costs in small mammals, we checked for substitution of\nexercise heat for thermostatic heat production at Ta below\nthe thermal neutral zone and determined the fraction of the daily energy\nbudget comprising exercise costs.Locomotor behavior was highly variable among individuals but had high\nrepeatability, at least over short intervals. We found few temperature-related\nchanges in speed or distance run, but Ta strongly affected\nenergy costs. Partial substitution of exercise heat for thermogenic heat\noccurred at low Ta. This reduced energy expenditure during\nlow-temperature running by 23–37%, but running costs comprised a fairly\nminor fraction of the energy budget, so the daily energy savings via\nsubstitution were much smaller. Deer mice did not adjust running speed to\nmaximize metabolic economy, as they seldom used the high speeds that provide\nthe lowest cost of transport. The highest voluntary speeds (4–5 km\nh-1) were almost always below the predicted maximal aerobic speed,\nand were much less than the species' maximal sprint speed. Maximum voluntarily\nattained rates of oxygen consumption\n(V̇O2) were\nhighest at low Ta, but rarely approached maximal\nV̇O2 during forced\ntreadmill exercise. Mean respiratory exchange ratios coincident with maximal\nvoluntary V̇O2\nincreased slightly as Ta declined, but were always below\n1.0 (another indication that metabolic rate was less than the aerobic\nmaximum).

In particular, an estimate was made of the energetic cost of diving in\norder to determine the proportion of dives that may exceed the calculated\naerobic dive limit (cADL; estimated usable O2 stores/estimated rate\nof oxygen consumption during diving).An implanted data logger enabled fh and diving\nbehaviour to be monitored from 10 free-ranging king penguins during their\nbreeding period. Using previously determined calibration equations, it was\npossible to estimate rate of oxygen consumption\n(V̇O2) when the\nbirds were ashore and during various phases of their foraging trips. Diving\nbehaviour showed a clear diurnal pattern, with a mixture of deep (>40 m),\nlong (>3 min) and shallow (<40 m), short (<3 min) dives from dawn to\ndusk and shallow, short dives at night. Heart rate during dive bouts and dive\ncycles (dive + post-dive interval) was 42% greater than that when the birds\nwere ashore. During diving, fh was similar to the `ashore'\nvalue (87±4 beats min–1), but it did decline to 76% of\nthe value recorded from king penguins resting in water. During the first hour\nafter a diving bout, fh was significantly higher than the\naverage value during diving (101±4 beats min–1) and\nfor the remainder of the dive bout.Rates of oxygen consumption estimated from these (and other) values of\nfh indicate that when at sea, metabolic rate (MR) was 83%\ngreater than that when the birds were ashore [3.15 W kg–1\n(–0.71, +0.93), where the values in parentheses are the computed\nstandard errors of the estimate], while during diving bouts and dive cycles,\nit was 73% greater than the `ashore' value. Although estimated MR during the\ntotal period between dive bouts was not significantly different from that\nduring dive bouts [5.44 W kg–1 (–0.30, +0.32)], MR\nduring the first hour following a dive bout was 52% greater than that during a\ndiving bout. It is suggested that this large increase following diving\n(foraging) activity is, at least in part, the result of rewarming the body,\nwhich occurs at the end of a diving bout. From the measured behaviour and\nestimated values of\nV̇O2, it was\nevident that approximately 35% of the dives were in excess of the cADL. Even\nif V̇O2 during\ndiving was assumed to be the same as when the birds were resting on water,\napproximately 20% of dives would exceed the cADL. As\nV̇O2 during diving\nis, in fact, that estimated for a complete dive cycle, it is quite feasible\nthat V̇O2 during\ndiving itself is less than that measured for birds resting in water. It is\nsuggested that the regional hypothermia that has been recorded in this species\nduring diving bouts may be at least a contributing factor to such\nhypometabolism.",

        "abstract": "Using the macro-patch clamp technique, we show that cardiac myocytes\nisolated from the heart of the oyster Crassostrea gigas possess\nseveral types of voltage-activated ionic currents. (1) A classical\nnon-inactivating potassium current of the IK type that is inhibited\nby tetraethyl ammonium and shows an outward rectification and a slow\nactivation. (2) A potassium current of the IA type that shows rapid\nactivation and inactivation, and is blocked by 4-amino pyridine or preliminary\ndepolarisation. (3) A potassium calcium-dependent current that is inhibited by\ncharybdotoxin, activated by strong depolarisations and shows a large\nconductance. (4) A calcium inward current of the L-type that is inhibited by\nverapamil, cobalt and high concentrations of cadmium. This current is\nidentified in most cells, but a T-type calcium current and classical fast\nsodium current are only identified in few cells, and only after a strong\nhyperpolarizing pulse. This suggests that these channels are normally\ninactivated in cultured cells and are not involved in the spontaneous activity\nof these cells. When they exist, the fast sodium channel is blocked by\ntetrodotoxin. The L-type calcium conductance is increased by serotonin. The\nidentification in cultured oyster atrial cells of classical ionic currents,\nwhich are observed in most vertebrate species but only in a few species of\nmolluscs, demonstrates that these cells are an interesting model. Moreover the\nviability and the electrophysiological properties of these cells are not\nsignificantly modified by freezing and thawing, thus increasing their\nusefulness in various bioassays.",

        "origin": "RESEARCH ARTICLE",
        "abstract": "The kinematics of swimming frogs have been studied extensively in the past\nand, based on these results, hypotheses regarding the hydrodynamics of frog\nswimming can be generated. To test these hypotheses we used digital particle\nimage velocimetry (DPIV) to quantify the flow structure of the wake produced\nby the feet during the propulsion phase of the kick of surface swimming frogs\n(Rana pipiens). These frogs use two different gaits, asynchronous and\nsynchronous kicking, and the magnitude of the thrust produced by the feet\ndiffers between asynchronous (34±5.4 mN foot–1) and\nsynchronous kicking (71±13.3 mN foot–1), as does\nmaximum swimming speed, with higher swimming speed and forces produced during\nthe synchronous kicks. Previous studies have suggested that an interaction\nbetween the feet, resulting in a single posteriorly directed fluid jet, as the\nfeet come together at the end of synchronous kicks, may augment force\nproduction. Our results show, however, that each foot produces its own\ndistinct vortex ring, in both asynchronous and synchronous kicking of the\nfeet. There is no evidence of a central jet being produced even during\npowerful synchronous kicks (maximum thrust calculated was 264 mN\nfoot–1). An alternative mechanism of force production could\nbe the lift-based paddling recently suggested for delta-shaped feet of\nswimming birds. However, the orientation of the vortex rings generated by the\nfeet is almost perpendicular to the swimming direction for both gaits and\nthere is only a slight asynchrony of the shedding of the distal (start) and\nproximal (stop) vortex rings, which is different from what would be expected\nby a dominantly lift-based mechanism. Thus, our results do not support lift as\na major mechanism contributing to thrust. Instead, our data support the\nhypothesis that propulsion is based on drag and acceleration reaction forces\nwhere the thrust is generated by separated, but attached, vortex rings on the\nsuction side of the feet, resulting in vortices that are shed behind the frogs\nduring both asynchronous and synchronous kicking.",

Nectarivorous birds, in particular, often spend time\nhovering, while non-nectarivorous birds do not. The cost of short flights is\nlikely therefore to differ between nectarivorous and non-nectarivorous birds\nbecause of the different energetic contributions of different flight types to\nthe behaviour. The 13C-labelled bicarbonate technique was used to\nmeasure the energy cost of short flights in the nectarivorous Palestine\nsunbird Nectarinia osea (mean mass 6.17±0.16 g, N=8)\nand the non-nectarivorous starling Sturnus vulgaris (mean mass\n70.11±1.11 g, N=9). The technique was initially calibrated in\nfive individuals for each species at temperatures ranging from 1 to 35°C,\nby comparing the isotope elimination rate to the metabolic rate measured\nsimultaneously by indirect calorimetry. The cost for short intermittent flight\nwas then measured by encouraging birds to fly between two perches at either\nend of a narrow corridor (perch distance for sunbirds, 6 m; for starlings, 5\nm), and measuring the amount of isotope eliminated during the flight. The\nisotope elimination rate was interpolated onto the calibration equation to\npredict flight cost, as a direct calibration could not be performed during\nflight. Mean energy expenditure during flight was 1.64±0.32 W in\nsunbirds, while in starlings the flight costs averaged 20.6±0.78 W.\nEnergy cost of flight relative to basal metabolic rate was substantially\ngreater in the starling than the sunbird. Phylogenetic analysis of different\nmodes of flight in these and additional species suggests that differences in\nflight behaviour may cause these elevated costs in slow flying\nnon-nectarivores such as starlings, compared to birds that are more prone to\nshort intermittent flights like the sunbirds.",

In addition,\nsimultaneous high-speed video footage enabled differences in flight kinematics\nsuch as flight speed, wing amplitude, up- and downstroke duration and wing\nbeat frequency to be examined. In 10 individuals, the primary feathers on the\nright wing were trimmed first, by 0.5 cm, and then by an additional 0.5 cm in\nsix of these individuals. In a separate `control' group (N=7),\napproximately 0.25 cm was trimmed off the primary feathers of both wings, to\nproduce the same reduction in wing span as 0.5 cm trimmed from one wing, while\nmaintaining symmetry. When birds were manipulated to become asymmetric they\nmaintained flight speed. They also increased the left wing amplitude and\ndecreased the right up- and downstroke durations to counteract the changes in\nwing shape, which meant that they had an increase in wing beat frequency. When\nthe wing area was reduced while maintaining symmetry, birds flew with slower\nflight speed. In this case wing amplitude did not change and wing upstroke\nslightly decreased, causing an increased wing beat frequency. The mean flight\ncost in the pre-manipulated birds was 1.90±0.1 W.

We investigated the production of\nthe integumentary structural colours of a damselfly – the familiar\nbluet, Enallagma civile (Coenagrionidae) – and a dragonfly–\n the common green darner, Anax junius (Aeshnidae) –\nusing fibre optic spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy\n(TEM). The reflectance spectra of both species showed discrete reflectance\npeaks of ∼30% reflectance at 475 and 460 nm, respectively. These\nstructural colours are produced by light scattering from closely packed arrays\nof spheres in the endoplasmic reticulum of box-shaped epidermal pigment cells\nunderlying the cuticle. The observed reflectance spectra do not conform to the\ninverse fourth power relationship predicted for Tyndall/Rayleigh scattering.\nTwo-dimensional (2-D) Fourier analysis of the TEM images of the\ncolour-producing arrays reveals ring-shaped distributions of Fourier power at\nintermediate spatial frequencies, documenting a quasiordered nanostructure.\nThe nanostructured Fourier power spectra falsify the assumption of spatial\nindependence of scatterers that is required for incoherent scattering. Radial\naverages of the Fourier power spectrum indicate that the spheres are\nsubstantially nanostructured at the appropriate spatial scale to produce\nvisible colours by coherent scattering. However, the spatial periodicity of\nthe arrays is apparently too large to produce the observed colour by coherent\nscattering. The nanospheres could have expanded substantially (∼50%)\nduring preparation for TEM. Alternatively, coherent light scattering could be\noccurring both from the surfaces and from structures at the centre of\nthe spheres. These arrays of colour-producing spheres within pigment cells\nhave convergently evolved at least 11–14 times independently within the\nOdonata.

Studies of withdrawal have focused on the response to\nhead-directed or nonspecific stimuli. During withdrawal, the animal moves its\nhead back from the stimulus, often resulting in several tight bends in the\nbody. In contrast to C-start or S-start behaviors, withdrawal to a head\nstimulus generally does not involve a subsequent propulsive stage of movement.\nWe examined intraspecific diversity in withdrawal behavior and muscle activity\npatterns of the rope fish, Erpetoichthys calabaricus, in response to\nstimulation of the head and the tail. In addition, we describe the anatomy of\nthe Mauthner cells and their axon caps, structures that are generally absent\nin species with a withdrawal startle. We recorded high-speed video (250 Hz)\nand electromyograms (EMGs) from 12 electrodes in the axial muscle during the\nbehavioral response. We used Bodian silver staining techniques to visualize\nMauthner cell and axon cap morphology. We found that E. calabaricus\nresponds with a withdrawal to both head and tail stimulation. Tail stimulation\nelicits a stronger kinematic and muscle activity response than head\nstimulation. While withdrawal movement generally constitutes the entire\nresponse to head stimuli, withdrawal was followed by propulsive movements when\nthe tail was stimulated, suggesting that withdrawal can both act alone and\nserve as the first stage of a propulsive startle. Unexpectedly, bilaterality\nof muscle activity was variable for responses to both head and tail stimuli.\nIn addition, we were surprised to find that E. calabaricus has a\ndistinct axon cap associated with its Mauthner cell.

Expression of the MSTN1\ntranscript in transgenic salmon was not different from that in wild-type adult\ncoho salmon muscle and brain tissue. However, expression of the MSTN2\ntranscript was less in white muscle, and greater in red muscle, from\ntransgenic fish compared to wild-type salmon of the same size.

        "abstract": "The inverted pendulum model in which the centre of mass of the body vaults\nover the stance leg in an arc represents a basic mechanism of bipedal walking.\nIs the pendulum mechanism innate, or is it learnt through walking experience?\nWe studied eight toddlers (about 1 year old) at their first unsupported steps,\n18 older children (1.3–13 years old), and ten adults. Two infants were\nalso tested repeatedly over a period of 4 months before the onset of\nindependent walking. Pendulum mechanism was quantified from the kinematics of\nthe greater trochanter, correlation between kinetic and gravitational\npotential energy of the centre of body mass obtained from the force plate\nrecordings, and percentage of recovery of mechanical energy. In toddlers,\nthese parameters deviated significantly (P<10–5)\nfrom those of older children and adults, indicating that the pendulum\nmechanism is not implemented at the onset of unsupported locomotion.\nNormalising the speed with the Froude number showed that the percentage of\nrecovery of mechanical energy in children older than 2 years was roughly\nsimilar to that of the adults (less than 5% difference), in agreement with\nprevious results. By contrast, the percentage of recovery in toddlers was much\nlower (by about 50%). Pendulum-like behaviour and fixed coupling of the\nangular motion of the lower limb segments rapidly co-evolved toward mature\nvalues within a few months of independent walking experience. Independent\nwalking experience acts as a functional trigger of the developmental changes,\nas shown by the observation that gait parameters remained unchanged until the\nage of the first unsupported steps, and then rapidly matured after that age.\nThe findings suggest that the pendulum mechanism is not an inevitable\nmechanical consequence of a system of linked segments, but requires active\nneural control and an appropriate pattern of inter-segmental coordination.",

        "abstract": "Teleost fish possess discrete blocks of oxidative red muscle (RM) and\nglycolytic white muscle, whereas tetrapod skeletal muscles are mixed\noxidative/glycolytic. It has been suggested that the anatomy of RM in teleost\nfish could lead to higher intramuscular O2 partial pressures\n(PO2) than in mammalian skeletal muscles. This\nstudy provides the first direct experimental support for this suggestion by\nusing novel optical fibre sensors to discover a mean (±\ns.e.m., N=6) normoxic steady-state\nred muscle PO2\n(PrmO2) of 61±10 mmHg (1\nmmHg=133.3 Pa) in free-swimming rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss.\nThis is significantly higher than literature reports for mammalian muscles,\nwhere the PO2 never exceeds 40 mmHg. Aerobic RM\npowers sustained swimming in rainbow trout. During graded incremental\nexercise, PrmO2 declined from\n62±5 mmHg at the lowest swim speed down to 45±3 mmHg at maximum\nrates of aerobic work, but then rose again to 51±5 mmHg at exhaustion.\nThese measurements of PrmO2 during\nexercise indicated, therefore, that O2 supply to the RM was not a\nmajor limiting factor at exhaustion in trout. The current study found no\nevidence that teleost haemoglobins with a Root effect cause extremely elevated\nO2 tensions in aerobic tissues. Under normoxic conditions,\nPrmO2 was significantly lower than\narterial PO2 (119±5 mmHg), and remained\nlower when the arterial to tissue PO2 gradient\nwas reduced by exposure to mild hypoxia. When two sequential levels of mild\nhypoxia (30 min at a water PO2 of 100 mmHg then\n30 min at 75 mmHg) caused PaO2 to fall to\n84±2 mmHg then 61±3 mmHg, respectively, this elicited\nsimultaneous reductions in PrmO2, to\n51±6 mmHg then 41±5 mmHg, respectively. Although these hypoxic\nreductions in PrmO2 were\nsignificantly smaller than those in PaO2, the effect could\nbe attributed to the sigmoid shape of the trout\nhaemoglobin–O2 dissociation curve.",

The spatial\narrangement of the nasal passage and sinus air spaces to the auditory bullae\nand phonic lips was studied in two dolphins via CT. Air volume of the\nsinuses and nasal passages ranged from 267.4 to 380.9 ml. Relationships of air\nspaces to the auditory bullae and phonic lips support previous hypotheses that\nair protects the ears from echolocation clicks generated by the dolphin and\ncontributes to dolphin hearing capabilities (e.g. minimum angular resolution,\ninter-aural intensity differences). Lung air may replenish reductions in sinus\nand nasal passage air volume via the palatopharyngeal sphincter, thus\npermitting the echolocation mechanism to operate at depth. To determine the\nrelative extent of regional blood flow within the head of the dolphin, two\ndolphins were scanned with SPECT after an intravenous dose of 1850 MBq\n99mTc-bicisate. A single dolphin received 740 MBq of\n18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) to identify the relative\nmetabolic activity of head tissues. Substantial blood flow was noted across\nthe dorsoanterior curvature of the melon and within the posterior region of\nthe lower jaw fats. Metabolism of these tissues relative to others within the\nhead was nominal. It is suggested that blood flow in these fat bodies serves\nto thermoregulate lipid density of the melon and jaw canal. Sound velocity is\ninversely related to the temperature of acoustic lipids (decreasing lipid\ndensity), and changes in lipid temperature are likely to impact the wave guide\nproperties of the sound projection and reception pathways. Thermoregulation of\nlipid density may maintain sound velocity gradients of the acoustic lipid\ncomplexes, particularly in the outer shell of the melon, which otherwise might\nvary in response to changing environmental temperatures.",

        "abstract": "Some organisms that survive in environments rich in hydrogen sulfide\npossess specific metabolic pathways for sulfide oxidation and subsequent use\nof reducing equivalents in oxidative phosphorylation, a process called\nchemolithoheterotrophy. This process is dependent on ambient oxygen partial\npressure and environmental sulfide exposure. To define accurately the kinetics\nof sulfide metabolism and its dependence on cellular conditions, we have\ndeveloped a polarographic sulfide sensor (PSS) to measure sulfide\nconcentrations directly and continuously under physiological conditions.The ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa, an inhabitant of sulfide-rich\ncoastal sediments, consumes sulfide in a chemolithoheterotrophic metabolic\nstrategy. Gill mitochondria use sulfide as respiratory substrate for ATP\nproduction, and sulfide consumption is sufficiently rapid and so kinetically\ncomplex that only continuous real-time detection captures these events. Under\nnormoxic conditions, oxygen and sulfide consumption are matched. Under hypoxic\nto anoxic conditions, however, sulfide consumption continues without\ncommensurate oxygen consumption, and these results can be duplicated at higher\noxygen conditions by selective blockade of terminal oxidases. These metabolic\ncapabilities depend on prior environmental sulfide exposure, which suggests\nsubstantial mitochondrial metabolic plasticity. The recent finding that\nendogenous sulfide is a critical cell signaling molecule in all organisms\nsuggests that the metabolic pathways that tightly control cellular sulfide\nlevels are widespread. Sensors that accurately report sulfide concentrations\nunder physiologically relevant conditions are valuable tools with which to\nexplore the expanding role of sulfide in biological systems.",

The Manduca CAPA gene is 958 nucleotides long with 29\nuntranslated nucleotides from the beginning of the sequence to the putative\nstart initiation site. The CAPA gene has a single open reading frame,\n441 nucleotides long, that codes for a predicted precursor protein of 147\namino acids.

The position of the tip of\nthe antenna (flagellum) is controlled by two mobile joints at its base (the\nscape and the pedicel) and by the neck. Horizontal and vertical components of\nmovement at the antennal basal joints exhibited rhythmic activities during\nlocomotory (walking) and non-locomotory (pausing) states in the searching\nanimal. In both states, the horizontal component was slower than vertical one.\nJoint-manipulation experiments suggested that the faster vertical component is\ndue mainly to movements of the scape–pedicel joint, while the slower\nhorizontal component may originate from the head–scape joint. Large\nhorizontal deflections of the antenna corresponded consistently with the yaw\ncomponent of head movement. The trajectories of the antennae showed little\npatterned regularity in most animals. In a few cases, however, loop-like\npatterns appeared. The area scanned by an antenna was narrower in the walking\nstate than in the pausing state, mainly because of a decrease in the\nhorizontal angular range. Cross-correlation analyses revealed that the\ncoupling between right and left horizontal antennal motor systems and that for\nthe vertical systems were both significantly stronger in the walking state\nthan during pausing. These results indicate that the spatio-temporal pattern\nof antennal movements changes dynamically depending on the animal's behavioral\nstate.",
