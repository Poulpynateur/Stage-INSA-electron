[{"abstract":"A recent study demonstrated that in response to a feeding-induced metabolic acidosis, goldfish Carassius auratus adjust epithelial protein and/or mRNA expression in their kidney tubules for multiple transporters known to be relevant for acid-base regulation. These include Na+/H+-exchanger, V-H+-ATPase, cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase, HCO3−-transporters, and Rhesus proteins. Consequently, renal acid output in the form of protons and NH4+ increases. Little, however, is known about mechanistic details of renal acid-base regulation in C. auratus and teleost fishes in general. The present study applied the Scanning Ion-selective Electrode Technique (SIET) to measure proton flux in proximal, distal and connecting tubules of goldfish. We detected increased H+ efflux into the extracellular fluid from the tubule in fed animals, resulting from paracellular back-flux of H+ through the tight junction. By applying inhibitors for selected acid-base regulatory epithelial transporters, we found that cytosolic carbonic anhydrase and HCO3− transporters were important in mediating H+ flux in all three tubule segments of fed goldfish. Contrastingly, V-H+-ATPase seemed to play a role for H+ flux only in proximal and distal tubule, and Na+/H+-exchanger in proximal and connecting tubule. We develop working models for transport of acid-base relevant equivalents (H+, HCO3−, NH3/NH4+) for each tubule segment in C. auratus kidney. While the proximal tubule appears to play a major role in both H+ secretion and HCO3− reabsorption, the distal and connecting tubules seem to mainly serve for HCO3− reabsorption and NH3/NH4+ secretion.","keywords":"Freshwater teleost, Renal epithelium, Acidosis, SIET","title":"Section-specific H+ fluxes in renal tubules of fasted and fed goldfish","authors":"Sandra Fehsenfeld, Dennis Kolosov, Chris M.

Animals need to discriminate objects against a visually noisy background. However, the ability to detect spatial information is limited by eye size. In insects, as individuals become smaller, the space available for the eyes reduces, which affects the number of ommatidia, the size of the lens and the downstream information processing capabilities. The evolution of small body size in a lineage, known as miniaturisation, is common in insects. Here, using pattern electroretinography with vertical sinusoidal gratings as stimuli, we studied how miniaturisation affects spatial resolving power and contrast sensitivity in four diurnal ants that live in a similar environment but varied in their body and eye size. We found that ants with fewer and smaller ommatidial facets had lower spatial resolving power and contrast sensitivity. The spatial resolving power was maximum in the largest ant Myrmecia tarsata at 0.60 cycles per degree (cpd) compared to the ant with smallest eyes Rhytidoponera inornata that had 0.48 cpd. Maximum contrast sensitivity (minimum contrast threshold) in M. tarsata (2627 facets) was 15.51 (6.4% contrast detection threshold) at 0.1 cpd, while the smallest ant R. inornata (227 facets) had a maximum contrast sensitivity of 1.34 (74.1% contrast detection threshold) at 0.05 cpd. This is the first study to physiologically investigate contrast sensitivity in the context of insect allometry. Miniaturisation thus dramatically decreases maximum contrast sensitivity and also reduces spatial resolution, which could have implications for visually guided behaviours.","keywords":"Pattern electroretinogram, Contrast sensitivity, Spatial resolution, Compound eye, Acuity, Lamina","title":"Miniaturisation reduces contrast sensitivity and spatial resolving power in ants","authors":"Ravindra Palavalli-Nettimi, Yuri Ogawa, Laura A.

Seasonal life history polyphenisms are common and include faster growth and development under direct development than diapause. However, the physiological underpinnings of this difference remain poorly known despite its significance for understanding the evolution of polyphenisms. We measured respiration and metabolic rates through the penultimate and final larval instars in the butterfly Pieris napi and show that directly developing larvae grew and developed faster and had a higher metabolic rate than larvae entering pupal diapause. The metabolic divergence appeared only in the final instar, that is, after the induction of developmental pathway that takes place in the penultimate instar in P. napi. The accumulation of fat reserves during the final larval instar was similar under diapause and direct development, which was unexpected as diapause is predicted to select for exaggerated reserve accumulation. This suggests that overwinter survival in diapause does not require larger energy reserves than direct development, likely because of metabolic suppression in diapause pupae. The results, nevertheless, demonstrate that physiological changes coincide with the divergence of life histories between the alternative developmental pathways, thus elucidating the proximate basis of seasonal life history polyphenisms.","keywords":"Allometry, Diapause, Direct development, Fat reserve, Life history, Metabolic rate, Polyphenism","title":"Developmental plasticity in metabolism but not in energy reserve accumulation in a seasonally polyphenic butterfly","authors":"Sami M.

Euryhaline elasmobranchs maintain high internal urea and ion levels even in FW environments, but little is known about the osmoregulatory mechanisms that enable them to maintain internal homeostasis in hypoosmotic environments. In the present study, we focused on the kidney because this is the only organ that can excrete excess water from the body in a hypoosmotic environment. We conducted a transfer experiment of bull sharks from SW to FW and performed differential gene expression analysis between the two conditions using RNA-seq. A search for genes up-regulated in the FW-acclimated bull shark kidney indicated that the expression of the Na+-Cl− cotransporter (NCC; Slc12a3) was ten times higher in the FW-acclimated fish compared to that in SW fish. In the kidney, apically-located NCC was observed in the late distal tubule and in the anterior half of collecting tubule where basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase was also expressed, implying that these segments contribute to NaCl reabsorption from the filtrate for diluting the urine. This expression pattern was not observed in the houndshark, Triakis scyllium, that had been transferred to 30% SW; this species cannot survive in FW environment. The salinity transfer experiment combined with a comprehensive gene screening approach demonstrates that NCC is a key renal protein that contributes to the remarkable euryhaline ability of the bull shark.","keywords":"Kidney, Ion transporters, Euryhalinity, Osmoregulation, Freshwater adaptation, Cartilaginous fish","title":"Comprehensive analysis of genes contributing to euryhalinity in the bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas; Na+-Cl− co-transporter is one of the key renal factors up-regulated in acclimation to low-salinity environment in bull sharks, but not in houndsharks, Triakis scyllium","authors":"Itaru Imaseki, Midori Wakabayashi, Yuichiro Hara, Taro Watanabe, Souichirou Takabe, Keigo Kakumura, Yuki Honda, Keiichi Ueda, Kiyomi Murakumo, Rui Matsumoto, Yosuke Matsumoto, Masaru Nakamura, Wataru Takagi, Shigehiro Kuraku, Susumu Hyodo","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"28 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.201780v1?rss=1"},{"abstract":"Poison frogs sequester small molecule lipophilic alkaloids from their diet of leaf litter arthropods for use as chemical defenses against predation. Although the dietary acquisition of chemical defenses in poison frogs is well-documented, the physiological mechanisms of alkaloid sequestration has not been investigated. Here, we used RNA sequencing and proteomics to determine how alkaloids impact mRNA or protein abundance in the Little Devil Frog (Oophaga sylvatica) and compared wild caught chemically defended frogs to laboratory frogs raised on an alkaloid-free diet. To understand how poison frogs move alkaloids from their diet to their skin granular glands, we focused on measuring gene expression in the intestines, skin, and liver. Across these tissues, we found many differentially expressed transcripts involved in small molecule transport and metabolism, as well as sodium channels and other ion pumps. We then used proteomic approaches to quantify plasma proteins, where we found several protein abundance differences between wild and laboratory frogs, including the amphibian neurotoxin binding protein saxiphilin. Finally, because many blood proteins are synthesized in the liver, we used thermal proteome profiling as an untargeted screen for soluble proteins that bind the alkaloid decahydroquinoline. Using this approach, we identified several candidate proteins that interact with this alkaloid, including saxiphilin. These transcript and protein abundance patterns suggest the presence of alkaloids influences frog physiology and that small molecule transport proteins may be involved in toxin bioaccumulation in dendrobatid poison frogs.","keywords":"Alkaloids, Sequestration, Chemical defense, Poison frogs, Dendrobatidae, RNA sequencing, Proteomics, Plasma","title":"Molecular physiology of chemical defenses in a poison frog","authors":"Stephanie N.

However, changes in form of short-term parasite effects on host physiological markers have generally been overlooked in favor of fitness measures. Here we studied flea (Oropsylla idahoensis and Oropsylla opisocroistis tuberculata) parasitism on a natural population of Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus; CGS) in Sheep River Provincial Park, Alberta. Fleas were experimentally added to adult female CGS at physiologically demanding times, including birth, lactation, and weaning of their young. The body mass of adult females, as well as their oxidative stress and immunity were recorded multiple times over the CGS active season under flea-augmented and control conditions. We also measured the prevalence of an internal parasite (Trypanosoma otospermophili). Doubly labelled water (DLW) was interperitoneally injected at peak lactation to examine energy expenditure. Effects of parasites on oxidative stress were only observed after offspring were weaned. There was no direct effect of experimentally heightened flea prevalence on energy use. A short-term 24 h mass loss (-17 g) was detected briefly after parasite addition, likely due to CGS preferentially allocating time for grooming. Our parasite augmentation did not strongly affect hosts and suggested that short-term physiological effects were unlikely to culminate in long term fitness consequences. Columbian ground squirrels appear to rapidly manage parasite costs, probably through grooming.","keywords":"Parasitism, Immune cost, Columbian ground squirrel, Flea, Energy expenditure, Oxidative stress","title":"Subtle short-term physiological costs of an experimental augmentation of fleas in wild Columbian ground squirrels","authors":"Jeffrey D.

The fitness benefits provided by these cognitive skills, in conjunction with social behaviours, contributes to the success of social insects. How these abilities are shared among the different castes and the long-term persistence of memory are now being elucidated in diverse systems, work that should shed light on general principles underlying cognitive evolution. Here we provide the first evidence of olfactory learning and long-term olfactory memory in all three castes of an Asian hornet, Vespa velutina. Using the first proboscis extension reflex assay developed for hornets or wasps, we found that all hornet castes could learn and remember odours associated with a food reward. Moreover, long-lasting memory was retained without significant decay in gynes (virgin queens) and drones even up to 30 d. Workers did not survive for 30 d. Drones learned and remembered simple odorant molecules and gyne sex pheromone with equal facility. These results increase our understanding of the outstanding cognitive abilities of social insects and suggest the likely importance of long-lasting memory in different castes of the same species.","keywords":"Wasp, Vespa velutina, Vespa velutina, Caste, Cognition, Olfactory learning, Memory","title":"Hornets possess long-lasting olfactory memories","authors":"Zhiwen Gong, Ken Tan, James C.

We hypothesized that context-dependent shifts in the nervous system associated with behavior may also be linked to changes in TF-target relationships over physiological timescales. We tested this hypothesis using honey bee (Apis mellifera) division of labor as a model system by performing bioinformatic analyses of previously published brain transcriptomic profiles together with new RNAi and behavioral experiments. The bioinformatic analyses identified five TFs that exhibited strong signatures of regulatory plasticity as a function of division of labor. RNAi targeting one of these TFs (broad complex) and a related TF that did not exhibit plasticity (fushi-tarazu transcription factor 1) was administered in conjunction with automated analyses of foraging behavior in the field, laboratory assays of aggression and brood care behavior, and endocrine treatments. Results showed that changes in regulatory relationships of these TFs were associated with behavioral state, social context and endocrine state. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that TF-target relationships in the brain are altered in conjunction with behavior and social context. They also suggest that one mechanism for this plasticity involves pleiotropic TFs high in regulatory hierarchies producing behavior-specific transcriptional responses by activating different downstream TFs, to induce discrete context-dependent transcriptional cascades. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic nature of the transcriptional regulatory architecture underlying behavior in the brain.","keywords":"Division of labor, Gene regulatory networks, Honey bee, Social behavior, Transcriptomic plasticity","title":"Division of labor in honey bees is associated with transcriptional regulatory plasticity in the brain","authors":"Adam R.

We determined the maximal load carrying capacity of leaf-cutter ants by incrementally adding mass to the leaves they carried. Maximal load carrying ability scaled isometrically with body size, indicating that larger ants had the capacity to lift the same proportion of their body mass as smaller ants (8.78 * body mass). However, larger ants were captured carrying leaf fragments that represented a lower proportion of their body mass compared to their smaller counterparts. Therefore, when selecting leaves, larger ants retained a higher proportion of their load carrying capacity in reserve. This suggests that either larger ants require greater power reserves to overcome challenges they encounter along the trail, or leaf-cutter ants do not select loads that maximize the overall leaf transport rate of the colony.","keywords":"Leaf-cutter ants, Load carrying, Biomechanics, Atta cephalotes, Atta cephalotes","title":"Large ants don't carry their fair share: Maximal load carrying performance of leaf-cutter ants (Atta cephalotes)","authors":"P.

However, ITD are in the sub-millisecond range for most animals. Because the neural processing of such small ITDs pushes the limit of temporal resolution, the precise ITD-range for a given species and its usefulness - relative to other localization cues - was a powerful selective force in the evolution of the neural circuits involved. Birds and other non-mammals have internally coupled middle ears working as pressure-difference receivers that may significantly enhance ITD, depending on the precise properties of the interaural connection. Here, the extent of this internal coupling was investigated in chickens, specifically under the same experimental conditions as typically used in neurophysiology of ITD-coding circuits, i.e. with headphone stimulation and skull openings. Cochlear microphonics (CM) were recorded simultaneously from both ears of anesthetized chickens under monaural and binaural stimulation, using pure tones from 0.1 to 3 kHz. Interaural transmission peaked at 1.5 kHz at a loss of only −5.5 dB; the mean interaural delay was 264 µs. CM amplitude strongly modulated as a function of ITD, confirming significant interaural coupling. The “ITD heard” derived from the CM phases in both ears showed enhancement, compared to the acoustic stimuli, by a factor of up to 1.8. However, the experimental conditions impaired interaural transmission at low frequencies (< 1 kHz). We identify factors that need to be considered when interpreting neurophysiological data obtained under these conditions, and relating them to the natural free-field condition.","keywords":"Auditory, Hearing, Sound localization, Bird, Avian, ITD","title":"Internally coupled middle ears enhance the range of interaural time differences heard by the chicken","authors":"Christine Köppl","origin":"Research Article","pub_date":"28 May 2019","link":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/jeb.199232v1?rss=1"}]
