[{"title":"Self-supervised learning of the biologically-inspired obstacle avoidance of hexapod walking robot","authors":"Petr Čížek, Jan Faigl","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"3 May 2019","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an integrated biologically inspired visual collision avoidance approach that is deployed on a real hexapod walking robot. The proposed approach is based on the Lobula giant movement detector (LGMD), a neural network for looming stimuli detection that can be found in visual pathways of insects, such as locusts. Although a superior performance of the LGMD in the detection of intercepting objects has been shown in many collision avoiding scenarios, its direct integration with motion control is an unexplored topic. In our work, we propose to utilize the LGMD neural network for visual interception detection with a central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion control of a hexapod walking robot that are combined in the controller based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. Moreover, we propose self-supervised learning of the integrated controller to autonomously find a suitable setting of the system using a realistic robotic simulator. Thus, individual neural networks are trained in a simulation to enhance the performance of the controller that is then experimentally verified with a real hexapod walking robot in both collision and interception avoidance scenario and navigation in a cluttered environment.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046002"},{"title":"Flow field perception based on the fish lateral line system","authors":"Yonggang Jiang, Zhiqiang Ma, Deyuan Zhang","origin":"Topical Review","pub_date":"3 May 2019","abstract":"Fish are able to perceive the surrounding weak flow and pressure variations with their mechanosensory lateral line system, which consists of a superficial lateral line for flow velocity detection and a canal lateral line for flow pressure gradient perception. Achieving a better understanding of the flow field perception algorithms of the lateral line can contribute not only to the design of highly sensitive flow sensors, but also to the development of underwater smart skin with good hydrodynamic imaging properties. In this review, we discuss highly sensitive flow-sensing mechanisms for superficial and canal neuromasts and flow field perception algorithms. Artificial lateral line systems with different transduction mechanisms are then described with special emphasis on the recent innovations in the field of polymer-based artificial flow sensors. Finally, we discuss our perspective of the technological challenges faced while improving flow sensitivity, durability, and sensing fusion schemes.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/041001"},{"title":"Bottom-level motion control for robotic fish to swim in groups: modeling and experiments","authors":"Liang Li, Anquan Liu, Wei Wang, Sridhar Ravi, Rubin Fu, Junzhi Yu, Guangming Xie","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"2 May 2019","abstract":"Moving in groups is an amazing spectacle of collective behaviour in fish and has attracted considerable interest from many fields, including biology, physics and engineering. Although robotic fish have been well studied, including algorithms to simulate group swimming, experiments that demonstrate multiple robotic fish as a stable group are yet to be achieved. One of the challenges is the lack of a robust bottom-level motion control system for robotic fish platforms. Here we seek to overcome this challenge by focusing on the design and implementation of a motion controller for robotic fish that allows multiple individuals to swim in groups. As direction control is essential in motion control, we first propose a high-accuracy controller which can control a sub-carangiform robotic fish from one arbitrary position/pose (position and direction) to another. We then develop a hydrodynamic-model-based simulation platform to expedite the process of the parameter tuning of the controller. The accuracy of the simulation platform was assessed by comparing the results from experiments on a robotic fish using speeding and turning tests. Subsequently, extensive simulations and experiments with robotic fish were used to verify the accuracy and robustness of the bottom-level motion control. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our controller by implementing group swimming using three robotic fish swimming freely in prescribed trajectories. Although the fluid environment can be complex during group swimming, our bottom-level motion control remained nominally accurate and robust. This motion control strategy lays a solid foundation for further studies of group swimming with multiple robotic fish.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/4/046001"},{"title":"Canal neuromasts enhance foraging in zebrafish (Danio rerio)","authors":"Andres Carrillo, Dan Van Le, Margaret Byron, Houshuo Jiang, Matthew J McHenry","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"10 April 2019","abstract":"Aquatic animals commonly sense flow using superficial neuromasts (SNs), which are receptors that extend from the body's surface. The lateral line of fishes is unique among these systems because it additionally possesses receptors, the canal neuromasts (CNs), that are recessed within a channel. The lateral line has inspired the development of engineered sensors and concepts in the analysis of flow fields for submersible navigation. The biophysics of CNs are known to be different from the SNs and thereby offer a distinct submodality. However, it is generally unclear whether CNs play a distinct role in behavior. We therefore tested whether CNs enhance foraging in the dark by zebrafish (Danio rerio), a behavior that we elicited with a vibrating rod. We found that juvenile fish, which have only SNs, bite at this rod at about one-third the rate and from as little as one-third the distance of adults for a high-frequency stimulus (50  <  f   <  100 Hz). We used novel techniques for manipulating the lateral line in adults to find that CNs offered only a modest benefit at a lower frequency (20 Hz) and that foraging was mediated entirely by cranial neuromasts. Consistent with our behavioral results, biophysical models predicted CNs to be more than an order of magnitude more sensitive than SNs at high frequencies. This enhancement helps to overcome the rapid spatial decay in high-frequency components in the flow around the stimulus. These findings contrast what has been previously established for fishes that are at least ten-times the length of zebrafish, which use trunk CNs to localize prey. Therefore, CNs generally enhance foraging, but in a manner that varies with the size of the fish and its prey. These results have the potential to improve our understanding of flow sensing in aquatic animals and engineered systems.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/035003"},{"title":"Fluid-structure interaction modeling on a 3D ray-strengthened caudal fin","authors":"Guangyu Shi, Qing Xiao, Qiang Zhu, Wei Liao","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"10 April 2019","abstract":"In this paper, we present a numerical model capable of solving the fluid-structure interaction problems involved in the dynamics of skeleton-reinforced fish fins. In this model, the fluid dynamics is simulated by solving the Navier–Stokes equations using a finite-volume method based on an overset, multi-block structured grid system. The bony rays embedded in the fin are modeled as nonlinear Euler–Bernoulli beams. To demonstrate the capability of this model, we numerically investigate the effect of various ray stiffness distributions on the deformation and propulsion performance of a 3D caudal fin. Our numerical results show that with specific ray stiffness distributions, certain caudal fin deformation patterns observed in real fish (e.g. the cupping deformation) can be reproduced through passive structural deformations. Among the four different stiffness distributions (uniform, cupping, W-shape and heterocercal) considered here, we find that the cupping distribution requires the least power expenditure. The uniform distribution, on the other hand, performs the best in terms of thrust generation and efficiency. The uniform stiffness distribution, per se, also leads to 'cupping' deformation patterns with relatively smaller phase differences between various rays. The present model paves the way for future work on dynamics of skeleton-reinforced membranes.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/036012"},{"title":"Emergence of behavior through morphology: a case study on an octopus inspired manipulator","authors":"Thomas George Thuruthel, Egidio Falotico, Federico Renda, Tamar Flash, Cecilia Laschi","origin":"Note","pub_date":"24 April 2019","abstract":"The complex motion abilities of the Octopus vulgaris have been an intriguing research topic for biologists and roboticists alike. Various studies have been conducted on the underlying control architectures employed by these high dimensional biological organisms. Researchers have attempted to replicate these architectures on robotic systems. Contrary to previous approaches, this study focuses on a robotic system, which is only morphologically similar to the Octopus vulgaris, and how it would behave under different control policies. This sheds light on the underlying optimality principles that these biological systems employ. Open loop control policies are obtained through a trajectory optimization method on a learned forward dynamic model. The motion patterns emerging from variations in morphology and environment were then derived to study the role of the body and environment. Results show that for the specific case of dynamic reaching with a soft appendage, the invariance in motion profile is a fundamental constraint imposed by the morphology and environment, independent from the controller. This suggests how morphological design can simplify stable control even for highly dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems and can provide insights into design of new soft robotic mechanisms.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/034001"},{"title":"Learning bioinspired joint geometry from motion capture data of bat flight","authors":"Matthew Bender, Jia Guo, Nathan Powell, Andrew Kurdila, Rolf Müller","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"10 April 2019","abstract":"Bioinspired robotic systems are often designed by assuming that the kinematics of the biological system of interest are well approximated by an open kinematic chain subject to box constraints. These box-constrains are typically generated by designer interpretation of biomotion and anatomical studies or pragmatic fabrication constraints. In contrast to this standard design paradigm, this paper presents a methodology for learning joint geometry which restricts the range of motion of generic ball joints to only the reachable set observed during biomotion experiments. This reachable set is identified by constructing an analytical-empirical potential energy function over the experimental observations. The energy function effectively 'pushes' configurations close to the set of observations. This energy function is then thresholded to identify the zero-potential (ZP) configuration set, and joint geometry is constructed using the resulting contour. We construct an entire bat wing using this method, and demonstrate through motion capture experiments that the learned geometry successfully restricts motions to the ZP set.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/036013"},{"title":"Random sequential addition simulations of animal aggregations provide null models of group structure","authors":"Daniel Olsen, David W Murphy","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"8 April 2019","abstract":"Apparent structure in animal aggregations such as fish and Antarctic krill schools may result from the tight packing of these elongated animals. This geometrical structure may be difficult to differentiate from behavior-induced structure resulting from individuals preferentially taking up certain positions relative to conspecifics to gain an adaptive advantage such as reduced locomotive cost. Here we use random sequential addition (RSA) simulations to quantify the effect of animal shape, aggregation organization, and aggregation density on 2D school structure. This technique allows for the generation of a null model for nearest neighbor distance and nearest neighbor position angle for a specific body shape and aggregation density, thus isolating the effect of geometry from that of behavior. We further identify a shape-specific aggregation density threshold above which the animal shape affects the spatial distribution of nearest neighbors. Nearest neighbor distance data of fish schools with densities above and below the threshold are found to agree well with nearest neighbor statistics found from RSA-generated schools.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/035001"},{"title":"A bio-inspired electric camera for short-range object inspection in murky waters","authors":"Martin Gottwald, Hendrik Herzog, Gerhard von der Emde","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"8 April 2019","abstract":"Underwater object inspection by optical sensors is usually unreliable in turbid or dark environments. Here, we designed a biomimetic 'electric camera', inspired by weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii, which successfully use active electrolocation for this task. The device probed nearby objects with a weak electric field and captured 'electric images' of the targets by processing the object-evoked field modulations. The camera-based electric images strongly resembled those available to G. petersii. Furthermore, by extracting the fish's analytical cues from these images, close objects could be reliably analysed. Based on the level of 'image blurring' short distances of electrolocation targets, spheres of different sizes and material were estimated. Natural targets, fish or plants, were identified irrespective of their size or distance by their two individual 'electric colours' derived from electric images. Furthermore, we introduce an image cue, called the 'electric outline', which provided information resembling a target's optical contour. Our results indicate that bio-inspired electric imaging principles provide promising cues for sensor-based, short-range object inspections in murky waters. By resembling the electric imaging applied by G. petersii our device can also be used for 'reverse biomimetics', revealing imaging cues that so far have not been considered for weakly electric fish.","link":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-3190/14/3/035002"},{"title":"Musculoskeletal design, control, and application of human mimetic humanoid Kenshiro","authors":"Yuki Asano, Kei Okada, Masayuki Inaba","origin":"Paper","pub_date":"8 April 2019","abstract":"We have been developing a human mimetic musculoskeletal humanoid called Kenshiro, whose design concept is to thoroughly pursue an unprecedented anatomical fidelity to the human musculoskeletal structure.
