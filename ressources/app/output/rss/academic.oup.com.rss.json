[{"origin":"Crop Molecular Genetics","abstract":"Despite conservation of the process of meiosis, recombination landscapes vary between species, with large genome grasses such as barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) exhibiting a pattern of recombination that is very heavily skewed to the ends of chromosomes. We have been using a collection of semi-sterile desynaptic meiotic mutant lines to help elucidate how recombination is controlled in barley and the role of the corresponding wild-type (WT) meiotic genes within this process. Here we applied a combination of genetic segregation analysis, cytogenetics, and immunocytology to genetically map and characterize the meiotic mutant desynaptic5 (des5). We identified an exonic insertion in the positional candidate ortholog of Disrupted Meiotic cDNA 1 (HvDMC1) on chromosome 5H of des5. des5 exhibits a severe meiotic phenotype with disturbed synapsis, reduced crossovers, and chromosome mis-segregation. The meiotic phenotype and reduced fertility of des5 is similarly observed in Hvdmc1RNAi transgenic plants and HvDMC1p:GusPlus reporter lines show DMC1 expression specifically in the developing inflorescence. The des5 mutation maintains the reading frame of the gene and exhibits semi-dominance with respect to recombination in the heterozygote indicating the value of non-knockout mutations for dissection of the control of recombination in the early stages of meiosis.","authors":"Isabelle Colas, Abdellah Barakate, Malcolm Macaulay, Miriam Schreiber, Jennifer Stephens, Sebastian Vivera, Claire Halpin, Robbie Waugh, Luke Ramsay","keywords":"Barley, crossover, desynaptic, DMC1, immunocytology, meiosis, recombination, RNAi","pub_date":"27 April 2019","title":"desynaptic5 carries a spontaneous semi-dominant mutation affecting Disrupted Meiotic cDNA 1 in barley","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/10/2683/5480917?rss=1"},{"origin":"Insight","abstract":"Proteins are involved in shaping the plant phenotype in response to environmental cues. However, in order to make use of proteomic studies in modern breeding programmes, dissection of genotype×environment (G×E) effects on the relative abundance of different proteins is essential. This can be achieved through pQTL mapping but a prerequisite has been laborious analysis of alterations in the relative abundance of protein spots in very large 2-DE gel sets. New research by Rodziewicz et al. (2019) showing a streamlined process is invaluable and should allow an accelerated application of proteomic data leading to improved drought-resistant varieties., Abiotic stresses including drought, salinity and extreme temperature are major environmental factors adversely affecting plant growth and development. The plant response is determined by genotype×environment (G×E) interactions which affect a wide range of quantitative traits from growth, development and yield characteristics to transcript, protein and metabolite abundance. Proteins are directly involved in shaping the plant phenotype with either structural or regulatory functions related to formation of the plant epigenome, transcriptome and metabolome. These functions are determined not only by the corresponding (maternal) gene sequence but also by posttranscriptional and posttranslational modifications resulting in different protein isoforms, cellular localization and interaction networks (Kosová et al., 2018). Hence studies aimed not just at a description of the proteome, but also at functional characterization with respect to phenotypic variability, are becoming increasingly important., Recently, studies in plants have shown that qualitative or quantitative changes which some marker proteins undergo in response to stress reveal a correlation with the degree of stress tolerance. As an example, our studies on Kn-type dehydrins reveal a correlation between the relative abundance of the proteins and acquired frost tolerance expressed as the lethal temperature for 50% of the sample (LT50) in winter wheat and barley cultivars subjected to cold acclimation treatment (Kosová et al., 2008, 2013; Vítámvás et al., 2010, 2019). However, as with other quantitative traits, the quantitative changes in relative abundance of marker proteins are determined by G×E interactions which limit their application in breeding programmes. Dissection of these effects through proteomic studies aimed at pQTL mapping is essential, and a new approach from Rodziewicz et al. (2019) is an important step forward. Their effective analysis of protein abundances in very large two-dimensional (2-DE) gel sets, essential for pQTL mapping, will help drive the development of improved drought-resistant varieties., How do different levels of environmental stress factors affect the plant? As an example, a total proteome comparison of the impacts of two levels of water deficit stress (30 and 35% soil water capacity, SWC) on crown tissues of spring barley cultivar Amulet revealed acclimation at 35% SWC but signs of damage at 30% SWC (Vítámvás et al., 2015). 35% SWC led to enhanced levels of proteins involved in key catabolic processes such as glycolysis, indicating the mobilization of energy metabolism. Stress acclimation processes reveal enhanced energy requirements due to the synthesis of a number of novel compounds. 30% SWC led to opposite patterns in some isoforms of enzymes involved in glycolysis (e.g. 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase-like), and increased levels of fermentation enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase. This indicates a shift from aerobic to less-efficient anaerobic metabolism, probably as an adaptation to avoid enhanced ROS formation., Turning to the genotype, plants can adopt various strategies to cope with water-deficit stress. For example, stomatal closure leading to a reduction of water deficit in plant tissues represents a trade-off with photosynthesis in C3 plants since it leads not only to reduced water loss but also to reduced CO2 availability for Rubisco. Accordingly two contrasting strategies can be distinguished in plants subjected to water deficit: a conservative, water-saving strategy, in which plants respond to slightly decreased water content in their cells by immediate stomatal closure thus eliminating water loss but also reducing CO2 availability to the photosynthetic apparatus; and a water-spending strategy, in which the stomata remain open until relatively severe cellular water deficit occurs. Water-spenders thus lose water but retain CO2 availability for Rubisco (Box 1; Rebetzke et al., 2002; Condon et al., 2004; Reynolds et al., 2005; Passioura, 2012). An alternative approach to resolve the trade-off between CO2 uptake and water release by stomata in C3 plants was presented by Blum (2009). Instead of a conservative water-saving strategy leading to maximized water-use efficiency (WUE), a strategy was proposed leading to maximized ‘effective use of water’ (EUW), i.e. minimizing water loss from the plant by every means except for stomatal closure., Changes in proteome composition underlie different responses to water-deficit stress, and these reveal distinct tolerance strategies. To give an example, Urban et al. (2017) provided a comparison of responses to drought in oilseed rape cultivars Cadeli and Californium (water-savers) and Navajo and Viking (water-spenders). Results of 2D-DIGE analysis showed that in the water-saver group, proteins related to nitrogen assimilation, ATP biosynthesis and redox homeostasis increased under stress. In the water-spender category, under the same conditions, proteins involved in carbohydrate/energy metabolism, photosynthesis and rRNA processing increased (together with other ‘stress-related proteins’)., In another example, Ford et al. (2011) compared three Australian wheat cultivars—Kukri, Excalibur and RAC875—exposed to cyclic drought conditions. During the initial stages of drought stress, while Excalibur lacked significant changes in proteome composition, RAC875 showed significant changes in the relative abundance of different proteins. After more prolonged stress, all three genotypes showed an increase in the abundance of proteins with chaperone (COR410) and ROS-scavenging capacity (CAT, Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD), as well as decreases in proteins involved in the aerobic processes of energy metabolism such as photosynthesis and the Calvin cycle. The cultivars also showed different protein patterns following rewatering. Less-tolerant Kukri showed significant decreases in Calvin cycle enzymes as well as proteins involved in photosynthesis and photorespiration, and increases in proteins involved in stress responses, redox homeostasis, and protein biosynthesis (translation) and folding. More-tolerant RAC875 showed decreases in proteins involved in the Calvin cycle and photorespiration, as well as several photosystem components (e.g. photosystem I subunit VII), and increases in proteins involved in amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and protein translation, degradation and folding. Tolerant Excalibur showed no large decreases in Calvin cycle enzymes but increases in eight out of 12 glycolysis or gluconeogenesis enzymes, and mixed patterns in proteins belonging to the photosynthetic machinery or involved in translation and stress responses. It is evident that different cultivars, although all relatively drought tolerant, employ different strategies to cope with stress. These can be distinguished and further analysed at proteome level., Rollins et al. (2013) compared two barley genotypes originating from arid and semi-arid regions—Australian cultivar Keel and Syrian landrace Arta—with respect to their response to drought, heat, and combined drought and heat treatments. Proteomic analysis revealed an increase in proteins involved in both protein biosynthesis and degradation (proteases), protein folding mediated by chaperones and redox homeostasis; as well as proteins involved in energy metabolism, including photosynthesis-related proteins (e.g. the thermotolerant Rubisco activase B isoform) and proteins related to anaerobic processes (glycolysis), indicating an increased need to reduce the risks of oxidative damage., In order to utilize the results of proteomic studies in modern breeding programmes, dissection of G×E effects on the relative abundance of different proteins is essential, and this can be achieved through pQTL mapping. Genetic mapping studies aim to determine QTLs underlying differences in quantitative traits within mapping populations derived from parental genotypes with contrasting values of the given phenotypic traits. Several QTLs underlying traits related to growth, development and yield have been mapped in drought-treated wheat and barley. The mapping populations were mostly derived from crosses between genotypes of different geographical origin revealing contrasting values of phenotypic traits under water-deficit conditions (reviewed in Kosová et al., 2014). By analogy with QTLs, protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) can be mapped based on differences in relative abundance of proteins in a population derived from parental genotypes with contrasting phenotypes (Box 2)., Unlike genetic mapping studies aimed at determining QTLs underlying phenotypic traits, studies aimed at determining pQTLs are scarce because of the need to evaluate quantitative changes in proteins within very large proteome sets. Nevertheless, the 2-DE technique is a good choice for pQTL mapping studies since fine but important differences in protein spot densities enable a dissection of the relative abundance of different protein isoforms. Distinct and often opposite patterns of quantitative change may be apparent in isoforms with potentially distinct biological functions., In the study by Rodziewicz et al. (2019) the authors developed an innovative approach enabling them to assess, in total, 408 sets of 2-DE gels from leaf and root samples covering 100 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from German semi-dwarf cultivar Maresi and Syrian breeding line Cam/B1/CI, i.e. genotypes revealing different drought-response strategies. Their analysis led to mapping of pQTLs underlying quantitative differences in the relative abundance of drought-responsive proteins with previously identified QTLs for yield-related traits (Mikołajczak et al., 2016, 2017). The drought-responsive proteins included betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, thioredoxin O, ATP synthase β subunit, glutamine synthetase, HSP70, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, translocase subunit secA, δ-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase and luminal binding protein; the yield-related traits included 1000-grain weight, length of main spike, number of spikelets per lateral spike, grain weight per main spike, and heading date. The authors’ effective management of laborious analyses of alterations in the relative abundance of protein spots in very large 2-DE gel sets is invaluable, and a necessary prerequisite for pQTL mapping. Such mapping associated with improved stress tolerance will enable breeders to apply proteomic data in modern breeding programmes., The work was supported by an institutional project of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (MZe) MZe-RO0419 and by projects of the Czech Ministry of Agriculture QK1710302, QK1910197 and QK1910269.","authors":"Klára Kosová, Pavel Vítámvás, Miroslav Klíma, Ilja Tom Prášil","keywords":"Abiotic stress, barley, drought, Genotype×Environment (G×E) interactions, modern breeding, pQTL, protein relative abundance, proteomics","pub_date":"09 May 2019","title":"Breeding drought-resistant crops: G×E interactions, proteomics and pQTLS","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/10/2605/5487320?rss=1"},{"origin":"Growth and Development","abstract":"In order to respond to fluctuating zinc (Zn) in the environment, plants must have a system to control Zn homeostasis.

Higher expression levels of OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP8, and OsZIP10 were found in the roots of accessions with functional OsHMA3 in response to Zn deficiency.

Activation of gene expression as a result of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-mediated assembly of Transport Inhibitor Response 1 (TIR1)/Auxin F-Box (AFB) proteins with AUX/IAA transcriptional regulators has become accepted as the canonical auxin signalling pathway. However, the evidence strongly suggests that non-canonical pathways will still prove to be important, and this theme ran through the 2018 Auxins and Cytokinins in Plant Development conference held in Prague (ACPD 2018)., There is no doubt that the canonical pathway deserves its title because most auxin-mediated phenotypes can be accounted for by TIR1/AFB-mediated ubiquitination of AUX/IAAs (Leyser, 2018). The diversity of responses to auxin is then attributed to differential gene expression brought about as a consequence of the multiplicity of AUX/IAAs, a similar multiplicity of Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) with which AUX/IAAs heterodimerize, cellular context, and the varying dose dependencies of TIR1/AFB co-receptor formation (Calderon et al., 2012) (see Box 1)., Historically, Auxin-Binding Protein1 (ABP1) offered another possible auxin signalling pathway, but the ABP1 story was foreshortened when new ABP1 knockout lines were found to have no gross phenotype (Gao et al., 2015), and subsequent publications explained why some earlier tools in ABP1 research had been misleading (Dai et al., 2015; Michalko et al., 2015). Yet there have always been observations of responses to auxin which are difficult to rationalize with the canonical pathway, such as those too rapid to be the consequence of transcription and translation (Badescu and Napier, 2006). Details of such non-canonical pathways are now appearing in abundance. Somewhat surprisingly, TIR1 remains at the heart of some of these mechanisms., Fendrych and Friml have developed a microscopy platform that allows roots to be imaged in vivo growing vertically (von Wangenheim et al., 2017a, b). A microfluidic perfusion system allows the root medium to be switched on demand (Grossmann et al., 2012), and these technical advances allowed them to record real-time images of primary roots responding to auxin by reducing elongation growth within 30 s (Fendrych et al., 2018). This is far too fast for the canonical pathway of auxin signalling. Just as remarkable is that the growth rate recovered within 2 min after removing IAA from the bathing medium, illustrating strong and rapid homeostatic control of cellular auxin concentrations. Auxin responses were induced by nanomolar IAA concentrations, with an IC50 of 1.4 nM., Given that the response was so rapid and so sensitive, it was pertinent to ask whether the site of perception was intracellular or extracellular, and so a knockout line for the auxin uptake carrier, AUX1, was used. Rapid changes in root elongation growth were shown to depend on AUX1, indicating that the auxin signal was detected inside the cells. Exactly the same conclusion was reached in work from the Hedrich lab which used root hair cells impaled with microelectrodes to demonstrate similarly rapid and AUX1-dependent changes in plasma membrane (PM) potential in response to auxin challenge (Dindas et al., 2018). Both groups went on to use single and multiple TIR1 and AFB mutant lines, showing that the responses were also dependent on TIR1/AFBs. This is remarkable because it suggests that these receptors must have a second mechanism of action, a mechanism that is very rapid and exercised at the PM (see Box 2). The canonical TIR1 pathway is certainly based within the nucleus (Wang et al., 2016) and is expected to take many minutes to complete transcription and translation, even of early auxin response genes., In addition to use of the TIR1/AFB mutant lines, Fendrych and Friml used an exciting new synthetic auxin switch based on TIR1 (Uchida et al., 2018) to confirm the requirement for this receptor in rapid root responses. This version of TIR1 has been engineered to extend the auxin-binding pocket (concave TIR1). The partner to concave TIR1 is a novel auxin (convex auxin) which has been designed to match the extended pocket, but is unable to bind to wild-type TIR1/AFBs. Thus, the synthetic convex auxin activates auxin signalling only in plants transformed to express concave TIR1, and in these lines convex auxin induces rapid inhibition of primary root extension, confirming the involvement of TIR1 in this response (Fendrych et al., 2018)., The events at the PM are initiated with a membrane depolarization, which was associated with the co-transport of protons with AUX1-mediated IAA uptake (Dindas et al., 2018). Interestingly, the depolarization pattern was found to include transient influx of Ca2+ ions, and this rise in intracellular calcium concentration may be associated with further mechanisms to drive longer and larger depolarization events. Root gravitropism in Arabidopsis requires the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 14 (CNGC14; Shih et al., 2015), and the Hedrich group confirmed that this channel protein was responsible for IAA-induced Ca2+ influx by showing that calcium influx was absent in cngc14 root hairs., It is intriguing that so many key features of rapid, TIR1-dependent non-canonical auxin signalling have been identified and yet there remain so many unanswered questions about the system. Principal amongst these are how TIR1/AFBs converse so rapidly with the PM to trigger ion fluxes, and how many elements comprise this signalling pathway. Suggestions have been made (Dindas et al., 2018; Fendrych et al., 2018; Retzer et al., 2018) and a key realization is that TIR1 and AFBs are not found exclusively in the nucleus. With our eye on canonical nuclear signalling, we have merely overlooked these proteins in the cytoplasm (Wang et al., 2016) since this population is small (Yu et al., 2015). Mutants of TIR1 have also been shown to promote dissociation of TIR1 from its Ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, and the untethered TIR1 is stabilized and accumulates (Yu et al., 2015). Whilst this was found to lead to auxin-resistant phenotypes, no rapid responses were investigated. Given that mammalian HSP90 family members are mechanistically connected to, for example, oestrogen receptor activity and migration between the cytoplasm and nucleus (Echeverria and Picard, 2010), it is also interesting that Arabidopsis TIR1 has been shown to be chaperoned by heat-shock protein 90s (HSP90s) and Suppressor of G2 allele SKP1 (SGT1; Wang et al., 2016; Watanabe et al., 2017)., Not all reports of non-canonical auxin signalling have been linked to TIR1 and the AFBs. A prominent non-canonical pathway is associated with one of the ARFs. The ARFs are a family of transcription factors which bind to Auxin Response Elements (AREs) through a conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain (Chandler, 2016; Weijers and Wagner, 2016; Leyser, 2018; Roosjen et al., 2018). These N-terminal domains also function as dimerization domains. Most ARFs also contain a conserved C-terminal Phox/Bem1p box (PB1) domain which is responsible for binding AUX/IAA proteins in the canonical auxin pathway. One variant is ARF3, also known as ETTIN (ETT), which has a long and intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (ETT-specific, ES domain; Simonini et al., 2018a), and this domain interacts with a set of alternative transcriptional regulators which include INDEHISCENT (IND), REPLUMLESS (RPL), and BREVIPEDICELLUS (BP; Simonini et al., 2016). All these transcription factors contribute to determining plant shape and pattern, and the role of ETT and its interactions with these other tissue identity factors has been especially well described during gynoecium development (Simonini et al., 2016, 2017, 2018b). Of particular interest is the observation that ETT controls growth and tissue patterning in an IAA-dependent mechanism that requires neither ubiquitination nor TIR1 (Simonini et al., 2016)., The Ostergaard group has shown that non-canonical auxin signalling via ETT is mediated by IAA interfering with the interaction of ETT with other transcriptional regulators, such as IND (Simonini et al., 2016). In a mechanism which parallels that of AUX/IAA repression of transcription in the canonical TIR1 pathway, ETT forms a repressive complex that is released by IAA to change patterns of transcription. Intensive analysis of the ES domain using informatics, mutagenesis, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), and expression techniques revealed long stretches with little sequence conservation interspersed with a series of short conserved motifs (Simonini et al., 2018a). The conserved motifs include a nuclear localization sequence and a serine-rich kinase site plus three others for which a function has yet to be identified. The low sequence conservation in the rest of the domain is consistent with a generally disordered structure which was confirmed using circular dichroism. Expressed and purified ES domain did not bind IAA, a finding that was attributed to the lack of structure. Yet, constructs of ES did confer full responsiveness to IAA when cloned in the Y2H system and assayed for interaction with IND. Most of the ES domain seems to be required for the interaction, although IAA sensitivity was lost when any of the serine residues was mutated from the kinase motif. Interestingly, single serine substututions at a site which appears to be specific to Arabidopsis and the Brassica family also knocked out ETT–IND binding, but this was not IAA dependent (Simonini et al., 2018b)., It is tempting to hypothesize that the residues necessary for IAA-dependent activity are directly involved in an auxin-sensing mechanism, either by contributing directly to binding or by contributing to a conformation conducive to interaction with IAA. However, the ETT effect has low sensitivity to auxin (treatments were generally between 50 μM and 100 μM IAA), is not triggered by the synthetic auxins 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or 1-naphthylacetic acid (1-NAA), and evolution of the ARF3 clade arose far more recently than the canonical auxin pathway (Mutte et al., 2018), making this an interesting, but somewhat idiosyncratic, non-canonical pathway. The role of ETT at the centre of a vital transcriptional hub is not in doubt, nor that this could influence and be influenced by local auxin dynamics, but the mode of action of auxin on ETT in planta remains somewhat less certain. The lack of IAA binding by the ES domain does not rule out a conformationally dependent binding pocket (Simonini et al., 2018a), but it is also possible, for example, that IAA is acting at these higher concentrations as a mimic of certain residues involved in intermolecular association, replacing them in the association and, hence, dissolving the interaction (Box 3)., The term ‘non-canonical auxin signalling’ has also been linked to different sets of protein kinases. It has been established for some years that the localization of the auxin efflux proteins known as PINs is, in some cases, determined by phosphorylation of target residues in their intracellular loops (Michniewicz et al., 2007; Dhonukshe et al., 2010). The D6 protein kinases, PINOID, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and PM-associated kinases are all implicated (Barbosa et al., 2014; Armengot et al., 2016; Dory et al., 2018; Haga et al., 2018; Marhavá et al., 2018) and all contribute to auxin action by moderating PIN protein localization and activity, some of them rapidly. Clearly, regulation of auxin action via its transport affects auxin signalling indirectly. Yet, kinase cascades are rapid and could be involved in rapid, non-canonical signalling. Indeed, not long ago, transmembrane kinases (TMKs) were linked to auxin signalling (Dai et al., 2013) and to rapid non-canonical auxin signalling via ABP1 (Xu et al., 2014). The TMKs form a subfamily of the plant receptor-like kinases (RLKs; Dai et al., 2013). The RLKs are a large and diverse family sharing a few structural features which include an extracellular domain that frequently acts as an activation domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain, sometimes with a phosphorelay receiver domain. The family does include receptors for other plant signals such as brassinosteroids but, since the foreshortening of the ABP1 story, we await further reports on TMK involvement in auxin signalling with interest., It is also clear that MAPK cascades are involved in many auxin-regulated response systems (Enders et al., 2017). The roles of MAPKs include phosphorylation of ROP Binding protein Kinase 1 (RBK1) leading to activation of members of the Rho‐like GTPases from Plants (ROP) which are small GTPases often linked to regulation of the cytoskeleton and auxin transport (Dai et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2014). The rapidity of the TIR1/AFB-dependent non-canonical signal (Box 2) makes a kinase cascade an attractive candidate relay mechanism, although no kinase has yet been linked to these activities., The proliferation of results implicating non-canonical pathways shows acute and continuing interest in the immediate consequences of IAA perception and a readiness to believe that auxin signalling is not limited to TIRs (Badescu and Napier, 2006). Rapid responses to auxins have been discussed previously in terms of a two-receptor concept (Scherer, 2011), although it remains possible that plants rely on one receptor (family) with two mechanisms of action. Auxins remain important for food security as herbicides (Quareshy et al., 2018), and so any new mechanistic understanding will contribute to how we manage these agrochemicals to retain utility and combat resistance (Busi et al., 2018). We now have some excellent new tools and assays to chase down unknown pathway contributors., MK was supported by the EU MSCA-IF project CrysPINs (792329).","authors":"Martin Kubeš, Richard Napier","keywords":"Arabidopsis, AUX/IAA transcriptional regulators, auxin, Auxin F-Box (AFB), Auxin Response Factors (ARFs), canonical auxin signalling pathway, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), non-canonical auxin signalling pathway, kinase, receptor, TIR1/AFB co-receptor, Transport Inhibitor Response 1 (TIR1), ubiquitination","pub_date":"13 April 2019","title":"Non-canonical auxin signalling: fast and curious","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/10/2609/5373062?rss=1"},{"origin":"Photosynthesis and Metabolism","abstract":"The influence of reduced glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) activity on leaf atmosphere CO2 and 13CO2 exchange was tested in transgenic Oryza sativa with the GDC H-subunit knocked down in leaf mesophyll cells.

In this study, we identified three flavonoid-7-O-di-glucosyltransferase (dGlcT) genes closely related to 1,2-rhamnosyltransferase (1,2RhaT) in citrus genomes. However, only 1,2RhaT was directly linked to the accumulation of neohesperidoside, as demonstrated by association analysis of 50 accessions and co-segregation analysis of an F1 population derived from Citrus reticulata × Poncirus trifoliata. In transgenic tobacco BY2 cells, over-expression of CitdGlcTs resulted in flavonoid-7-O-glucosides being catalysed into bitterless flavonoid-7-O-di-glucosides, whereas over-expression of Cit1,2RhaT converted the same substrate into bitter-tasting flavonoid-7-O-neohesperidoside. Unlike 1,2RhaT, during citrus fruit development the dGlcTs showed an opposite expression pattern to CHS and CHI, two genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes of flavonoid biosynthesis.

It is essential for cell growth and survival in yeast and mammals, with diverse substrate proteins. However, only a few studies on plant CCT have been reported to date, due to the essentiality of CCT subunit genes and the large size of the complex. Here, we have investigated the structure and function of the Arabidopsis CCT complex in detail. The plant CCT consisted of eight subunits that assemble to form a high-molecular-mass protein complex, shown by diverse methods. CCT-deficient cells exhibited depletion of cortical microtubules, accompanied by a reduction in cellular α- and β-tubulin levels due to protein degradation. Cycloheximide–chase assays suggested that CCT is involved in the folding of tubulins in plants. Furthermore, CCT interacted with PPX1, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 4, and may participate in the folding of PPX1 as its substrate. CCT also interacted with Tap46, a regulatory subunit of PP2A family phosphatases, but Tap46 appeared to function in PPX1 stabilization, rather than as a CCT substrate. Collectively, our findings reveal the essential functions of CCT chaperonin in plants and its conserved and novel substrates.","authors":"Hee-Kyung Ahn, Joong-Tak Yoon, Ilyeong Choi, Sumin Kim, Ho-Seok Lee, Hyun-Sook Pai","keywords":"CCT chaperonin, PP4 catalytic subunit, Tap46, TOR signaling pathway, tubulin biogenesis, virus-induced gene silencing","pub_date":"02 March 2019","title":"Functional characterization of chaperonin containing T-complex polypeptide-1 and its conserved and novel substrates in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/10/2741/5368542?rss=1"},{"origin":"Crop Molecular Genetics","abstract":"MYB-type transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in plant growth and development, and in the responses to several abiotic stresses.

Moreover, an osmyb102 knockout mutant showed an accelerated senescence phenotype under dark-induced and ABA-induced leaf senescence conditions. Microarray analysis showed that a variety of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) were down-regulated in the osmyb102-D line. Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB102 controls the expression of SAGs, including genes associated with ABA degradation and ABA signaling (OsABF4, OsNAP, and OsCYP707A6), under dark-induced senescence conditions. OsMYB102 inhibits ABA accumulation by directly activating the transcription of OsCYP707A6, which encodes the ABA catabolic enzyme ABSCISIC ACID 8′-HYDROXYLASE.

Subplastid fractionation demonstrated the differential sequestration of pigments in high- and low-intensity lines and revealed the PSY protein to be most active in the membrane fractions when abundance was highest in the fibril fractions. Carotenoid accumulation was associated with the esterification of xanthophylls, expression of a putative carotenoid acyl transferase, and increased fibril content within the plastid. Interrogation of TEM images and carotenoid analysis of subplastid fractions suggest that the plastoglobuli are likely to be the progenitor of the characteristic fibrils found in pepper fruit.

By characterizing numerous physiological features of several lines of different cold sensitivity, we show that a combination of both avoidance and tolerance is involved. A novel avoidance mechanism was found that favored unhindered development of the photosynthetic apparatus through protection of the shoot apex below soil level due to a shortened mesocotyl. It seems to be mediated by increased seedling photosensitivity at early growth stages. True tolerance involved improved protection of the cell membrane against cold injury at temperatures close to 0 °C and stimulation of light-induced processes (accumulation of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and chlorophyll, proper development of chloroplasts) at temperatures in the range of 10–14 °C, likely also related to the increased photosensitivity and mediated by gibberellin signaling.","authors":"Marcin Grzybowski, Józef Adamczyk, Maciej Jończyk, Alicja Sobkowiak, Jarosław Szczepanik, Kamil Frankiewicz, Jan Fronk, Paweł Sowiński","keywords":"Avoidance, chloroplasts, early growth, gibberellins, light-induced processes, mesocotyl, photosynthetic apparatus, shoot apex, tolerance, Zea mays","pub_date":"02 March 2019","title":"Increased photosensitivity at early growth as a possible mechanism of maize adaptation to cold springs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/10/2887/5368539?rss=1"},{"origin":"Plant—Environment Interactions","abstract":"Drought is a major abiotic stress that negatively influences crop yield.

In branches, the cell turgor loss point of leaves decreased, while the embolism resistance and conductivity of xylem, as well as conduit diameters, increased with height. High water-transport capacities allow ivy to compensate for the small cross-section of stems, while the limited resistance to drought-induced xylem dysfunction of the main stem is probably linked to conservative stomatal regulation.
