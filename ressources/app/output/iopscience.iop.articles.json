        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) construction of radial junction hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin film solar cells on standing silicon nanowires (SiNWs) is a promising strategy to maximize the light harvesting performance and improve the photocarrier collection in an optimized junction configuration. The unique light in-coupling and absorption behaviour in the antenna-like 3D photonic structures also necessitates a set of new theoretical models and simulation tools to design, predict and optimize the photovoltaic performance of radial junction solar cells, which can be rather different from planar junction solar cells. Recently, the performance of radial junction a-Si:H thin film solar cells has progressed steadily to a level comparable or even superior to that of their planar counterparts, with plenty of room for further improvement. This review will first address the growth strategy and critical parameter control of SiNWs produced via a plasma-assisted low-temperature vapour–liquid–solid procedure using low-melting-point metals as the catalyst. Then, the construction of high-performance radial junction thin film solar cells over the standing SiNW matrix, as well as their optimal structural designs, will be introduced. At the end, the new applications of 3D radial junction units will be summarized, which include, for example, the construction of very flexible, low-cost and efficient a-Si:H solar cells with the highest power-to-weight ratio, the demonstration of highly sensitive solar-blind photodetectors operating at the ultraviolet wavelength spectrum and the development of novel biomimetic radial tandem junction photodetectors with an intrinsic red–green–blue (RGB) colour distinguishing capability."

        "abstract": "Optical, electrical and magnetic properties of transition metal oxides (TMOs) can be switched by their non-stoichiometry, i.e. oxygen excess/deficiency and protonation. However, the switching classically needs high-temperature heating or electrochemistry in liquid electrolyte, which is unsuitable for device applications. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed thin films of water-incorporated 12CaO7Al2O3 nanoporous glass and NaTaO3 nanopillar glass. By applying the films to water-incorporated solid gate insulators of three-terminal thin-film transistors (TFTs), the confined water works as a strong reductant (H+)/oxidant (OH−) for the TMO channel, and their electro-optical and electromagnetic properties can be controlled by applying an electric field. Herein, we review our developed water-incorporated gate insulators and their application to three-terminal TFTs with TMOs of vanadium dioxide (VO2), tungsten trioxide (WO3) and strontium cobaltite (SrCoO x ). The present approach using a water-incorporated gate insulator provides a novel design concept to develop electrochemically switchable multifunctional devices based on TMOs operating at room temperature."

Thus seeking an effective technology for removing the airborne PMs or other pollutants is much desirable for alleviating the air pollution. The newly invented triboelectric nanotechnology can realize efficient air filtering with obvious advantages over traditional fibrous filtering and electrostatic precipitation. Here, a review is provided for recent progress in air filter by utilizing the triboelectric nanotechnology, starting from the choices of triboelectric materials and main features of triboelectric nanotechnology. The mechanism of triboelectric air filtering technology was presented as the coupling of triboelectric filtering and mechanical filtering. Then the approaches of air filtering were summarized as the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)-driven air filtering, TENG-enhanced nanofiber air filtering, and self-powered triboelectric air filtering. The device structure, working principle and filtering performance were systematically discussed. Furthermore, the industry products which have been developed based on the triboelectric filtering technology were introduced."

In addition, their safety properties need to be further enhanced to allow large-scale applications. In this context, new electrolytes with high lithium-ion (Li+) conductivity as well as good stability should be developed. Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing nanohybrid electrolytes. By combining organic (polymers, ionic liquids) and/or inorganic (Li+-conductive ceramics and glasses) functional constituents, a broad range of nanohybrid electrolytes with interesting chemical, mechanical and electrochemical properties have been designed and evaluated in different cell chemistry. This article aims to conduct a comprehensive review on the development of nanohybrid electrolytes in recent years (2012 to present). Specifically, we summarize and analyze the recent progress of gel-, inorganic- and polymer-based nanohybrid electrolytes with enhanced physicochemical properties and specified functionalities for their application in LIBs. Challenges and perspectives for future development of better nanohybrid LIB electrolytes are also discussed."

        "abstract": "Antibodies are considered the hallmark of the adaptive immune system in that they mediate various key biological functions, such as direct neutralization and recruitment of effector immune cells to eliminate invading pathogens. Antibodies exhibit several unique properties, including high diversity (enabling binding to a wide range of targets), high specificity and structural integrity. These properties and the understanding that antibodies can be utilized in a wide range of applications have motivated the scientific community to develop new approaches for antibody repertoire analysis and rapid monoclonal antibody discovery. Today, antibodies are key modules in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries. By virtue of their high affinity and specificity to their targets and the availability of technologies to engineer different antibodies to a wide range of targets, antibodies have become the most promising natural biological molecules in a range of biotechnological applications, such as: highly specific and sensitive nanobiosensors for the diagnostics of different biomarkers; nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery systems to certain cells or tissues; and nanomachines, which are nanoscale mechanical devices that enable energy conversion into precise mechanical motions in response to specific molecular inputs. In this review, we start by describing the unique properties of antibodies, how antibody diversity is generated, and the available technologies for antibody repertoire analysis and antibody discovery. Thereafter, we provide an overview of some antibody-based nanotechnologies and discuss novel and promising approaches for the application of antibodies in the nanotechnology field. Overall, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap between the nanotechnology and antibody engineering disciplines by demonstrating how technological advances in the antibody field can be leveraged to develop and/or enhance new technological approaches in the nanotechnology field."

        "abstract": "The spin–orbit Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 has attracted a lot of interest in recent years from theory and experiment due to its close connection to isostructural high-temperature copper oxide superconductors. Despite not being superconductive, its spectral features closely resemble those of the cuprates, including Fermi surface and pseudogap properties. In this article, we review and extend recent work in the theoretical description of the spectral function of pure and electron-doped Sr2IrO4 based on a cluster extension of dynamical mean-field theory ('oriented-cluster DMFT') and compare it to available angle-resolved photoemission data. Current theories provide surprisingly good agreement for pure and electron-doped Sr2IrO4, both in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. Most notably, one obtains simple explanations for the experimentally observed steep feature around the M point and the pseudo-gap-like spectral feature in electron-doped Sr2IrO4."

        "abstract": "With the advances in fabrication of materials with feature sizes at the order of nanometers, it has been possible to alter their thermal transport properties dramatically. Miniaturization of device size increases the power density in general, hence faster electronics require better thermal transport, whereas better thermoelectric applications require the opposite. Such diverse needs bring new challenges for material design. Shrinkage of length scales has also changed the experimental and theoretical methods to study thermal transport. Unsurprisingly, novel approaches have emerged to control phonon flow. Besides, ever increasing computational power is another driving force for developing new computational methods. In this review, we discuss three methods developed for computing vibrational thermal transport properties of nano-structured systems, namely Green function, quasi-classical Langevin, and Kubo–Green methods. The Green function methods are explained using both nonequilibrium expressions and the Landauer-type formula. The partitioning scheme, decimation techniques and surface Green functions are reviewed, and a simple model for reservoir Green functions is shown. The expressions for the Kubo–Greenwood method are derived, and Lanczos tridiagonalization, continued fraction and Chebyshev polynomial expansion methods are discussed. Additionally, the quasi-classical Langevin approach, which is useful for incorporating phonon–phonon and other scatterings is summarized."

Here we review the physics of one intriguing class of interaction-driven quantum Hall states: quantum Hall valley nematics. These phases of matter emerge when the formation of a topologically insulating quantum Hall state is accompanied by the spontaneous breaking of a point-group symmetry that combines a spatial rotation with a permutation of valley indices. The resulting orientational order is particularly sensitive to quenched disorder, while quantum Hall physics links charge conduction to topological defects. We discuss how these combine to yield a rich phase structure, and their implications for transport and spectroscopy measurements. In parallel, we discuss relevant experimental systems. We close with an outlook on future directions."

        "abstract": "Biofilms are communities of sessile microbes that are bound to each other by a matrix made of biopolymers and proteins. Spatial structure is present in biofilms on many lengthscales. These range from the nanometer scale of molecular motifs to the hundred-micron scale of multicellular aggregates. Spatial structure is a physical property that impacts the biology of biofilms in many ways. The molecular structure of matrix components controls their interaction with each other (thereby impacting biofilm mechanics) and with diffusing molecules such as antibiotics and immune factors (thereby impacting antibiotic tolerance and evasion of the immune system). The size and structure of multicellular aggregates, combined with microbial consumption of growth substrate, give rise to differentiated microenvironments with different patterns of metabolism and gene expression. Spatial association of more than one species can benefit one or both species, while distances between species can both determine and result from the transport of diffusible factors between species. Thus, a widespread theme in the biological importance of spatial structure in biofilms is the effect of structure on transport. We survey what is known about this and other effects of spatial structure in biofilms, from molecules up to multispecies ecosystems. We conclude with an overview of what experimental approaches have been developed to control spatial structure in biofilms and how these and other experiments can be complemented with computational work."

The past decades have witnessed fast development in the first-principles methodologies and their applications to ordering transitions in multi-component alloys, particularly the high-entropy alloys. The driving force for the proceedings comes from (i) the advance of algorithms and increasingly cheaper hardware, and also (ii) the great passion to model alloys with increasing number of components. The review starts with a brief introduction of the history for the ordering transitions. More detailed scientific proceedings prior to the 1970s had been well summarized in Krivoglaz and Smirnov (1965 The Theory of Order-Disorder in Alloys (New York: Elsevier)) and Stoloff and Davies (1968 Prog. Mater. Sci. 13 1–84). In the second part, the methods to study the ordering transitions, primarily on the theoretic methods are introduced. These will include (i) KKR-CPA method and supercell methods for energetic calculations; and (ii) thermodynamic and statistical methods to compute the transition temperatures. The third part will focus on representative applications in alloys, including our own work and many others. This part supplies the primary information of this review to the readers. The fourth part will summarize the connections between ordering transitions and broader physical properties (e.g. the mechanical properties). In the last part, some concluding remarks and perspectives will be given."

Printed electronics have recently adopted metal oxides to push the limits of performance and stability for flexible thin film systems.

        "origin": "Methods and Applications in Fluorescence",
        "pub_date": "11 April 2019",
        "abstract": "Optical polarization features associated with the fundamental processes of molecular fluorescence and resonance energy transfer are in general studied with reference to plane polarizations. When any of the species involved is chiral, the associated emission processes may exhibit an element of circular polarization—a degree of optical helicity. Although usually a minor effect, some systems can exhibit a sizeable component of circularly polarized luminescence, whose helicity correlates with the enantiomeric form. In studies of multi-component systems, in which initial excitation of a donor species—followed by energy transfer—leads to emission from an acceptor molecule, the handedness of both donor and acceptor may influence output circularity. In systems with an achiral acceptor, a degree of fluorescence circularity may be influenced by the handedness of a chiral donor, but this should not be construed in terms of 'conveying' chirality. Chiral molecules may also play a passive role by inducing helicity in the fluorescence from achiral neighbours, and further tiers of complexity arise if the initial excitation is itself of circular polarization. In all such processes, symmetry principles play a major role in determining a sensitivity to molecular handedness, and their detailed consideration enables a range of new experimental procedures to be identified. Casting the fundamental theory in terms of formal photon-molecule couplings enables the quantum mechanisms involved in all such phenomena to be clearly resolved. The results provide fresh physical insights, and establish connections across a range of indirectly related chiroptical phenomena including induced circular dichroism."

        "abstract": "While conventional material fabrication methods focus on form and strength to achieve function, the fabrication of material systems for emerging life science applications will need to satisfy a more subtle set of requirements. A common goal for biofabrication is to recapitulate complex biological contexts (e.g. tissue) for applications that range from animal-on-a-chip to regenerative medicine. In these cases, the material systems will need to: (i) present appropriate surface functionalities over a hierarchy of length scales (e.g. molecular features that enable cell adhesion and topographical features that guide differentiation); (ii) provide a suite of mechanobiological cues that promote the emergence of native-like tissue form and function; and (iii) organize structure to control cellular ingress and molecular transport, to enable the development of an interconnected cellular community that is engaged in cell signaling. And these requirements are not likely to be static but will vary over time and space, which will require capabilities of the material systems to dynamically respond, adapt, heal and reconfigure. Here, we review recent advances in the use of electrically based fabrication methods to build material systems from biological macromolecules (e.g. chitosan, alginate, collagen and silk). Electrical signals are especially convenient for fabrication because they can be controllably imposed to promote the electrophoresis, alignment, self-assembly and functionalization of macromolecules to generate hierarchically organized material systems. Importantly, this electrically based fabrication with biologically derived materials (i.e. electrobiofabrication) is complementary to existing methods (photolithographic and printing), and enables access to the biotechnology toolbox (e.g. enzymatic-assembly and protein engineering, and gene expression) to offer exquisite control of structure and function. We envision that electrobiofabrication will emerge as an important platform technology for organizing soft matter into dynamic material systems that mimic biology's complexity of structure and versatility of function."

In this article, we review the key concepts pertaining to topological phases in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with relevant examples and realistic model setups. Discussions are devoted to both the adaptations of topological invariants from Hermitian to non-Hermitian systems, as well as origins of new topological invariants in the latter setup. Unique properties such as exceptional points and complex energy landscapes lead to new topological invariants including winding number/vorticity defined solely in the complex energy plane, and half-integer winding/Chern numbers. New forms of Kramers degeneracy appear here rendering distinct topological invariants. Modifications of adiabatic theory, time-evolution operator, biorthogonal bulk-boundary correspondence lead to unique features such as topological displacement of particles, 'skin-effect', and edge-selective attenuated and amplified topological polarizations without chiral symmetry. Extension and realization of topological ideas in photonic systems are mentioned. We conclude with discussions on relevant future directions, and highlight potential applications of some of these unique topological features of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians."

Even if cell growth is achieved in 3D tissue scaffolds or advanced implants, tissue viability inevitably requires vascularization, as diffusion can only transport nutrients and eliminate debris within a few hundred microns. This engineered vasculature may need to mimic the intricate branching geometry of native microvasculature, referred to herein as vascular complexity, to efficiently deliver blood and recreate critical interactions between the vascular and perivascular cells as well as parenchymal tissues. This review first describes the importance of vascular complexity in labs- and organs-on-chips, the biomechanical and biochemical signals needed to create and maintain a complex vasculature, and the limitations of current 2D, 2.5D, and 3D culture systems in recreating vascular complexity. We then critically review available strategies for design and biofabrication of complex vasculatures in cell culture platforms, labs- and organs-on-chips, and tissue engineering scaffolds, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, challenges and future directions are outlined with the hope of inspiring researchers to create the reliable, efficient and sustainable tools needed for design and biofabrication of complex vasculatures."

It discusses the current understanding of metabolic pathways that contribute to exhaled VOC production in lung cancer and reviews the research conducted to date. Finally, we highlight important areas for future research and discuss how a breath test could be incorporated into various clinical pathways."

        "abstract": "Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) reflects eosinophilic airway inflammation and it can be used to diagnose and phenotype asthma and predict treatment responses. However, smoking decreases FeNO and it is not clear if FeNO has clinical value in smoking subjects with asthma. We conducted a systematic review focusing on four basic characteristics and five clinical questions on using FeNO in smokers with asthma. At least two authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed the quality of the included studies. Data were synthesised mainly by qualitative methods. Twenty-two studies were included. FeNO is lower in smoking than in non-smoking asthmatics, but importantly FeNO is higher in untreated smoking asthmatics than in healthy smokers. Information was incomplete but there is some indication that FeNO might be useful in detecting eosinophilic airway inflammation and in diagnosing asthma in smoking subjects. There was no data available to four of the five clinical questions. In conclusion, at the moment there is insufficient data to give specific guidelines on using FeNO in smoking subjects, but although smoking decreases FeNO it does not seem to make FeNO measurement redundant. FeNO is also associated with asthma in smokers and current results encourage conducting clinical trials on FeNO in smokers with asthma."

        "abstract": "One of the main causes of the high mortality rate in lung cancer is the late-stage tumor detection. Early diagnosis is therefore essential to increase the chances of obtaining an effective treatment quickly thus increasing the survival rate. Current screening techniques are based on imaging, with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) as the pivotal approach. Even if LDCT has high accuracy, its invasiveness and high false positive rate limit its application to high-risk population screening. A non-invasive, cost-efficient, and easy-to-use test should instead be designed as an alternative. Exhaled breath contains thousands of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Since ancient times, it has been understood that changes in the VOCs' mixture may be directly related to the presence of a disease, and recent studies have quantified the change in the compounds' concentration. Analyzing exhaled breath to achieve lung cancer early diagnosis represents a non-invasive, low-cost, and user-friendly approach, thus being a promising candidate for high-risk lung cancer population screening. This review discusses technological solutions that have been proposed in the literature as tools to analyze exhaled breath for lung cancer diagnosis, together with factors that potentially affect the outcome of the analysis. Even if research on this topic started many years ago, and many different technological approaches have since been adopted, there is still no validated clinical application of this technique. Standard guidelines and protocols should be defined by the medical community in order to translate exhaled breath analysis to clinical practice."

        "abstract": "Optical microscopy has served biomedical research for decades due to its high temporal and spatial resolutions. Among various optical imaging techniques, fluorescence imaging offers superb sensitivity down to single molecule level but its multiplexing capacity is limited by intrinsically broad bandwidth. To simultaneously capture a vast number of targets, the newly emerging vibrational microscopy technique draws increasing attention as vibration spectroscopy features narrow transition linewidth. Nonetheless, unlike fluorophores that have been studied for centuries, a systematic investigation on vibrational probes is underemphasized. Herein, we reviewed some of the recent developments of vibrational probes for multiplex imaging applications, particularly those serving stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, which is one of the most promising vibrational imaging techniques. We wish to summarize the general guidelines for developing bioorthogonal vibrational probes with high sensitivity, chemical specificity and most importantly, tunability to fulfill super-multiplexed optical imaging. Future directions to significantly improve the performance are also discussed."

        "abstract": "Epiblast is composed of pluripotent cells which will give rise to all cell lineages in a human body. It forms a single-cell layered epithelium conserved among all amniotic vertebrates (birds, reptiles and mammals) and undergoes complex morphogenesis both before and during gastrulation. Our knowledge of the amniote epiblast is based on data acquired through cellular and molecular analyses of early chick and mouse embryos in vivo and mammalian pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro. Very few studies have been published on biomechanical characteristics of the amniote epiblast, largely due to lack of experimental tools for measuring and perturbing biomechanical properties. Also missing is a conceptual framework that can integrate both biomechanical and molecular parameters of the epiblast. This review is aimed at providing a background based on which epiblast morphogenesis, including its transition between the epithelial and mesenchymal states, can be understood from a biomechanical perspective. This simple developmental biology system is suitable for testing a multitude of theoretical models in biomechanics, leading to a better understanding of biomechanical logics and constraints governing multicellular organization."

Achieving a better understanding of the flow field perception algorithms of the lateral line can contribute not only to the design of highly sensitive flow sensors, but also to the development of underwater smart skin with good hydrodynamic imaging properties. In this review, we discuss highly sensitive flow-sensing mechanisms for superficial and canal neuromasts and flow field perception algorithms. Artificial lateral line systems with different transduction mechanisms are then described with special emphasis on the recent innovations in the field of polymer-based artificial flow sensors. Finally, we discuss our perspective of the technological challenges faced while improving flow sensitivity, durability, and sensing fusion schemes."

        "abstract": "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers an ample range of complementary techniques which are able to provide essential information about the physical, chemical and structural properties of materials at the atomic scale, and hence makes a vast impact on our understanding of materials science, especially in the field of semiconductor one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures. Recent advancements in TEM instrumentation, in particular aberration correction and monochromation, have enabled pioneering experiments in complex nanostructure material systems. This review aims to address these understandings through the applications of the methodology for semiconductor nanostructures. It points out various electron microscopy techniques, in particular scanning TEM (STEM) imaging and spectroscopy techniques, with their already-employed or potential applications on 1D nanostructured semiconductors. We keep the main focus of the paper on the electronic and optoelectronic properties of such semiconductors, and avoid expanding it further. In the first part of the review, we give a brief introduction to each of the STEM-based techniques, without detailed elaboration, and mention the recent technological and conceptual developments which lead to novel characterization methodologies. For further reading, we refer the audience to a handful of papers in the literature. In the second part, we highlight the recent examples of application of the STEM methodology on the 1D nanostructure semiconductor materials, especially III–V, II–V, and group IV bare and heterostructure systems. The aim is to address the research questions on various physical properties and introduce solutions by choosing the appropriate technique that can answer the questions. Potential applications will also be discussed, the ones that have already been used for bulk and 2D materials, and have shown great potential and promise for 1D nanostructure semiconductors."

        "abstract": "The paper reviews the state of the art in the field of interaction of low temperature plasmas generated during electrospraying with the liquid cone and jet. Many studies are focused at practical applications of electrospraying, for example to mass spectrometry, electrospinning of nanofibers, thin film deposition, nanoparticle production, ink-jet printing, etc, but the phenomenon of electrically generated plasma due to gas ionization accompanying the electrospraying is frequently ignored. The effect of electrical discharge on the electrospraying process depends on the type of the discharge. When glow corona or onset streamers are generated, the electrospray is stabilized in the classical cone-jet mode, however, for breakdown streamers, sparks, or arc discharges, the electrospraying process is disturbed and irregular modes (spindle, multispindle or ramified jet) occur. The electrospray-discharge interaction phenomena have been studied by photographic recording, electric current measurements, mass spectrometry and optical emission spectroscopy. Some studies show that the current carried by the ions generated in this plasma and flowing through the drift region to the opposite electrode can be higher than the current carried by the electrosprayed droplets. This effect has been proved by separation of both currents using a specially designed device. To prevent the distortion of the electrospray process, various strategies have been developed: modification of the electric field in the vicinity of capillary nozzle, stabilization of the glow corona, reduction of the surface tension of liquid. Recently, the physical processes and phenomena occurring in electrical discharge plasmas during electrospraying of liquids find new application in decontamination of liquids or in material processing. The advantage of the coupled electrospray-plasma process is that the liquid atomization is combined with plasma chemical processes within the same device, by using the same power supply applied to the capillary nozzle."

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional printing (3DP), the fastest growing manufacturing community, in a quest to capitalize its principal advantage of customization is exceedingly seeking functional materials. Piezoelectric materials are one such type of functional material desired for their linear electromechanical and thermoelectric behavior. The ability to 3D print piezoelectric material opens up a new demographic of integrated and personalized smart devices serving from aerospace to biomedical applications. Being self-powered further renders them a competing material for devices used in remote locations: inside the human body, and confined and inaccessible spaces. The review evaluates the significance of 3DP structures over their conventionally fabricated counterparts as well as those of 3D structures over 2D and 1D equivalents. Although, 3DP of these materials is successfully attempted using various techniques, there remain concerns in optimizing the function with the form. This review analyzes the current 3DP techniques available for piezoelectric material and addresses the challenges in realizing ready-to-use piezoelectric sensors and applying them in multi-material printing by resolving the issues associated with electrode formation and poling. As all the current characterization techniques are restricted to 2D geometries, we propose a list of potential techniques to efficiently characterize 3D piezoelectric structures. Finally, a road-map is provided to choose an appropriate 3DP technique and the corresponding material system pertaining to a given application."

        "abstract": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has been an important tool in neuroscience with applications in neuroscience, neural engineering (e.g. Brain–computer interfaces, BCI's), and even commercial applications. Many of the analytical tools used in EEG studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently, the availability of large EEG data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of EEG signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal, a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to EEG classification was performed to address the following critical questions: (1) Which EEG classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? (2) What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? (3) Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks? Approach. A systematic literature review of EEG classification using deep learning was performed on Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 90 identified studies. Those studies were analyzed based on type of task, EEG preprocessing methods, input type, and deep learning architecture. Main results. For EEG classification tasks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep belief networks outperform stacked auto-encoders and multi-layer perceptron neural networks in classification accuracy. The tasks that used deep learning fell into five general groups: emotion recognition, motor imagery, mental workload, seizure detection, event related potential detection, and sleep scoring. For each type of task, we describe the specific input formulation, major characteristics, and end classifier recommendations found through this review. Significance. This review summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes in the use of deep learning for EEG classification. Practical suggestions on the selection of many hyperparameters are provided in the hope that they will promote or guide the deployment of deep learning to EEG datasets in future research."

These systems are driven by external energy input, for example provided by an external fuel reservoir. The external energy input gives rise to novel phenomena that are not present in passive systems. For instance, concentration gradients can spatially organise emulsions and cause novel droplet size distributions. Another example are active droplets that are subject to chemical reactions such that their nucleation and size can be controlled, and they can divide spontaneously. In this review, we discuss the physics of phase separation and emulsions and show how the concepts that govern such phenomena can be extended to capture the physics of active emulsions. This physics is relevant to the spatial organisation of the biochemistry in living cells, for the development of novel applications in chemical engineering and models for the origin of life."

Particular attention is devoted to catalytic olefination using freons as an efficient synthetic route to fluorinated compounds. The application of unsymmetrical fluorine-containing N-heterocyclic carbene ligands as catalysts for olefin metathesis is demonstrated. A variety of classes of organofluorine compounds are considered, in particular, polyfluorinated arenes and 1,2-diaminobenzenes, 1-halo-2-trifluoroacetylacetylenes, α-fluoronitro compounds, fluorinated heterocycles, 2-hydrazinylidene-1,3-dicarbonyl derivatives, imines and silanes. The potential practical applications of organofluorine compounds in fundamental organic chemistry, materials science and biomedicine are outlined.  The bibliography includes 1019 references."

For instance, 2D metal nanosheets (2DMNSs) have attracted a significant amount of attention owing to their interesting properties, which are absent in corresponding bulk counterparts, and they have been confirmed to have potential applications in electrocatalysis, optics, and biomedicine. However, because of the close-packed structures of metals, the large-scale fabrication of 2DMNSs is challenging. In this review, we have outlined the research progress in the field of 2DMNSs, including the typical synthesis approaches and newly developed methods, as well as promising applications of the materials reported in recent years. Moreover, some preliminary and promising strategies to further improve the properties of 2DMNSs and some insights for the development of the field have been included."

In this review, we aim to give an integrated summarization about the recent advances in binary as well as ternary Sb-based III–V NWs, starting from the fundamental properties, NWs growth mechanism, typical synthetic methods to their applications in transistors, photodetectors, and Majorana fermions detection. Up to now, famous NWs growth techniques of solid-source chemical vapor deposition (CVD), molecular beam epitaxy, metal organic vapor phase epitaxy and metal organic CVD etc have been adopted and developed for the controllable growth of Sb-based III–V NWs. Several parameters including heating temperature, III/V ratio of source materials, growth temperature, catalyst size and kinds, and growth substrate play important roles on the morphology, position, diameter distribution, growth orientation and crystal phase of Sb-based III–V NWs. Furthermore, we discuss the photoelectrical applications of Sb-based III–V NWs such as field-effect-transistors, tunnel diode, low-power inverter, and infrared detectors etc. Importantly, due to the strongest spin–orbit interaction and giant g-factor among all III–V semiconductors, InSb with the geometry of one-dimension NW is considered as the most promising candidate for the detection of Majorana fermions. In the end, we also summarize the main challenges remaining in the field and put forward some suggestions for the future development of Sb-based III–V NWs."

        "abstract": "The basic theoretical understanding of light interacting with nanostructured metals that has existed since the early 1900s has become more relevant in the last two decades, largely because of new approaches to structure metals down to the nanometer scale or smaller. Here, a broad overview of the concepts and applications of nanostructuring metals for light-based technologies is given. The theory of the response of metals to an applied oscillating field is given, including a discussion of nonlocal, nonlinear and quantum effects. Using this metal response, the guiding of electromagnetic (light) waves using metals is given, with a particular emphasis on the impact of nanostructured metals for tighter confinement and slower propagation. Similarly, the influence of metal nanostructures on light scattering by isolated metal structures, like nanoparticles and nanoantennas, is described, with basic results presented including plasmonic/circuit resonances, the single channel limit, directivity enhancement, the maximum power transfer theorem, limits on the magnetic response from kinetic inductance and the scaling of gap plasmons to the nanometer scale and smaller. A brief overview of nanofabrication approaches to creating metal nanostructures is given. Finally, existing and emerging light-based applications are presented, including those for sensing, spectroscopy (including local refractive index, Raman, IR absorption), detection (including Schottky detectors), switching (including terahertz photoconductive antennas), modulation, energy harvesting and photocatalysis, light emission (including lasers and tunneling based light emission), optical tweezing, nonlinear optics, subwavelength imaging and lithography and high density data storage."

Here, we present a pedagogical treatmement of a simulation formalism based on the method of Jones matrices. We focus on toroidal geometries as an example and perform computer simulations of the nematic textures seen between crossed-polarizers. For tangentially-anchored nematic tori, we compare qualitative and quantitative features between experimental and simulated OPM textures and discuss the influence of twist in the director field. In addition, we quantify the effect of averaging over multiple wavelengths, the effect of voxel size, how refraction affects the comparison between experimental and simulated OPM textures, and the effect of deviations from the toroidal shape. For homeotropically-anchored nematic tori, we adapt the classic escaped-radial director field found in homeotropically-anchored capillaries to a toroidal geometry to produce simulated OPM textures. Lastly, we show that the same signatures of twist in the tangentially-anchored nematic toroids persist in the homeotropically-anchored nematic toroids."

These hybrid heterostructures (HSs) can be built as vertical van der Waals stacks, resulting in a 2D interface, or as stitched adjacent monolayer crystals, resulting in one-dimensional (1D) interfaces. Although most attention has been focused on vertical HSs, increasing theoretical and experimental interest in 1D interfaces is evident. In-plane interfacial states between different 2D materials inherit properties from both crystals, giving rise to robust states with unique 1D non-parabolic dispersion and strong spin–orbit effects. With such unique characteristics, these states provide an exciting platform for realizing 1D physics. Here, we review and discuss advances in 1D heterojunctions, with emphasis on theoretical approaches for describing those between semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides MX 2 (with M  =  Mo, W and X  =  S, Se, Te), and how the interfacial states can be characterized and utilized. We also address how the interfaces depend on edge geometries (such as zigzag and armchair) or strain, as lattice parameters differ across the interface, and how these features affect excitonic/optical response. This review is intended to serve as a resource for promoting theoretical and experimental studies in this rapidly evolving field."

In this review, ZnO-based photodetectors are summarized, from pure pyroelectric detectors and traditional photon detectors based on internal photoelectric effects to the hybridized photodetectors with pyroelectric and photoelectric effects. Also, the pyro-phototronic effect is presented as an efficient way to solve the slow response problem of most ZnO-based photodetectors by naturally coupling the light-self-induced pyroelectric effect and internal photoelectric effect. Lastly, we review the recent achievements of these ZnO-based photodetectors, discuss the challenges and look forward to the future of pyro-phototronic effect enhanced photodetectors."

        "abstract": "Benefiting from the unique non-central symmetric crystal structure, groups II–VI and III–V wurtzite semiconductors, for example, ZnO, AlN, GaN, and InN, possess the piezoelectric property. Carrier behaviors, including generation, transport, separation, and recombination, can be effectively modulated/controlled by piezotronic and piezo-phototronic effects, that control the piezoelectric polarization charges generated at the interface via applying external stress on the polarization orientation of these semiconductors, and then form the piezopotential used as a 'gate' to tune and further improve the performance of semiconductor devices. Based on these advanced properties, a large number of piezotronic and piezo-phototronic devices and applications have been researched, like light emitting diodes, solar cells, sensors, human–machine interfaces, nanogenerators, and so on, and suggest the dramatic improvement of operating efficiency compared to that with no external strain. Moreover, piezotronic and piezo-phototronic effects provide a convenient and economical method to effectively relieve various issues of semiconductor devices, instead of the traditional ways, requiring complicated design, high costs, and a long period of time. This brief review mainly concentrates on the fundamental physical mechanism and correlative devices and applications on emerging piezotronic and piezo-phototronic effects, and wishes to provide scientific guidance on potential functional applications for the future."

The accumulated set of these data comprising the number density and temperature of the metastable, N * and T  g , as well as the electron density n  e  in various kinds of low-temperature plasmas over a wide range of external parameters enable the analysis and review of the inner plasma parameter in the form of relative densities,  and  normalized by the feed gas density N  g , under a theoretical basis for the correlation derived from a rate equation in real space. The development of non-invasive diagnostics for metastables by tunable diode laser in the visible, near-infrared domain (<1 m) has been indispensable. This has enabled optical absorption spectroscopy for measurements of N * and T  g  of metastables in argon. A reasonable correlation was found between  and  during the steady-state phase in capacitively and inductively coupled plasmas, and micro hollow cathode discharge. However, there exists a large deviation from theory in atmospheric pressure and helicon discharges. A high degree of positive correlation between  and  demonstrates that the metastable density N * can be an indirect indicator of the plasma density in a low-temperature plasma. Doppler-shifted laser-induced fluorescence to determine the two-dimensional velocity distribution of neutral metastables close to the plasma–wall interface is discussed as a probe of plasma–wall interaction."

        "abstract": "Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) offer exciting opportunities to test the manifestations of many-body interactions through changes in the charge density. The two-dimensional character and reduced screening in ML-TMDs lead to the formation of neutral and charged excitons with binding energies orders of magnitude larger than those in conventional bulk semiconductors. Tuning the charge density by a gate voltage leads to profound changes in the optical spectra of excitons in ML-TMDs. On the one hand, the increased screening at large charge densities should result in a blueshift of the exciton spectral lines due to reduction in the binding energy. On the other hand, exchange and correlation effects that shrink the band-gap energy at elevated charge densities (band-gap renormalization) should result in a redshift of the exciton spectral lines. While these competing effects can be captured through various approximations that model long-wavelength charge excitations in the Bethe–Salpeter equation, we show that a novel coupling between excitons and shortwave charge excitations is essential to resolve several experimental puzzles. Unlike ubiquitous and well-studied plasmons, driven by collective oscillations of the background charge density in the long-wavelength limit, we discuss the emergence of shortwave plasmons that originate from the short-range Coulomb interaction through which electrons transition between the  and  valleys. The shortwave plasmons have a finite energy-gap because of the removal of spin-degeneracy in both the valence- and conduction-band valleys (a consequence of breaking of inversion symmetry in combination with strong spin–orbit coupling in ML-TMDs). We study the coupling between the shortwave plasmons and the neutral exciton through the self-energy of the latter. We then elucidate how this coupling as well as the spin ordering in the conduction band give rise to an experimentally observed optical sideband in electron-doped W-based MLs, conspicuously absent in electron-doped Mo-based MLs or any hole-doped ML-TMDs. While the focus of this review is on the optical manifestations of many-body effects in ML-TMDs, a systematic description of the dynamical screening and its various approximations allow one to revisit other phenomena, such as nonequilibrium transport or superconducting pairing, where the use of the Bethe–Salpeter equation or the emergence of shortwave plasmons can play an important role."
